    "page_content": "it is the supporter of the world, that condition of all phenomena, of all\nobjects which is always pre-supposed throughout experience; for all that\nexists, exists only for the subject. Every one finds himself to be\nsubject, yet only in so far as he knows, not in so far as he is an object\nof knowledge. But his body is object, and therefore from this point of\nview we call it idea. For the body is an object among objects, and is\nconditioned by the laws of objects, although it is an immediate object.\nLike all objects of perception, it lies within the universal forms of\nknowledge, time and space, which are the conditions of multiplicity. The\nsubject, on the contrary, which is always the knower, never the known,\ndoes not come under these forms, but is presupposed by them; it has\ntherefore neither multiplicity nor its opposite unity. We never know it,\nbut it is always the knower wherever there is knowledge.\n\nSo then the world as idea, the only aspect in which we consider it at\npresent, has two fundamental, necessary, and inseparable halves. The one\nhalf is the object, the forms of which are space and time, and through\nthese multiplicity. The other half is the subject, which is not in space\nand time, for it is present, entire and undivided, in every percipient\nbeing. So that any one percipient being, with the object, constitutes the\nwhole world as idea just as fully as the existing millions could do; but\nif this one were to disappear, then the whole world as idea would cease to\nbe. These halves are therefore inseparable even for thought, for each of\nthe two has meaning and existence only through and for the other, each\nappears with the other and vanishes with it. They limit each other\nimmediately; where the object begins the subject ends. The universality of\nthis limitation is shown by the fact that the essential and hence\nuniversal forms of all objects, space, time, and causality, may, without\nknowledge of the object, be discovered and fully known from a\nconsideration of the subject, _i.e._, in Kantian language, they lie _a\npriori_ in our consciousness. That he discovered this is one of Kant’s\nprincipal merits, and it is a great one. I however go beyond this, and\nmaintain that the principle of sufficient reason is the general expression\nfor all these forms of the object of which we are _a priori_ conscious;\nand that therefore all that we know purely _a priori_, is merely the\ncontent of that principle and what follows from it; in it all our certain\n_a priori_ knowledge is expressed. In my essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason I have shown in detail how every possible object comes\nunder it; that is, stands in a necessary relation to other objects, on the\none side as determined, on the other side as determining: this is of such\nwide application, that the whole existence of all objects, so far as they\nare objects, ideas and nothing more, may be entirely traced to this their\nnecessary relation to each other, rests only in it, is in fact merely\nrelative; but of this more presently. I have further shown, that the\nnecessary relation which the principle of sufficient reason expresses\ngenerally, appears in other forms corresponding to the classes into which\nobjects are divided, according to their possibility; and again that by\nthese forms the proper division of the classes is tested. I take it for\ngranted that what I said in this earlier essay is known and present to the\nreader, for if it had not been already said it would necessarily find its\nplace here.",

    "page_content": "reason, which appears in pure time as such, and on which all counting and\narithmetical calculation rests, has completely mastered the nature of\ntime. Time is nothing more than that form of the principle of sufficient\nreason, and has no further significance. Succession is the form of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason in time, and succession is the whole nature\nof time. Further, whoever has recognised the principle of sufficient\nreason as it appears in the presentation of pure space, has exhausted the\nwhole nature of space, which is absolutely nothing more than that\npossibility of the reciprocal determination of its parts by each other,\nwhich is called position. The detailed treatment of this, and the\nformulation in abstract conceptions of the results which flow from it, so\nthat they may be more conveniently used, is the subject of the science of\ngeometry. Thus also, whoever has recognised the law of causation, the\naspect of the principle of sufficient reason which appears in what fills\nthese forms (space and time) as objects of perception, that is to say\nmatter, has completely mastered the nature of matter as such, for matter\nis nothing more than causation, as any one will see at once if he\nreflects. Its true being is its action, nor can we possibly conceive it as\nhaving any other meaning. Only as active does it fill space and time; its\naction upon the immediate object (which is itself matter) determines that\nperception in which alone it exists. The consequence of the action of any\nmaterial object upon any other, is known only in so far as the latter acts\nupon the immediate object in a different way from that in which it acted\nbefore; it consists only of this. Cause and effect thus constitute the\nwhole nature of matter; its true being is its action. (A fuller treatment\nof this will be found in the essay on the Principle of Sufficient Reason,\n§ 21, p. 77.) The nature of all material things is therefore very\nappropriately called in German _Wirklichkeit_,(6) a word which is far more\nexpressive than _Realität_. Again, that which is acted upon is always\nmatter, and thus the whole being and essence of matter consists in the\norderly change, which one part of it brings about in another part. The\nexistence of matter is therefore entirely relative, according to a\nrelation which is valid only within its limits, as in the case of time and\nspace.\n\nBut time and space, each for itself, can be mentally presented apart from\nmatter, whereas matter cannot be so presented apart from time and space.\nThe form which is inseparable from it presupposes space, and the action in\nwhich its very existence consists, always imports some change, in other\nwords a determination in time. But space and time are not only, each for\nitself, presupposed by matter, but a union of the two constitutes its\nessence, for this, as we have seen, consists in action, _i.e._, in\ncausation. All the innumerable conceivable phenomena and conditions of\nthings, might be coexistent in boundless space, without limiting each\nother, or might be successive in endless time without interfering with\neach other: thus a necessary relation of these phenomena to each other,\nand a law which should regulate them according to such a relation, is by\nno means needful, would not, indeed, be applicable: it therefore follows\nthat in the case of all co-existence in space and change in time, so long\nas each of these forms preserves for itself its condition and its course\nwithout any connection with the other, there can be no causation, and\nsince causation constitutes the essential nature of matter, there can be\nno matter. But the law of causation receives its meaning and necessity\nonly from this, that the essence of change does not consist simply in the\nmere variation of things, but rather in the fact that at the _same part of\nspace_ there is now _one thing_ and then _another_, and at _one_ and the\nsame point of time there is _here_ one thing and there _another_: only\nthis reciprocal limitation of space and time by each other gives meaning,\nand at the same time necessity, to a law, according to which change must\ntake place. What is determined by the law of causality is therefore not\nmerely a succession of things in time, but this succession with reference\nto a definite space, and not merely existence of things in a particular\nplace, but in this place at a different point of time. Change, _i.e._,\nvariation which takes place according to the law of causality, implies\nalways a determined part of space and a determined part of time together\nand in union. Thus causality unites space with time. But we found that the\nwhole essence of matter consisted in action, _i.e._, in causation,\nconsequently space and time must also be united in matter, that is to say,\nmatter must take to itself at once the distinguishing qualities both of\nspace and time, however much these may be opposed to each other, and must\nunite in itself what is impossible for each of these independently, that\nis, the fleeting course of time, with the rigid unchangeable perduration\nof space: infinite divisibility it receives from both. It is for this\nreason that we find that co-existence, which could neither be in time\nalone, for time has no contiguity, nor in space alone, for space has no\nbefore, after, or now, is first established through matter. But the\nco-existence of many things constitutes, in fact, the essence of reality,\nfor through it permanence first becomes possible; for permanence is only\nknowable in the change of something which is present along with what is\npermanent, while on the other hand it is only because something permanent\nis present along with what changes, that the latter gains the special\ncharacter of change, _i.e._, the mutation of quality and form in the\npermanence of substance, that is to say, in matter.(7) If the world were\nin space alone, it would be rigid and immovable, without succession,\nwithout change, without action; but we know that with action, the idea of\nmatter first appears. Again, if the world were in time alone, all would be\nfleeting, without persistence, without contiguity, hence without\nco-existence, and consequently without permanence; so that in this case\nalso there would be no matter. Only through the union of space and time do\nwe reach matter, and matter is the possibility of co-existence, and,\nthrough that, of permanence; through permanence again matter is the\npossibility of the persistence of substance in the change of its\nstates.(8) As matter consists in the union of space and time, it bears\nthroughout the stamp of both. It manifests its origin in space, partly\nthrough the form which is inseparable from it, but especially through its\npersistence (substance), the _a priori_ certainty of which is therefore\nwholly deducible from that of space(9) (for variation belongs to time\nalone, but in it alone and for itself nothing is persistent). Matter shows\nthat it springs from time by quality (accidents), without which it never\nexists, and which is plainly always causality, action upon other matter,\nand therefore change (a time concept). The law of this action, however,\nalways depends upon space and time together, and only thus obtains\nmeaning. The regulative function of causality is confined entirely to the\ndetermination of what must occupy _this time and this space_. The fact\nthat we know _a priori_ the unalterable characteristics of matter, depends\nupon this derivation of its essential nature from the forms of our\nknowledge of which we are conscious _a priori_. These unalterable\ncharacteristics are space-occupation, _i.e._, impenetrability, _i.e._,\ncausal action, consequently, extension, infinite divisibility,\npersistence, _i.e._, indestructibility, and lastly mobility: weight, on\nthe other hand, notwithstanding its universality, must be attributed to _a\nposteriori_ knowledge, although Kant, in his “Metaphysical Introduction to\nNatural Philosophy,” p. 71 (p. 372 of Rosenkranz’s edition), treats it as\nknowable _a priori_.\n\nBut as the object in general is only for the subject, as its idea, so\nevery special class of ideas is only for an equally special quality in the\nsubject, which is called a faculty of perception. This subjective\ncorrelative of time and space in themselves as empty forms, has been named\nby Kant pure sensibility; and we may retain this expression, as Kant was\nthe first to treat of the subject, though it is not exact, for sensibility\npresupposes matter. The subjective correlative of matter or of causation,\nfor these two are the same, is understanding, which is nothing more than\nthis. To know causality is its one function, its only power; and it is a\ngreat one, embracing much, of manifold application, yet of unmistakable\nidentity in all its manifestations. Conversely all causation, that is to\nsay, all matter, or the whole of reality, is only for the understanding,\nthrough the understanding, and in the understanding. The first, simplest,\nand ever-present example of understanding is the perception of the actual\nworld. This is throughout knowledge of the cause from the effect, and\ntherefore all perception is intellectual. The understanding could never\narrive at this perception, however, if some effect did not become known\nimmediately, and thus serve as a starting-point. But this is the affection\nof the animal body. So far, then, the animal body is the _immediate\nobject_ of the subject; the perception of all other objects becomes\npossible through it. The changes which every animal body experiences, are\nimmediately known, that is, felt; and as these effects are at once\nreferred to their causes, the perception of the latter as _objects_\narises. This relation is no conclusion in abstract conceptions; it does\nnot arise from reflection, nor is it arbitrary, but immediate, necessary,\nand certain. It is the method of knowing of the pure understanding,\nwithout which there could be no perception; there would only remain a dull\nplant-like consciousness of the changes of the immediate object, which\nwould succeed each other in an utterly unmeaning way, except in so far as\nthey might have a meaning for the will either as pain or pleasure. But as\nwith the rising of the sun the visible world appears, so at one stroke,\nthe understanding, by means of its one simple function, changes the dull,\nmeaningless sensation into perception. What the eye, the ear, or the hand\nfeels, is not perception; it is merely its data. By the understanding\npassing from the effect to the cause, the world first appears as\nperception extended in space, varying in respect of form, persistent\nthrough all time in respect of matter; for the understanding unites space\nand time in the idea of matter, that is, causal action. As the world as\nidea exists only through the understanding, so also it exists only for the\nunderstanding. In the first chapter of my essay on “Light and Colour,” I\nhave already explained how the understanding constructs perceptions out of\nthe data supplied by the senses; how by comparison of the impressions\nwhich the various senses receive from the object, a child arrives at\nperceptions; how this alone affords the solution of so many phenomena of\nthe senses; the single vision of two eyes, the double vision in the case\nof a squint, or when we try to look at once at objects which lie at\nunequal distances behind each other; and all illusion which is produced by\na sudden alteration in the organs of sense. But I have treated this\nimportant subject much more fully and thoroughly in the second edition of\nthe essay on “The Principle of Sufficient Reason,”",

The\ncontrary doctrine that the law of causality results from experience, which\nwas the scepticism of Hume, is first refuted by this.

    "page_content": "everything that lives and knows, though man alone can bring it into\nreflective and abstract consciousness. If he really does this, he has\nattained to philosophical wisdom. It then becomes clear and certain to him\nthat what he knows is not a sun and an earth, but only an eye that sees a\nsun, a hand that feels an earth; that the world which surrounds him is\nthere only as idea, _i.e._, only in relation to something else, the\nconsciousness, which is himself. If any truth can be asserted _a priori_,\nit is this: for it is the expression of the most general form of all\npossible and thinkable experience: a form which is more general than time,\nor space, or causality, for they all presuppose it; and each of these,\nwhich we have seen to be just so many modes of the principle of sufficient\nreason, is valid only for a particular class of ideas; whereas the\nantithesis of object and subject is the common form of all these classes,\nis that form under which alone any idea of whatever kind it may be,\nabstract or intuitive, pure or empirical, is possible and thinkable. No\ntruth therefore is more certain, more independent of all others, and less\nin need of proof than this, that all that exists for knowledge, and\ntherefore this whole world, is only object in relation to subject,\nperception of a perceiver, in a word, idea. This is obviously true of the\npast and the future, as well as of the present, of what is farthest off,\nas of what is near; for it is true of time and space themselves, in which\nalone these distinctions arise. All that in any way belongs or can belong\nto the world is inevitably thus conditioned through the subject, and\nexists only for the subject. The world is idea.\n\nThis truth is by no means new. It was implicitly involved in the sceptical\nreflections from which Descartes started. Berkeley, however, was the first\nwho distinctly enunciated it, and by this he has rendered a permanent\nservice to philosophy, even though the rest of his teaching should not\nendure. Kant’s primary mistake was the neglect of this principle, as is\nshown in the appendix. How early again this truth was recognised by the\nwise men of India, appearing indeed as the fundamental tenet of the\nVedânta philosophy ascribed to Vyasa, is pointed out by Sir William Jones\nin the last of his essays: “On the philosophy of the Asiatics” (Asiatic\nResearches, vol. iv. p. 164), where he says, “The fundamental tenet of the\nVedanta school consisted not in denying the existence of matter, that is,\nof solidity, impenetrability, and extended figure (to deny which would be\nlunacy), but in correcting the popular notion of it, and in contending\nthat it has no essence independent of mental perception; that existence\nand perceptibility are convertible terms.” These words adequately express\nthe compatibility of empirical reality and transcendental ideality.\n\nIn this first book, then, we consider the world only from this side, only\nso far as it is idea. The inward reluctance with which any one accepts the\nworld as merely his idea, warns him that this view of it, however true it\nmay be, is nevertheless one-sided, adopted in consequence of some\narbitrary abstraction. And yet it is a conception from which he can never\nfree himself. The defectiveness of this view will be corrected in the next\nbook by means of a truth which is not so immediately certain as that from\nwhich we start here; a truth at which we can arrive only by deeper\nresearch and more severe abstraction, by the separation of what is\ndifferent and the union of what is identical. This truth, which must be\nvery serious and impressive if not awful to every one, is that a man can\nalso say and must say, “the world is my will.”\n\nIn this book, however, we must consider separately that aspect of the\nworld from which we start, its aspect as knowable, and therefore, in the\nmeantime, we must, without reserve, regard all presented objects, even our\nown bodies (as we shall presently show more fully), merely as ideas, and\ncall them merely ideas. By so doing we always abstract from will (as we\nhope to make clear to every one further on), which by itself constitutes\nthe other aspect of the world. For as the world is in one aspect entirely\n_idea_, so in another it is entirely _will_. A reality which is neither of\nthese two, but an object in itself (into which the thing in itself has\nunfortunately dwindled in the hands of Kant), is the phantom of a dream,\nand its acceptance is an _ignis fatuus_ in philosophy.",

    "page_content": "perception and abstract ideas. The latter form just one class of ideas,\nnamely concepts, and these are the possession of man alone of all\ncreatures upon earth. The capacity for these, which distinguishes him from\nall the lower animals, has always been called reason.(5) We shall consider\nthese abstract ideas by themselves later, but, in the first place, we\nshall speak exclusively of the _ideas of perception_. These comprehend the\nwhole visible world, or the sum total of experience, with the conditions\nof its possibility. We have already observed that it is a highly important\ndiscovery of Kant’s, that these very conditions, these forms of the\nvisible world, _i.e._, the absolutely universal element in its perception,\nthe common property of all its phenomena, space and time, even when taken\nby themselves and apart from their content, can, not only be thought in\nthe abstract, but also be directly perceived; and that this perception or\nintuition is not some kind of phantasm arising from constant recurrence in\nexperience, but is so entirely independent of experience that we must\nrather regard the latter as dependent on it, inasmuch as the qualities of\nspace and time, as they are known in _a priori_ perception or intuition,\nare valid for all possible experience, as rules to which it must\ninvariably conform. Accordingly, in my essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason, I have treated space and time, because they are\nperceived as pure and empty of content, as a special and independent class\nof ideas. This quality of the universal forms of intuition, which was\ndiscovered by Kant, that they may be perceived in themselves and apart\nfrom experience, and that they may be known as exhibiting those laws on\nwhich is founded the infallible science of mathematics, is certainly very\nimportant. Not less worthy of remark, however, is this other quality of\ntime and space, that the principle of sufficient reason, which conditions\nexperience as the law of causation and of motive, and thought as the law\nof the basis of judgment, appears here in quite a special form, to which I\nhave given the name of the ground of being. In time, this is the\nsuccession of its moments, and in space the position of its parts, which\nreciprocally determine each other _ad infinitum_.\n\nAny one who has fully understood from the introductory essay the complete\nidentity of the content of the principle of sufficient reason in all its\ndifferent forms, must also be convinced of the importance of the knowledge\nof the simplest of these forms, as affording him insight into his own\ninmost nature. This simplest form of the principle we have found to be\ntime. In it each instant is, only in so far as it has effaced the\npreceding one, its generator, to be itself in turn as quickly effaced. The\npast and the future (considered apart from the consequences of their\ncontent) are empty as a dream, and the present is only the indivisible and\nunenduring boundary between them. And in all the other forms of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, we shall find the same emptiness, and\nshall see that not time only but also space, and the whole content of both\nof them, _i.e._, all that proceeds from causes and motives, has a merely\nrelative existence, is only through and for another like to itself,\n_i.e._, not more enduring. The substance of this doctrine is old: it\nappears in Heraclitus when he laments the eternal flux of things; in Plato\nwhen he degrades the object to that which is ever becoming, but never\nbeing; in Spinoza as the doctrine of the mere accidents of the one\nsubstance which is and endures. Kant opposes what is thus known as the\nmere phenomenon to the thing in itself. Lastly, the ancient wisdom of the\nIndian philosophers declares, “It is Mâyâ, the veil of deception, which\nblinds the eyes of mortals, and makes them behold a world of which they\ncannot say either that it is or that it is not: for it is like a dream; it\nis like the sunshine on the sand which the traveller takes from afar for\nwater, or the stray piece of rope he mistakes for a snake.” (These similes\nare repeated in innumerable passages of the Vedas and the Puranas.) But\nwhat all these mean, and that of which they all speak, is nothing more\nthan what we have just considered—the world as idea subject to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason.",

    "page_content": "merely as idea, as object for the subject. And our own body, which is the\nstarting-point for each of us in our perception of the world, we consider,\nlike all other real objects, from the side of its knowableness, and in\nthis regard it is simply an idea. Now the consciousness of every one is in\ngeneral opposed to the explanation of objects as mere ideas, and more\nespecially to the explanation of our bodies as such; for the thing in\nitself is known to each of us immediately in so far as it appears as our\nown body; but in so far as it objectifies itself in the other objects of\nperception, it is known only indirectly. But this abstraction, this\none-sided treatment, this forcible separation of what is essentially and\nnecessarily united, is only adopted to meet the demands of our argument;\nand therefore the disinclination to it must, in the meantime, be\nsuppressed and silenced by the expectation that the subsequent treatment\nwill correct the one-sidedness of the present one, and complete our\nknowledge of the nature of the world.\n\nAt present therefore the body is for us immediate object; that is to say,\nthat idea which forms the starting-point of the subject’s knowledge;\nbecause the body, with its immediately known changes, precedes the\napplication of the law of causality, and thus supplies it with its first\ndata. The whole nature of matter consists, as we have seen, in its causal\naction. But cause and effect exist only for the understanding, which is\nnothing but their subjective correlative. The understanding, however,\ncould never come into operation if there were not something else from\nwhich it starts. This is simple sensation—the immediate consciousness of\nthe changes of the body, by virtue of which it is immediate object. Thus\nthe possibility of knowing the world of perception depends upon two\nconditions; the first, _objectively expressed_, is the power of material\nthings to act upon each other, to produce changes in each other, without\nwhich common quality of all bodies no perception would be possible, even\nby means of the sensibility of the animal body. And if we wish to express\nthis condition _subjectively_ we say: The understanding first makes\nperception possible; for the law of causality, the possibility of effect\nand cause, springs only from the understanding, and is valid only for it,\nand therefore the world of perception exists only through and for it. The\nsecond condition is the sensibility of animal bodies, or the quality of\nbeing immediate objects of the subject which certain bodies possess. The\nmere modification which the organs of sense sustain from without through\ntheir specific affections, may here be called ideas, so far as these\naffections produce neither pain nor pleasure, that is, have no immediate\nsignificance for the will, and are yet perceived, exist therefore only for\n_knowledge_. Thus far, then, I say that the body is immediately _known_,\nis _immediate object_. But the conception of object is not to be taken\nhere in its fullest sense, for through this immediate knowledge of the\nbody, which precedes the operation of the understanding, and is mere\nsensation, our own body does not exist specifically as _object_, but first\nthe material things which affect it: for all knowledge of an object\nproper, of an idea perceived in space, exists only through and for the\nunderstanding; therefore not before, but only subsequently to its\noperation. Therefore the body as object proper, that is, as an idea\nperceived in space, is first known indirectly, like all other objects,\nthrough the application of the law of causality to the action of one of\nits parts upon another, as, for example, when the eye sees the body or the\nhand touches it. Consequently the form of our body does not become known\nto us through mere feeling, but only through knowledge, only in idea; that\nis to say, only in the brain does our own body first come to appear as\nextended, articulate, organic. A man born blind receives this idea only\nlittle by little from the data afforded by touch. A blind man without\nhands could never come to know his own form; or at the most could infer\nand construct it little by little from the effects of other bodies upon\nhim. If, then, we call the body an immediate object, we are to be\nunderstood with these reservations.\n\nIn other respects, then, according to what has been said, all animal\nbodies are immediate objects; that is, starting-points for the subject\nwhich always knows and therefore is never known in its perception of the\nworld. Thus the distinctive characteristic of animal life is knowledge,\nwith movement following on motives, which are determined by knowledge,\njust as movement following on stimuli is the distinctive characteristic of\nplant-life. Unorganised matter, however, has no movement except such as is\nproduced by causes properly so called, using the term in its narrowest\nsense. All this I have thoroughly discussed in my essay on the principle\nof sufficient reason, § 20, in the “Ethics,” first essay, iii., and in my\nwork on Sight and Colour, § 1, to which I therefore refer.\n\nIt follows from what has been said, that all animals, even the least\ndeveloped, have understanding; for they all know objects, and this\nknowledge determines their movements as motive. Understanding is the same\nin all animals and in all men; it has everywhere the same simple form;\nknowledge of causality, transition from effect to cause, and from cause to\neffect, nothing more; but the degree of its acuteness, and the extension\nof the sphere of its knowledge varies enormously, with innumerable\ngradations from the lowest form, which is only conscious of the causal\nconnection between the immediate object and objects affecting it—that is\nto say, perceives a cause as an object in space by passing to it from the\naffection which the body feels, to the higher grades of knowledge of the\ncausal connection among objects known indirectly, which extends to the\nunderstanding of the most complicated system of cause and effect in\nnature. For even this high degree of knowledge is still the work of the\nunderstanding, not of the reason. The abstract concepts of the reason can\nonly serve to take up the objective connections which are immediately\nknown by the understanding, to make them permanent for thought, and to\nrelate them to each other; but reason never gives us immediate knowledge.\nEvery force and law of nature, every example of such forces and laws, must\nfirst be immediately known by the understanding, must be apprehended\nthrough perception before it can pass into abstract consciousness for\nreason. Hooke’s discovery of the law of gravitation, and the reference of\nso many important phenomena to this one law, was the work of immediate\napprehension by the understanding; and such also was the proof of Newton’s\ncalculations, and Lavoisier’s discovery of acids and their important\nfunction in nature, and also Goethe’s discovery of the origin of physical\ncolours. All these discoveries are nothing more than a correct immediate\npassage from the effect to the cause, which is at once followed by the\nrecognition of the ideality of the force of nature which expresses itself\nin all causes of the same kind; and this complete insight is just an\nexample of that single function of the understanding, by which an animal\nperceives as an object in space the cause which affects its body, and\ndiffers from such a perception only in degree. Every one of these great\ndiscoveries is therefore, just like perception, an operation of the\nunderstanding, an immediate intuition, and as such the work of an instant,\nan _apperçu_, a flash of insight. They are not the result of a process of\nabstract reasoning, which only serves to make the immediate knowledge of\nthe understanding permanent for thought by bringing it under abstract\nconcepts, _i.e._, it makes knowledge distinct, it puts us in a position to\nimpart it and explain it to others. The keenness of the understanding in\napprehending the causal relations of objects which are known indirectly,\ndoes not find its only application in the sphere of natural science\n(though all the discoveries in that sphere are due to it), but it also\nappears in practical life. It is then called good sense or prudence, as in\nits other application it is better called acuteness, penetration,\nsagacity. More exactly, good sense or prudence signifies exclusively\nunderstanding at the command of the will. But the limits of these\nconceptions must not be too sharply defined, for it is always that one\nfunction of the understanding by means of which all animals perceive\nobjects in space, which, in its keenest form, appears now in the phenomena\nof nature, correctly inferring the unknown causes from the given effects,\nand providing the material from which the reason frames general rules as\nlaws of nature; now inventing complicated and ingenious machines by\nadapting known causes to desired effects; now in the sphere of motives,\nseeing through and frustrating intrigues and machinations, or fitly\ndisposing the motives and the men who are susceptible to them, setting\nthem in motion, as machines are moved by levers and wheels, and directing\nthem at will to the accomplishment of its ends. Deficiency of\nunderstanding is called _stupidity_. It is just _dulness in applying the\nlaw of causality_, incapacity for the immediate apprehension of the\nconcatenations of causes and effects, motives and actions. A stupid person\nhas no insight into the connection of natural phenomena, either when they\nfollow their own course, or when they are intentionally combined, _i.e._,\nare applied to machinery. Such a man readily believes in magic and\nmiracles. A stupid man does not observe that persons, who apparently act\nindependently of each other, are really in collusion; he is therefore\neasily mystified, and outwitted; he does not discern the hidden motives of\nproffered advice or expressions of opinion, &c. But it is always just one\nthing that he lacks—keenness, rapidity, ease in applying the law of\ncausality, _i.e._, power of understanding. The greatest, and, in this\nreference, the most instructive example of stupidity I ever met with, was\nthe case of a totally imbecile boy of about eleven years of age, in an\nasylum. He had reason, because he spoke and comprehended, but in respect\nof understanding he was inferior to many of the lower animals. Whenever I\nvisited him he noticed an eye-glass which I wore round my neck, and in\nwhich the window of the room and the tops of the trees beyond were\nreflected: on every occasion he was greatly surprised and delighted with\nthis, and was never tired of looking at it with astonishment, because he\ndid not understand the immediate causation of reflection.\n\nWhile the difference in degree of the acuteness of the understanding, is\nvery great between man and man, it is even greater between one species of\nanimal and another. In all species of animals, even those which are\nnearest to plants, there is at least as much understanding as suffices for\nthe inference from the effect on the immediate object, to the indirectly\nknown object as its cause, _i.e._, sufficient for perception, for the\napprehension of an object. For it is this that constitutes them animals,\nas it gives them the power of movement following on motives, and thereby\nthe power of seeking for food, or at least of seizing it; whereas plants\nhave only movement following on stimuli, whose direct influence they must\nawait, or else decay, for they cannot seek after them nor appropriate\nthem. We marvel at the great sagacity of the most developed species of\nanimals, such as the dog, the elephant, the monkey or the fox, whose\ncleverness has been so admirably sketched by Buffon. From these most\nsagacious animals, we can pretty accurately determine how far\nunderstanding can go without reason, _i.e._, abstract knowledge embodied\nin concepts. We could not find this out from ourselves, for in us\nunderstanding and reason always reciprocally support each other. We find\nthat the manifestation of understanding in animals is sometimes above our\nexpectation, and sometimes below it. On the one hand, we are surprised at\nthe sagacity of the elephant, who, after crossing many bridges during his\njourney in Europe, once refused to go upon one, because he thought it was\nnot strong enough to bear his weight, though he saw the rest of the party,\nconsisting of men and horses, go upon it as usual. On the other hand, we\nwonder that the intelligent Orang-outangs, who warm themselves at a fire\nthey have found, do not keep it alight by throwing wood on it; a proof\nthat this requires a deliberation which is not possible without abstract\nconcepts. It is clear that the knowledge of cause and effect, as the\nuniversal form of understanding, belongs to all animals _a priori_,\nbecause to them as to us it is the prior condition of all perception of\nthe outer world. If any one desires additional proof of this, let him\nobserve, for example, how a young dog is afraid to jump down from a table,\nhowever much he may wish to do so, because he foresees the effect of the\nweight of his body, though he has not been taught this by experience. In\njudging of the understanding of animals, we must guard against ascribing\nto it the manifestations of instinct, a faculty which is quite distinct\nboth from understanding and reason, but the action of which is often very\nanalogous to the combined action of the two. We cannot, however, discuss\nthis here; it will find its proper place in the second book, when we\nconsider the harmony or so-called teleology of nature: and the 27th\nchapter of the supplementary volume is expressly devoted to it.\n\nDeficiency of _understanding_ we call _stupidity_: deficiency in the\napplication of _reason_ to practice we shall recognise later as\n_foolishness_: deficiency of judgment as _silliness_, and lastly, partial\nor entire deficiency of _memory_ as _madness_. But each of these will be\nconsidered in its own place. That which is correctly known by _reason_ is\n_truth_, that is, an abstract judgment on sufficient grounds (Essay on the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason, § 29 and following paragraphs); that which\nis correctly known by _understanding_ is _reality_, that is correct\ninference from effect on the immediate object to its cause. _Error_ is\nopposed to _truth_, as deception of the _reason_: _illusion_ is opposed to\n_reality_, as deception of the _understanding_. The full discussion of all\nthis will be found in the first chapter of my essay on Light and Colour.\nIllusion takes place when the same effect may be attributed to two causes,\nof which one occurs very frequently, the other very seldom; the\nunderstanding having no data to decide which of these two causes operates\nin any particular case,—for their effects are exactly alike,—always\nassumes the presence of the commoner cause, and as the activity of the\nunderstanding is not reflective and discursive, but direct and immediate,\nthis false cause appears before us as a perceived object, whereas it is\nmerely illusion. I have explained in the essay referred to, how in this\nway double sight and double feeling take place if the organs of sense are\nbrought into an unusual position; and have thus given an incontrovertible\nproof that perception exists only through and for the understanding. As\nadditional examples of such illusions or deceptions of the understanding,\nwe may mention the broken appearance of a stick dipped in water; the\nreflections in spherical mirrors, which, when the surface is convex appear\nsomewhat behind it, and when the surface is concave appear a long way in\nfront of it. To this class also belongs the apparently greater extension\nof the moon at the horizon than at the zenith. This appearance is not\noptical, for as the micrometre proves, the eye receives the image of the\nmoon at the zenith, at an even greater angle of vision than at the\nhorizon. The mistake is due to the understanding, which assumes that the\ncause of the feebler light of the moon and of all stars at the horizon is\nthat they are further off, thus treating them as earthly objects,\naccording to the laws of atmospheric perspective, and therefore it takes\nthe moon to be much larger at the horizon than at the zenith, and also\nregards the vault of heaven as more extended or flattened out at the\nhorizon. The same false application of the laws of atmospheric perspective\nleads us to suppose that very high mountains, whose summits alone are\nvisible in pure transparent air, are much nearer than they really are, and\ntherefore not so high as they are; for example, Mont Blanc seen from\nSalenche. All such illusions are immediately present to us as perceptions,\nand cannot be dispelled by any arguments of the reason. Reason can only\nprevent error, that is, a judgment on insufficient grounds, by opposing to\nit a truth; as for example, the abstract knowledge that the cause of the\nweaker light of the moon and the stars at the horizon is not greater\ndistance, but the denser atmosphere; but in all the cases we have referred\nto, the illusion remains in spite of every abstract explanation. For the\nunderstanding is in itself, even in the case of man, irrational, and is\ncompletely and sharply distinguished from the reason, which is a faculty\nof knowledge that belongs to man alone. The reason can only _know_;\nperception remains free from its influence and belongs to the\nunderstanding alone.",

    "page_content": "observed that we did not start either from the object or the subject, but\nfrom the idea, which contains and presupposes them both; for the\nantithesis of object and subject is its primary, universal and essential\nform. We have therefore first considered this form as such; then (though\nin this respect reference has for the most part been made to the\nintroductory essay) the subordinate forms of time, space and causality.\nThe latter belong exclusively to the _object_, and yet, as they are\nessential to the object _as such_, and as the object again is essential to\nthe subject _as such_, they may be discovered from the subject, _i.e._,\nthey may be known _a priori_, and so far they are to be regarded as the\ncommon limits of both. But all these forms may be referred to one general\nexpression, the principle of sufficient reason, as we have explained in\nthe introductory essay.\n\nThis procedure distinguishes our philosophical method from that of all\nformer systems. For they all start either from the object or from the\nsubject, and therefore seek to explain the one from the other, and this\naccording to the principle of sufficient reason. We, on the contrary, deny\nthe validity of this principle with reference to the relation of subject\nand object, and confine it to the object. It may be thought that the\nphilosophy of identity, which has appeared and become generally known in\nour own day, does not come under either of the alternatives we have named,\nfor it does not start either from the subject or from the object, but from\nthe absolute, known through “intellectual intuition,” which is neither\nobject nor subject, but the identity of the two. I will not venture to\nspeak of this revered identity, and this absolute, for I find myself\nentirely devoid of all “intellectual intuition.” But as I take my stand\nmerely on those manifestoes of the “intellectual intuiter” which are open\nto all, even to profane persons like myself, I must yet observe that this\nphilosophy is not to be excepted from the alternative errors mentioned\nabove. For it does not escape these two opposite errors in spite of its\nidentity of subject and object, which is not thinkable, but only\n“intellectually intuitable,” or to be experienced by a losing of oneself\nin it. On the contrary, it combines them both in itself; for it is divided\ninto two parts, firstly, transcendental idealism, which is just Fichte’s\ndoctrine of the _ego_, and therefore teaches that the object is produced\nby the subject, or evolved out of it in accordance with the principle of\nsufficient reason; secondly, the philosophy of nature, which teaches that\nthe subject is produced little by little from the object, by means of a\nmethod called construction, about which I understand very little, yet\nenough to know that it is a process according to various forms of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. The deep wisdom itself which that\nconstruction contains, I renounce; for as I entirely lack “intellectual\nintuition,” all those expositions which presuppose it must for me remain\nas a book sealed with seven seals. This is so truly the case that, strange\nto say, I have always been unable to find anything at all in this doctrine\nof profound wisdom but atrocious and wearisome bombast.\n\nThe systems starting from the object had always the whole world of\nperception and its constitution as their problem; yet the object which\nthey take as their starting-point is not always this whole world of\nperception, nor its fundamental element, matter. On the contrary, a\ndivision of these systems may be made, based on the four classes of\npossible objects set forth in the introductory essay. Thus Thales and the\nIonic school, Democritus, Epicurus, Giordano Bruno, and the French\nmaterialists, may be said to have started from the first class of objects,\nthe real world: Spinoza (on account of his conception of substance, which\nis purely abstract, and exists only in his definition) and, earlier, the\nEleatics, from the second class, the abstract conception: the Pythagoreans\nand Chinese philosophy in Y-King, from the third class, time, and\nconsequently number: and, lastly, the schoolmen, who teach a creation out\nof nothing by the act of will of an extra-mundane personal being, started\nfrom the fourth class of objects, the act of will directed by knowledge.\n\nOf all systems of philosophy which start from the object, the most\nconsistent, and that which may be carried furthest, is simple materialism.\nIt regards matter, and with it time and space, as existing absolutely, and\nignores the relation to the subject in which alone all this really exists.\nIt then lays hold of the law of causality as a guiding principle or clue,\nregarding it as a self-existent order (or arrangement) of things, _veritas\naeterna_, and so fails to take account of the understanding, in which and\nfor which alone causality is. It seeks the primary and most simple state\nof matter, and then tries to develop all the others from it; ascending\nfrom mere mechanism, to chemism, to polarity, to the vegetable and to the\nanimal kingdom. And if we suppose this to have been done, the last link in\nthe chain would be animal sensibility—that is knowledge—which would\nconsequently now appear as a mere modification or state of matter produced\nby causality. Now if we had followed materialism thus far with clear\nideas, when we reached its highest point we would suddenly be seized with\na fit of the inextinguishable laughter of the Olympians. As if waking from\na dream, we would all at once become aware that its final\nresult—knowledge, which it reached so laboriously, was presupposed as the\nindispensable condition of its very starting-point, mere matter; and when\nwe imagined that we thought matter, we really thought only the subject\nthat perceives matter; the eye that sees it, the hand that feels it, the\nunderstanding that knows it. Thus the tremendous _petitio principii_\nreveals itself unexpectedly; for suddenly the last link is seen to be the\nstarting-point, the chain a circle, and the materialist is like Baron\nMünchausen who, when swimming in water on horseback, drew the horse into\nthe air with his legs, and himself also by his cue. The fundamental\nabsurdity of materialism is that it starts from the _objective_, and takes\nas the ultimate ground of explanation something _objective_, whether it be\nmatter in the abstract, simply as it is _thought_, or after it has taken\nform, is empirically given—that is to say, is _substance_, the chemical\nelement with its primary relations. Some such thing it takes, as existing\nabsolutely and in itself, in order that it may evolve organic nature and\nfinally the knowing subject from it, and explain them adequately by means\nof it; whereas in truth all that is objective is already determined as\nsuch in manifold ways by the knowing subject through its forms of knowing,\nand presupposes them; and consequently it entirely disappears if we think\nthe subject away. Thus materialism is the attempt to explain what is\nimmediately given us by what is given us indirectly. All that is\nobjective, extended, active—that is to say, all that is material—is\nregarded by materialism as affording so solid a basis for its explanation,\nthat a reduction of everything to this can leave nothing to be desired\n(especially if in ultimate analysis this reduction should resolve itself\ninto action and reaction). But we have shown that all this is given\nindirectly and in the highest degree determined, and is therefore merely a\nrelatively present object, for it has passed through the machinery and\nmanufactory of the brain, and has thus come under the forms of space, time\nand causality, by means of which it is first presented to us as extended\nin space and ever active in time. From such an indirectly given object,\nmaterialism seeks to explain what is immediately given, the idea (in which\nalone the object that materialism starts with exists), and finally even\nthe will from which all those fundamental forces, that manifest\nthemselves, under the guidance of causes, and therefore according to law,\nare in truth to be explained. To the assertion that thought is a\nmodification of matter we may always, with equal right, oppose the\ncontrary assertion that all matter is merely the modification of the\nknowing subject, as its idea. Yet the aim and ideal of all natural science\nis at bottom a consistent materialism. The recognition here of the obvious\nimpossibility of such a system establishes another truth which will appear\nin the course of our exposition, the truth that all science properly so\ncalled, by which I understand systematic knowledge under the guidance of\nthe principle of sufficient reason, can never reach its final goal, nor\ngive a complete and adequate explanation: for it is not concerned with the\ninmost nature of the world, it cannot get beyond the idea; indeed, it\nreally teaches nothing more than the relation of one idea to another.\n\nEvery science must start from two principal data. One of these is always\nthe principle of sufficient reason in some form or another, as organon;\nthe other is its special object as problem. Thus, for example, geometry\nhas space as problem, and the ground of existence in space as organon.\nArithmetic has time as problem, and the ground of existence in time as\norganon. Logic has the combination of concepts as such as problem, and the\nground of knowledge as organon. History has the past acts of men treated\nas a whole as problem, and the law of human motives as organon. Natural\nscience has matter as problem, and the law of causality as organon. Its\nend and aim is therefore, by the guidance of causality, to refer all\npossible states of matter to other states, and ultimately to one single\nstate; and again to deduce these states from each other, and ultimately\nfrom one single state. Thus two states of matter stand over against each\nother in natural science as extremes: that state in which matter is\nfurthest from being the immediate object of the subject, and that state in\nwhich it is most completely such an immediate object, _i.e._, the most\ndead and crude matter, the primary element, as the one extreme, and the\nhuman organism as the other. Natural science as chemistry seeks for the\nfirst, as physiology for the second. But as yet neither extreme has been\nreached, and it is only in the intermediate ground that something has been\nwon. The prospect is indeed somewhat hopeless. The chemists, under the\npresupposition that the qualitative division of matter is not, like\nquantitative division, an endless process, are always trying to decrease\nthe number of the elements, of which there are still about sixty; and if\nthey were to succeed in reducing them to two, they would still try to find\nthe common root of these. For, on the one hand, the law of homogeneity\nleads to the assumption of a primary chemical state of matter, which alone\nbelongs to matter as such, and precedes all others which are not\nessentially matter as such, but merely contingent forms and qualities. On\nthe other hand, we cannot understand how this one state could ever\nexperience a chemical change, if there did not exist a second state to\naffect it. Thus the same difficulty appears in chemistry which Epicurus\nmet with in mechanics. For he had to show how the first atom departed from\nthe original direction of its motion. Indeed this contradiction, which\ndevelops entirely of itself and can neither be escaped nor solved, might\nquite properly be set up as a chemical _antinomy_. Thus an antinomy\nappears in the one extreme of natural science, and a corresponding one\nwill appear in the other. There is just as little hope of reaching this\nopposite extreme of natural science, for we see ever more clearly that\nwhat is chemical can never be referred to what is mechanical, nor what is\norganic to what is chemical or electrical. Those who in our own day are\nentering anew on this old, misleading path, will soon slink back silent\nand ashamed, as all their predecessors have done before them. We shall\nconsider this more fully in the second book. Natural science encounters\nthe difficulties which we have cursorily mentioned, in its own province.\nRegarded as philosophy, it would further be materialism; but this, as we\nhave seen, even at its birth, has death in its heart, because it ignores\nthe subject and the forms of knowledge, which are presupposed, just as\nmuch in the case of the crudest matter, from which it desires to start, as\nin that of the organism, at which it desires to arrive. For, “no object\nwithout a subject,” is the principle which renders all materialism for\never impossible. Suns and planets without an eye that sees them, and an\nunderstanding that knows them, may indeed be spoken of in words, but for\nthe idea, these words are absolutely meaningless. On the other hand, the\nlaw of causality and the treatment and investigation of nature which is\nbased upon it, lead us necessarily to the conclusion that, in time, each\nmore highly organised state of matter has succeeded a cruder state: so\nthat the lower animals existed before men, fishes before land animals,\nplants before fishes, and the unorganised before all that is organised;\nthat, consequently, the original mass had to pass through a long series of\nchanges before the first eye could be opened. And yet, the existence of\nthis whole world remains ever dependent upon the first eye that opened,\neven if it were that of an insect. For such an eye is a necessary\ncondition of the possibility of knowledge, and the whole world exists only\nin and for knowledge, and without it is not even thinkable. The world is\nentirely idea, and as such demands the knowing subject as the supporter of\nits existence. This long course of time itself, filled with innumerable\nchanges, through which matter rose from form to form till at last the\nfirst percipient creature appeared,—this whole time itself is only\nthinkable in the identity of a consciousness whose succession of ideas,\nwhose form of knowing it is, and apart from which, it loses all meaning\nand is nothing at all. Thus we see, on the one hand, the existence of the\nwhole world necessarily dependent upon the first conscious being, however\nundeveloped it may be; on the other hand, this conscious being just as\nnecessarily entirely dependent upon a long chain of causes and effects\nwhich have preceded it, and in which it itself appears as a small link.\nThese two contradictory points of view, to each of which we are led with\nthe same necessity, we might again call an _antinomy_ in our faculty of\nknowledge, and set it up as the counterpart of that which we found in the\nfirst extreme of natural science. The fourfold antinomy of Kant will be\nshown, in the criticism of his philosophy appended to this volume, to be a\ngroundless delusion. But the necessary contradiction which at last\npresents itself to us here, finds its solution in the fact that, to use\nKant’s phraseology, time, space, and causality do not belong to the\nthing-in-itself, but only to its phenomena, of which they are the form;\nwhich in my language means this: The objective world, the world as idea,\nis not the only side of the world, but merely its outward side; and it has\nan entirely different side—the side of its inmost nature—its kernel—the\nthing-in-itself. This we shall consider in the second book, calling it\nafter the most immediate of its objective manifestations—will. But the\nworld as idea, with which alone we are here concerned, only appears with\nthe opening of the first eye. Without this medium of knowledge it cannot\nbe, and therefore it was not before it. But without that eye, that is to\nsay, outside of knowledge, there was also no before, no time. Thus time\nhas no beginning, but all beginning is in time. Since, however, it is the\nmost universal form of the knowable, in which all phenomena are united\ntogether through causality, time, with its infinity of past and future, is\npresent in the beginning of knowledge. The phenomenon which fills the\nfirst present must at once be known as causally bound up with and\ndependent upon a sequence of phenomena which stretches infinitely into the\npast, and this past itself is just as truly conditioned by this first\npresent, as conversely the present is by the past. Accordingly the past\nout of which the first present arises, is, like it, dependent upon the\nknowing subject, without which it is nothing. It necessarily happens,\nhowever, that this first present does not manifest itself as the first,\nthat is, as having no past for its parent, but as being the beginning of\ntime. It manifests itself rather as the consequence of the past, according\nto the principle of existence in time. In the same way, the phenomena\nwhich fill this first present appear as the effects of earlier phenomena\nwhich filled the past, in accordance with the law of causality. Those who\nlike mythological interpretations may take the birth of Kronos (χρονος),\nthe youngest of the Titans, as a symbol of the moment here referred to at\nwhich time appears, though, indeed it has no beginning; for with him,\nsince he ate his father, the crude productions of heaven and earth cease,\nand the races of gods and men appear upon the scene.\n\nThis explanation at which we have arrived by following the most consistent\nof the philosophical systems which start from the object, materialism, has\nbrought out clearly the inseparable and reciprocal dependence of subject\nand object, and at the same time the inevitable antithesis between them.\nAnd this knowledge leads us to seek for the inner nature of the world, the\nthing-in-itself, not in either of the two elements of the idea, but in\nsomething quite distinct from it, and which is not encumbered with such a\nfundamental and insoluble antithesis.\n\nOpposed to the system we have explained, which starts from the object in\norder to derive the subject from it, is the system which starts from the\nsubject and tries to derive the object from it. The first of these has\nbeen of frequent and common occurrence throughout the history of\nphilosophy, but of the second we find only one example, and that a very\nrecent one; the “philosophy of appearance” of J. G. Fichte. In this\nrespect, therefore, it must be considered; little real worth or inner\nmeaning as the doctrine itself had. It was indeed for the most part merely\na delusion, but it was delivered with an air of the deepest earnestness,\nwith sustained loftiness of tone and zealous ardour, and was defended with\neloquent polemic against weak opponents, so that it was able to present a\nbrilliant exterior and seemed to be something. But the genuine earnestness\nwhich keeps truth always steadfastly before it as its goal, and is\nunaffected by any external influences, was entirely wanting to Fichte, as\nit is to all philosophers who, like him, concern themselves with questions\nof the day. In his case, indeed, it could not have been otherwise. A man\nbecomes a philosopher by reason of a certain perplexity, from which he\nseeks to free himself. This is Plato’s θαυμαξειν, which he calls a μαλα\nφιλοσοφικον παθος. But what distinguishes the false philosopher from the\ntrue is this: the perplexity of the latter arises from the contemplation\nof the world itself, while that of the former results from some book, some\nsystem of philosophy which is before him. Now Fichte belongs to the class\nof the false philosophers. He was made a philosopher by Kant’s doctrine of\nthe thing-in-itself, and if it had not been for this he would probably\nhave pursued entirely different ends, with far better results, for he\ncertainly possessed remarkable rhetorical talent. If he had only\npenetrated somewhat deeply into the meaning of the book that made him a\nphilosopher, “The Critique of Pure Reason,” he would have understood that\nits principal teaching about mind is this. The principle of sufficient\nreason is not, as all scholastic philosophy maintains, a _veritas\naeterna_—that is to say, it does not possess an unconditioned validity\nbefore, outside of, and above the world. It is relative and conditioned,\nand valid only in the sphere of phenomena, and thus it may appear as the\nnecessary nexus of space and time, or as the law of causality, or as the\nlaw of the ground of knowledge. The inner nature of the world, the\nthing-in-itself can never be found by the guidance of this principle, for\nall that it leads to will be found to be dependent and relative and merely\nphenomenal, not the thing-in-itself. Further, it does not concern the\nsubject, but is only the form of objects, which are therefore not\nthings-in-themselves. The subject must exist along with the object, and\nthe object along with the subject, so that it is impossible that subject\nand object can stand to each other in a relation of reason and consequent.\nBut Fichte did not take up the smallest fragment of all this. All that\ninterested him about the matter was that the system started from the\nsubject. Now Kant had chosen this procedure in order to show the fallacy\nof the prevalent systems, which started from the object, and through which\nthe object had come, to be regarded as a thing-in-itself. Fichte, however,\ntook this departure from the subject for the really important matter, and\nlike all imitators, he imagined that in going further than Kant he was\nsurpassing him. Thus he repeated the fallacy with regard to the subject,\nwhich all the previous dogmatism had perpetrated with regard to the\nobject, and which had been the occasion of Kant’s “Critique”. Fichte then\nmade no material change, and the fundamental fallacy, the assumption of a\nrelation of reason and consequent between object and subject, remained\nafter him as it was before him. The principle of sufficient reason\npossessed as before an unconditioned validity, and the only difference was\nthat the thing-in-itself was now placed in the subject instead of, as\nformerly, in the object. The entire relativity of both subject and object,\nwhich proves that the thing-in-itself, or the inner nature of the world,\nis not to be sought in them at all, but outside of them, and outside\neverything else that exists merely relatively, still remained unknown.\nJust as if Kant had never existed, the principle of sufficient reason is\nto Fichte precisely what it was to all the schoolmen, a _veritas aeterna_.\nAs an eternal fate reigned over the gods of old, so these _aeternæ\nveritates_, these metaphysical, mathematical and metalogical truths, and\nin the case of some, the validity of the moral law also, reigned over the\nGod of the schoolmen. These _veritates_ alone were independent of\neverything, and through their necessity both God and the world existed.\nAccording to the principle of sufficient reason, as such a _veritas\naeterna_, the _ego_ is for Fichte the ground of the world, or of the\n_non-ego_, the object, which is just its consequent, its creation. He has\ntherefore taken good care to avoid examining further or limiting the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. If, however, it is thought I should\nspecify the form of the principle of sufficient reason under the guidance\nof which Fichte derives the _non-ego_ from the _ego_, as a spider spins\nits web out of itself, I find that it is the principle of sufficient\nreason of existence in space: for it is only as referred to this that some\nkind of meaning and sense can be attached to the laboured deductions of\nthe way in which the _ego_ produces and fabricates the _non-ego_ from\nitself, which form the content of the most senseless, and consequently the\nmost wearisome book that was ever written. This philosophy of Fichte,\notherwise not worth mentioning, is interesting to us only as the tardy\nexpression of the converse of the old materialism. For materialism was the\nmost consistent system starting from the object, as this is the most\nconsistent system starting from the subject. Materialism overlooked the\nfact that, with the simplest object, it assumed the subject also; and\nFichte overlooked the fact that with the subject (whatever he may call it)\nhe assumed the object also, for no subject is thinkable without an object.\nBesides this he forgot that all _a priori_ deduction, indeed all\ndemonstration in general, must rest upon some necessity, and that all\nnecessity is based on the principle of sufficient reason, because to be\nnecessary, and to follow from given grounds are convertible\nconceptions.(10) But the principle of sufficient reason is just the\nuniversal form of the object as such. Thus it is in the object, but is not\nvalid before and outside of it; it first produces the object and makes it\nappear in conformity with its regulative principle. We see then that the\nsystem which starts from the subject contains the same fallacy as the\nsystem, explained above, which starts from the object; it begins by\nassuming what it proposes to deduce, the necessary correlative of its\nstarting-point.\n\nThe method of our own system is _toto genere_ distinct from these two\nopposite misconceptions, for we start neither from the object nor from the\nsubject, but from the _idea_, as the first fact of consciousness. Its\nfirst essential, fundamental form is the antithesis of subject and object.\nThe form of the object again is the principle of sufficient reason in its\nvarious forms. Each of these reigns so absolutely in its own class of\nideas that, as we have seen, when the special form of the principle of\nsufficient reason which governs any class of ideas is known, the nature of\nthe whole class is known also: for the whole class, as idea, is no more\nthan this form of the principle of sufficient reason itself; so that time\nitself is nothing but the principle of existence in it, _i.e._,\nsuccession; space is nothing but the principle of existence in it, _i.e._,\nposition; matter is nothing but causality; the concept (as will appear\nimmediately) is nothing but relation to a ground of knowledge. This\nthorough and consistent relativity of the world as idea, both according to\nits universal form (subject and object), and according to the form which\nis subordinate to this (the principle of sufficient reason) warns us, as\nwe said before, to seek the inner nature of the world in an aspect of it\nwhich is _quite different and quite distinct from the idea_; and in the\nnext book we shall find this in a fact which is just as immediate to every\nliving being as the idea.\n\nBut we must first consider that class of ideas which belongs to man alone.\nThe matter of these is the concept, and the subjective correlative is\nreason, just as the subjective correlative of the ideas we have already\nconsidered was understanding and sensibility, which are also to be\nattributed to all the lower animals.(11)",

    "page_content": "because perception arises through the knowledge of causality, the relation\nof subject and object is that of cause and effect. For this relation\nsubsists only between the immediate object and objects known indirectly,\nthus always between objects alone. It is this false supposition that has\ngiven rise to the foolish controversy about the reality of the outer\nworld; a controversy in which dogmatism and scepticism oppose each other,\nand the former appears, now as realism, now as idealism. Realism treats\nthe object as cause, and the subject as its effect. The idealism of Fichte\nreduces the object to the effect of the subject. Since however, and this\ncannot be too much emphasised, there is absolutely no relation according\nto the principle of sufficient reason between subject and object, neither\nof these views could be proved, and therefore scepticism attacked them\nboth with success. Now, just as the law of causality precedes perception\nand experience as their condition, and therefore cannot (as Hume thought)\nbe derived from them, so object and subject precede all knowledge, and\nhence the principle of sufficient reason in general, as its first\ncondition; for this principle is merely the form of all objects, the whole\nnature and possibility of their existence as phenomena: but the object\nalways presupposes the subject; and therefore between these two there can\nbe no relation of reason and consequent. My essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason accomplishes just this: it explains the content of that\nprinciple as the essential form of every object—that is to say, as the\nuniversal nature of all objective existence, as something which pertains\nto the object as such; but the object as such always presupposes the\nsubject as its necessary correlative; and therefore the subject remains\nalways outside the province in which the principle of sufficient reason is\nvalid. The controversy as to the reality of the outer world rests upon\nthis false extension of the validity of the principle of sufficient reason\nto the subject also, and starting with this mistake it can never\nunderstand itself. On the one side realistic dogmatism, looking upon the\nidea as the effect of the object, desires to separate these two, idea and\nobject, which are really one, and to assume a cause quite different from\nthe idea, an object in itself, independent of the subject, a thing which\nis quite inconceivable; for even as object it presupposes subject, and so\nremains its idea. Opposed to this doctrine is scepticism, which makes the\nsame false presupposition that in the idea we have only the effect, never\nthe cause, therefore never real being; that we always know merely the\naction of the object. But this object, it supposes, may perhaps have no\nresemblance whatever to its effect, may indeed have been quite erroneously\nreceived as the cause, for the law of causality is first to be gathered\nfrom experience, and the reality of experience is then made to rest upon\nit. Thus both of these views are open to the correction, firstly, that\nobject and idea are the same; secondly, that the true being of the object\nof perception is its action, that the reality of the thing consists in\nthis, and the demand for an existence of the object outside the idea of\nthe subject, and also for an essence of the actual thing different from\nits action, has absolutely no meaning, and is a contradiction: and that\nthe knowledge of the nature of the effect of any perceived object,\nexhausts such an object itself, so far as it is object, _i.e._, idea, for\nbeyond this there is nothing more to be known. So far then, the perceived\nworld in space and time, which makes itself known as causation alone, is\nentirely real, and is throughout simply what it appears to be, and it\nappears wholly and without reserve as idea, bound together according to\nthe law of causality. This is its empirical reality. On the other hand,\nall causality is in the understanding alone, and for the understanding.\nThe whole actual, that is, active world is determined as such through the\nunderstanding, and apart from it is nothing. This, however, is not the\nonly reason for altogether denying such a reality of the outer world as is\ntaught by the dogmatist, who explains its reality as its independence of\nthe subject. We also deny it, because no object apart from a subject can\nbe conceived without contradiction. The whole world of objects is and\nremains idea, and therefore wholly and for ever determined by the subject;\nthat is to say, it has transcendental ideality. But it is not therefore\nillusion or mere appearance; it presents itself as that which it is, idea,\nand indeed as a series of ideas of which the common bond is the principle\nof sufficient reason. It is according to its inmost meaning quite\ncomprehensible to the healthy understanding, and speaks a language quite\nintelligible to it. To dispute about its reality can only occur to a mind\nperverted by over-subtilty, and such discussion always arises from a false\napplication of the principle of sufficient reason, which binds all ideas\ntogether of whatever kind they may be, but by no means connects them with\nthe subject, nor yet with a something which is neither subject nor object,\nbut only the ground of the object; an absurdity, for only objects can be\nand always are the ground of objects. If we examine more closely the\nsource of this question as to the reality of the outer world, we find that\nbesides the false application of the principle of sufficient reason\ngenerally to what lies beyond its province, a special confusion of its\nforms is also involved; for that form which it has only in reference to\nconcepts or abstract ideas, is applied to perceived ideas, real objects;\nand a ground of knowing is demanded of objects, whereas they can have\nnothing but a ground of being. Among the abstract ideas, the concepts\nunited in the judgment, the principle of sufficient reason appears in such\na way that each of these has its worth, its validity, and its whole\nexistence, here called _truth_, simply and solely through the relation of\nthe judgment to something outside of it, its ground of knowledge, to which\nthere must consequently always be a return. Among real objects, ideas of\nperception, on the other hand, the principle of sufficient reason appears\nnot as the principle of the ground of _knowing_, but of _being_, as the\nlaw of causality: every real object has paid its debt to it, inasmuch as\nit has come to be, _i.e._, has appeared as the effect of a cause. The\ndemand for a ground of knowing has therefore here no application and no\nmeaning, but belongs to quite another class of things. Thus the world of\nperception raises in the observer no question or doubt so long as he\nremains in contact with it: there is here neither error nor truth, for\nthese are confined to the province of the abstract—the province of\nreflection. But here the world lies open for sense and understanding;\npresents itself with naive truth as that which it really is—ideas of\nperception which develop themselves according to the law of causality.\n\nSo far as we have considered the question of the reality of the outer\nworld, it arises from a confusion which amounts even to a misunderstanding\nof reason itself, and therefore thus far, the question could be answered\nonly by explaining its meaning. After examination of the whole nature of\nthe principle of sufficient reason, of the relation of subject and object,\nand the special conditions of sense perception, the question itself\ndisappeared because it had no longer any meaning. There is, however, one\nother possible origin of this question, quite different from the purely\nspeculative one which we have considered, a specially empirical origin,\nthough the question is always raised from a speculative point of view, and\nin this form it has a much more comprehensible meaning than it had in the\nfirst. We have dreams; may not our whole life be a dream? or more exactly:\nis there a sure criterion of the distinction between dreams and reality?\nbetween phantasms and real objects? The assertion that what is dreamt is\nless vivid and distinct than what we actually perceive is not to the\npoint, because no one has ever been able to make a fair comparison of the\ntwo; for we can only compare the recollection of a dream with the present\nreality. Kant answers the question thus: “The connection of ideas among\nthemselves, according to the law of causality, constitutes the difference\nbetween real life and dreams.” But in dreams, as well as in real life,\neverything is connected individually at any rate, in accordance with the\nprinciple of sufficient reason in all its forms, and this connection is\nbroken only between life and dreams, or between one dream and another.\nKant’s answer therefore could only run thus:—the _long_ dream (life) has\nthroughout complete connection according to the principle of sufficient\nreason; it has not this connection, however, with _short_ dreams, although\neach of these has in itself the same connection: the bridge is therefore\nbroken between the former and the latter, and on this account we\ndistinguish them.\n\nBut to institute an inquiry according to this criterion, as to whether\nsomething was dreamt or seen, would always be difficult and often\nimpossible. For we are by no means in a position to trace link by link the\ncausal connection between any experienced event and the present moment,\nbut we do not on that account explain it as dreamt. Therefore in real life\nwe do not commonly employ that method of distinguishing between dreams and\nreality. The only sure criterion by which to distinguish them is in fact\nthe entirely empirical one of awaking, through which at any rate the\ncausal connection between dreamed events and those of waking life, is\ndistinctly and sensibly broken off. This is strongly supported by the\nremark of Hobbes in the second chapter of Leviathan, that we easily\nmistake dreams for reality if we have unintentionally fallen asleep\nwithout taking off our clothes, and much more so when it also happens that\nsome undertaking or design fills all our thoughts, and occupies our dreams\nas well as our waking moments. We then observe the awaking just as little\nas the falling asleep, dream and reality run together and become\nconfounded. In such a case there is nothing for it but the application of\nKant’s criterion; but if, as often happens, we fail to establish by means\nof this criterion, either the existence of causal connection with the\npresent, or the absence of such connection, then it must for ever remain\nuncertain whether an event was dreamt or really happened. Here, in fact,\nthe intimate relationship between life and dreams is brought out very\nclearly, and we need not be ashamed to confess it, as it has been\nrecognised and spoken of by many great men. The Vedas and Puranas have no\nbetter simile than a dream for the whole knowledge of the actual world,\nwhich they call the web of Mâyâ, and they use none more frequently. Plato\noften says that men live only in a dream; the philosopher alone strives to\nawake himself. Pindar says (ii. η. 135): σκιας οναρ ανθρωπος (umbræ\nsomnium homo), and Sophocles:—\n\n    Ὀνω γυν ἡμας ουδεν οντας αλλο, πλην\n    Σιδωλ᾽ ὁσοιπερ ζωμεν, ὴ κουφην σκιαν.—Ajax, 125.\n\n(Nos enim, quicunque vivimus, nihil aliud esse comperio quam simulacra et\nlevem umbram.) Beside which most worthily stands Shakespeare:—\n\n          “We are such stuff\n    As dreams are made on, and our little life\n    Is rounded with a sleep.”—_Tempest_, Act iv. Sc. 1.\n\nLastly, Calderon was so deeply impressed with this view of life that he\nsought to embody it in a kind of metaphysical drama—“Life a Dream.”\n\nAfter these numerous quotations from the poets, perhaps I also may be\nallowed to express myself by a metaphor. Life and dreams are leaves of the\nsame book. The systematic reading of this book is real life, but when the\nreading hours (that is, the day) are over, we often continue idly to turn\nover the leaves, and read a page here and there without method or\nconnection: often one we have read before, sometimes one that is new to\nus, but always in the same book. Such an isolated page is indeed out of\nconnection with the systematic study of the book, but it does not seem so\nvery different when we remember that the whole continuous perusal begins\nand ends just as abruptly, and may therefore be regarded as merely a\nlarger single page.\n\nThus although individual dreams are distinguished from real life by the\nfact that they do not fit into that continuity which runs through the\nwhole of experience, and the act of awaking brings this into\nconsciousness, yet that very continuity of experience belongs to real life\nas its form, and the dream on its part can point to a similar continuity\nin itself. If, therefore, we consider the question from a point of view\nexternal to both, there is no distinct difference in their nature, and we\nare forced to concede to the poets that life is a long dream.\n\nLet us turn back now from this quite independent empirical origin of the\nquestion of the reality of the outer world, to its speculative origin. We\nfound that this consisted, first, in the false application of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason to the relation of subject and object; and\nsecondly, in the confusion of its forms, inasmuch as the principle of\nsufficient reason of knowing was extended to a province in which the\nprinciple of sufficient reason of being is valid. But the question could\nhardly have occupied philosophers so constantly if it were entirely devoid\nof all real content, and if some true thought and meaning did not lie at\nits heart as its real source. Accordingly, we must assume that when the\nelement of truth that lies at the bottom of the question first came into\nreflection and sought its expression, it became involved in these confused\nand meaningless forms and problems. This at least is my opinion, and I\nthink that the true expression of that inmost meaning of the question,\nwhich it failed to find, is this:—What is this world of perception besides\nbeing my idea? Is that of which I am conscious only as idea, exactly like\nmy own body, of which I am doubly conscious, in one aspect as _idea_, in\nanother aspect as _will_? The fuller explanation of this question and its\nanswer in the affirmative, will form the content of the second book, and\nits consequences will occupy the remaining portion of this work.",

    "page_content": "moon, we pass from the immediate idea of perception, which stands by\nitself and is its own warrant, to reflection, to the abstract, discursive\nconcepts of the reason, which obtain their whole content from knowledge of\nperception, and in relation to it. As long as we continue simply to\nperceive, all is clear, firm, and certain. There are neither questions nor\ndoubts nor errors; we desire to go no further, can go no further; we find\nrest in perceiving, and satisfaction in the present. Perception suffices\nfor itself, and therefore what springs purely from it, and remains true to\nit, for example, a genuine work of art, can never be false, nor can it be\ndiscredited through the lapse of time, for it does not present an opinion\nbut the thing itself. But with abstract knowledge, with reason, doubt and\nerror appear in the theoretical, care and sorrow in the practical. In the\nidea of perception, illusion may at moments take the place of the real;\nbut in the sphere of abstract thought, error may reign for a thousand\nyears, impose its yoke upon whole nations, extend to the noblest impulses\nof humanity, and, by the help of its slaves and its dupes, may chain and\nfetter those whom it cannot deceive. It is the enemy against which the\nwisest men of all times have waged unequal war, and only what they have\nwon from it has become the possession of mankind. Therefore it is well to\ndraw attention to it at once, as we already tread the ground to which its\nprovince belongs. It has often been said that we ought to follow truth\neven although no utility can be seen in it, because it may have indirect\nutility which may appear when it is least expected; and I would add to\nthis, that we ought to be just as anxious to discover and to root out all\nerror even when no harm is anticipated from it, because its mischief may\nbe very indirect, and may suddenly appear when we do not expect it, for\nall error has poison at its heart. If it is mind, if it is knowledge, that\nmakes man the lord of creation, there can be no such thing as harmless\nerror, still less venerable and holy error. And for the consolation of\nthose who in any way and at any time may have devoted strength and life to\nthe noble and hard battle against error, I cannot refrain from adding\nthat, so long as truth is absent, error will have free play, as owls and\nbats in the night; but sooner would we expect to see the owls and the bats\ndrive back the sun in the eastern heavens, than that any truth which has\nonce been known and distinctly and fully expressed, can ever again be so\nutterly vanquished and overcome that the old error shall once more reign\nundisturbed over its wide kingdom. This is the power of truth; its\nconquest is slow and laborious, but if once the victory be gained it can\nnever be wrested back again.\n\nBesides the ideas we have as yet considered, which, according to their\nconstruction, could be referred to time, space, and matter, if we consider\nthem with reference to the object, or to pure sensibility and\nunderstanding (_i.e._, knowledge of causality), if we consider them with\nreference to the subject, another faculty of knowledge has appeared in man\nalone of all earthly creatures, an entirely new consciousness, which, with\nvery appropriate and significant exactness, is called _reflection_. For it\nis in fact derived from the knowledge of perception, and is a reflected\nappearance of it. But it has assumed a nature fundamentally different. The\nforms of perception do not affect it, and even the principle of sufficient\nreason which reigns over all objects has an entirely different aspect with\nregard to it. It is just this new, more highly endowed, consciousness,\nthis abstract reflex of all that belongs to perception in that conception\nof the reason which has nothing to do with perception, that gives to man\nthat thoughtfulness which distinguishes his consciousness so entirely from\nthat of the lower animals, and through which his whole behaviour upon\nearth is so different from that of his irrational fellow-creatures. He far\nsurpasses them in power and also in suffering. They live in the present\nalone, he lives also in the future and the past. They satisfy the needs of\nthe moment, he provides by the most ingenious preparations for the future,\nyea for days that he shall never see. They are entirely dependent on the\nimpression of the moment, on the effect of the perceptible motive; he is\ndetermined by abstract conceptions independent of the present. Therefore\nhe follows predetermined plans, he acts from maxims, without reference to\nhis surroundings or the accidental impression of the moment. Thus, for\nexample, he can make with composure deliberate preparations for his own\ndeath, he can dissemble past finding out, and can carry his secret with\nhim to the grave; lastly, he has an actual choice between several motives;\nfor only in the abstract can such motives, present together in\nconsciousness, afford the knowledge with regard to themselves, that the\none excludes the other, and can thus measure themselves against each other\nwith reference to their power over the will. The motive that overcomes, in\nthat it decides the question at issue, is the deliberate determinant of\nthe will, and is a sure indication of its character. The brute, on the\nother hand, is determined by the present impression; only the fear of\npresent compulsion can constrain its desires, until at last this fear has\nbecome custom, and as such continues to determine it; this is called\ntraining. The brute feels and perceives; man, in addition to this,\n_thinks_ and _knows_: both _will_. The brute expresses its feelings and\ndispositions by gestures and sounds; man communicates his thought to\nothers, or, if he wishes, he conceals it, by means of speech. Speech is\nthe first production, and also the necessary organ of his reason.\nTherefore in Greek and Italian, speech and reason are expressed by the\nsame word; ὁ λογος, _il discorso_. _Vernunft_ is derived from _vernehmen_,\nwhich is not a synonym for the verb to hear, but signifies the\nconsciousness of the meaning of thoughts communicated in words. It is by\nthe help of language alone that reason accomplishes its most important\nachievements,—the united action of several individuals, the planned\nco-operation of many thousands, civilisation, the state; also science, the\nstoring up of experience, the uniting of common properties in one concept,\nthe communication of truth, the spread of error, thoughts and poems,\ndogmas and superstitions. The brute first knows death when it dies, but\nman draws consciously nearer to it every hour that he lives; and this\nmakes life at times a questionable good even to him who has not recognised\nthis character of constant annihilation in the whole of life. Principally\non this account man has philosophies and religions, though it is uncertain\nwhether the qualities we admire most in his conduct, voluntary rectitude\nand nobility of feeling, were ever the fruit of either of them. As results\nwhich certainly belong only to them, and as productions of reason in this\nsphere, we may refer to the marvellous and monstrous opinions of\nphilosophers of various schools, and the extraordinary and sometimes cruel\ncustoms of the priests of different religions.\n\nIt is the universal opinion of all times and of all nations that these\nmanifold and far-reaching achievements spring from a common principle,\nfrom that peculiar intellectual power which belongs distinctively to man\nand which has been called reason, ὁ λογος, το λογιστικον, το λογιμον,\n_ratio_. Besides this, no one finds any difficulty in recognising the\nmanifestations of this faculty, and in saying what is rational and what is\nirrational, where reason appears as distinguished from the other faculties\nand qualities of man, or lastly, in pointing out what, on account of the\nwant of reason, we must never expect even from the most sensible brute.\nThe philosophers of all ages may be said to be on the whole at one about\nthis general knowledge of reason, and they have also given prominence to\nseveral very important manifestations of it; such as, the control of the\nemotions and passions, the capacity for drawing conclusions and\nformulating general principles, even such as are true prior to all\nexperience, and so forth. Still all their explanations of the peculiar\nnature of reason are wavering, not clearly defined, discursive, without\nunity and concentration; now laying stress on one manifestation, now on\nanother, and therefore often at variance with each other. Besides this,\nmany start from the opposition between reason and revelation, a\ndistinction which is unknown to philosophy, and which only increases\nconfusion. It is very remarkable that up till now no philosopher has\nreferred these manifold expressions of reason to one simple function which\nwould be recognised in them all, from which they would all be explained,\nand which would therefore constitute the real inner nature of reason. It\nis true that the excellent Locke in the “Essay on the Human Understanding”\n(Book II., ch. xi., §§ 10 and 11), very rightly refers to general concepts\nas the characteristic which distinguishes man from the brutes, and\nLeibnitz quotes this with full approval in the “Nouveaux Essais sur\nl’Entendement Humaine” (Book II., ch. xi., §§ 10 and 11.) But when Locke\n(in Book IV., ch. xvii., §§ 2 and 3) comes to the special explanation of\nreason he entirely loses sight of this simple, primary characteristic, and\nhe also falls into a wavering, undetermined, incomplete account of mangled\nand derivative manifestations of it. Leibnitz also, in the corresponding\npart of his work, behaves in a similar manner, only with more confusion\nand indistinctness. In the Appendix, I have fully considered how Kant\nconfused and falsified the conception of the nature of reason. But whoever\nwill take the trouble to go through in this reference the mass of\nphilosophical writing which has appeared since Kant, will find out, that\njust as the faults of princes must be expiated by whole nations, the\nerrors of great minds extend their influence over whole generations, and\neven over centuries; they grow and propagate themselves, and finally\ndegenerate into monstrosities. All this arises from the fact that, as\nBerkeley says, “Few men think; yet all will have opinions.”\n\nThe understanding has only one function—immediate knowledge of the\nrelation of cause and effect. Yet the perception of the real world, and\nall common sense, sagacity, and inventiveness, however multifarious their\napplications may be, are quite clearly seen to be nothing more than\nmanifestations of that one function. So also the reason has one function;\nand from it all the manifestations of reason we have mentioned, which\ndistinguish the life of man from that of the brutes, may easily be\nexplained. The application or the non-application of this function is all\nthat is meant by what men have everywhere and always called rational and\nirrational.(12)",

We can therefore never attain to a sensuous and,\nproperly speaking, evident knowledge of their nature, but only to a\nknowledge which is abstract and discursive. It would, therefore, be absurd\nto demand that they should be verified in experience, if by experience is\nmeant the real external world, which consists of ideas of perception, or\nthat they should be brought before the eyes or the imagination like\nobjects of perception. They can only be thought, not perceived, and only\nthe effects which men accomplish through them are properly objects of\nexperience. Such effects are language, preconceived and planned action and\nscience, and all that results from these. Speech, as an object of outer\nexperience, is obviously nothing more than a very complete telegraph,\nwhich communicates arbitrary signs with the greatest rapidity and the\nfinest distinctions of difference. But what do these signs mean? How are\nthey interpreted? When some one speaks, do we at once translate his words\ninto pictures of the fancy, which instantaneously flash upon us, arrange\nand link themselves together, and assume form and colour according to the\nwords that are poured forth, and their grammatical inflections? What a\ntumult there would be in our brains while we listened to a speech, or to\nthe reading of a book? But what actually happens is not this at all. The\nmeaning of a speech is, as a rule, immediately grasped, accurately and\ndistinctly taken in, without the imagination being brought into play. It\nis reason which speaks to reason, keeping within its own province. It\ncommunicates and receives abstract conceptions, ideas that cannot be\npresented in perceptions, which are framed once for all, and are\nrelatively few in number, but which yet encompass, contain, and represent\nall the innumerable objects of the actual world. This itself is sufficient\nto prove that the lower animals can never learn to speak or comprehend,\nalthough they have the organs of speech and ideas of perception in common\nwith us. But because words represent this perfectly distinct class of\nideas, whose subjective correlative is reason, they are without sense and\nmeaning for the brutes. Thus language, like every other manifestation\nwhich we ascribe to reason, and like everything which distinguishes man\nfrom the brutes, is to be explained from this as its one simple\nsource—conceptions, abstract ideas which cannot be presented in\nperception, but are general, and have no individual existence in space and\ntime. Only in single cases do we pass from the conception to the\nperception, do we construct images as _representatives of concepts_ in\nperception, to which, however, they are never adequate. These cases are\nfully discussed in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 28,\nand therefore I shall not repeat my explanation here. It may be compared,\nhowever, with what is said by Hume in the twelfth of his “Philosophical\nEssays,” p. 244, and by Herder in the “Metacritik,” pt. i. p. 274 (an\notherwise worthless book). The Platonic idea, the possibility of which\ndepends upon the union of imagination and reason, is the principal subject\nof the third book of this work.\n\nAlthough concepts are fundamentally different from ideas of perception,\nthey stand in a necessary relation to them, without which they would be\nnothing. This relation therefore constitutes the whole nature and\nexistence of concepts. Reflection is the necessary copy or repetition of\nthe originally presented world of perception, but it is a special kind of\ncopy in an entirely different material. Thus concepts may quite properly\nbe called ideas of ideas. The principle of sufficient reason has here also\na special form. Now we have seen that the form under which the principle\nof sufficient reason appears in a class of ideas always constitutes and\nexhausts the whole nature of the class, so far as it consists of ideas, so\nthat time is throughout succession, and nothing more; space is throughout\nposition, and nothing more; matter is throughout causation, and nothing\nmore. In the same way the whole nature of concepts, or the class of\nabstract ideas, consists simply in the relation which the principle of\nsufficient reason expresses in them; and as this is the relation to the\nground of knowledge, the whole nature of the abstract idea is simply and\nsolely its relation to another idea, which is its ground of knowledge.\nThis, indeed, may, in the first instance, be a concept, an abstract idea,\nand this again may have only a similar abstract ground of knowledge; but\nthe chain of grounds of knowledge does not extend _ad infinitum_; it must\nend at last in a concept which has its ground in knowledge of perception;\nfor the whole world of reflection rests on the world of perception as its\nground of knowledge. Hence the class of abstract ideas is in this respect\ndistinguished from other classes; in the latter the principle of\nsufficient reason always demands merely a relation to another idea of the\n_same_ class, but in the case of abstract ideas, it at last demands a\nrelation to an idea of _another_ class.\n\nThose concepts which, as has just been pointed out, are not immediately\nrelated to the world of perception, but only through the medium of one, or\nit may be several other concepts, have been called by preference\n_abstracta_, and those which have their ground immediately in the world of\nperception have been called _concreta_. But this last name is only loosely\napplicable to the concepts denoted by it, for they are always merely\n_abstracta_, and not ideas of perception. These names, which have\noriginated in a very dim consciousness of the distinctions they imply, may\nyet, with this explanation, be retained. As examples of the first kind of\nconcepts, _i.e._, _abstracta_ in the fullest sense, we may take\n“relation,” “virtue,” “investigation,” “beginning,” and so on. As examples\nof the second kind, loosely called _concreta_, we may take such concepts\nas “man,” “stone,” “horse,” &c. If it were not a somewhat too pictorial\nand therefore absurd simile, we might very appropriately call the latter\nthe ground floor, and the former the upper stories of the building of\nreflection.(13)\n\nIt is not, as is commonly supposed, an essential characteristic of a\nconcept that it should contain much under it, that is to say, that many\nideas of perception, or it may be other abstract ideas, should stand to it\nin the relation of its ground of knowledge, _i.e._, be thought through it.\nThis is merely a derived and secondary characteristic, and, as a matter of\nfact, does not always exist, though it must always exist potentially. This\ncharacteristic arises from the fact that a concept is an idea of an idea,\n_i.e._, its whole nature consists in its relation to another idea; but as\nit is not this idea itself, which is generally an idea of perception and\ntherefore belongs to quite a different class, the latter may have\ntemporal, spacial, and other determinations, and in general many relations\nwhich are not thought along with it in the concept. Thus we see that\nseveral ideas which are different in unessential particulars may be\nthought by means of one concept, _i.e._, may be brought under it. Yet this\npower of embracing several things is not an essential but merely an\naccidental characteristic of the concept. There may be concepts through\nwhich only one real object is thought, but which are nevertheless abstract\nand general, by no means capable of presentation individually and as\nperceptions. Such, for example, is the conception which any one may have\nof a particular town which he only knows from geography; although only\nthis one town is thought under it, it might yet be applied to several\ntowns differing in certain respects. We see then that a concept is not\ngeneral because of being abstracted from several objects; but conversely,\nbecause generality, that is to say, non-determination of the particular,\nbelongs to the concept as an abstract idea of the reason, different things\ncan be thought by means of the same one.\n\nIt follows from what has been said that every concept, just because it is\nabstract and incapable of presentation in perception, and is therefore not\na completely determined idea, has what is called extension or sphere, even\nin the case in which only one real object exists that corresponds to it.\nNow we always find that the sphere of one concept has something in common\nwith the sphere of other concepts. That is to say, part of what is thought\nunder one concept is the same as what is thought under other concepts; and\nconversely, part of what is thought under these concepts is the same as\nwhat is thought under the first; although, if they are really different\nconcepts, each of them, or at least one of them, contains something which\nthe other does not contain; this is the relation in which every subject\nstands to its predicate. The recognition of this relation is called\njudgment. The representation of these spheres by means of figures in\nspace, is an exceedingly happy idea. It first occurred to Gottfried\nPlouquet, who used squares for the purpose. Lambert, although later than\nhim, used only lines, which he placed under each other. Euler carried out\nthe idea completely with circles. Upon what this complete analogy between\nthe relations of concepts, and those of figures in space, ultimately\nrests, I am unable to say. It is, however, a very fortunate circumstance\nfor logic that all the relations of concepts, according to their\npossibility, _i.e._, _a priori_, may be made plain in perception by the\nuse of such figures, in the following way:—\n\n(1.) The spheres of two concepts coincide: for example the concept of\nnecessity and the concept of following from given grounds, in the same way\nthe concepts of _Ruminantia_ and _Bisulca_ (ruminating and cloven-hoofed\nanimals), also those of vertebrate and red-blooded animals (although there\nmight be some doubt about this on account of the annelida): they are\nconvertible concepts. Such concepts are represented by a single circle\nwhich stands for either of them.\n\n(2.) The sphere of one concept includes that of the other.\n\n        \n\n(3.) A sphere includes two or more spheres which exclude each other and\nfill it.\n\n(4.) Two spheres include each a part of the other.\n\n   \n\n(5.) Two spheres lie in a third, but do not fill it.\n\n   [Illustration: A large circle, \"matter\", within which are two other\n                      circles, \"water\" and \"earth\".]\n\nThis last case applies to all concepts whose spheres have nothing\nimmediately in common, for there is always a third sphere, often a much\nwider one, which includes both.\n\nTo these cases all combinations of concepts may be referred, and from them\nthe entire doctrine of the judgment, its conversion, contraposition,\nequipollence, disjunction (this according to the third figure) may be\ndeduced. From these also may be derived the properties of the judgment,\nupon which Kant based his pretended categories of the understanding, with\nthe exception however of the hypothetical form, which is not a combination\nof concepts, but of judgments. A full account is given in the Appendix of\n“Modality,” and indeed of every property of judgments on which the\ncategories are founded.\n\nWith regard to the possible combinations of concepts which we have given,\nit has only further to be remarked that they may also be combined with\neach other in many ways. For example, the fourth figure with the second.\nOnly if one sphere, which partly or wholly contains another, is itself\ncontained in a third sphere, do these together exemplify the syllogism in\nthe first figure, _i.e._, that combination of judgments, by means of which\nit is known that a concept which is partly or wholly contained in another\nconcept, is also contained in a third concept, which again contains the\nfirst: and also, conversely, the negation; the pictorial representation of\nwhich can, of course, only be two connected spheres which do not lie\nwithin a third sphere. If many spheres are brought together in this way we\nget a long train of syllogisms. This schematism of concepts, which has\nalready been fairly well explained in more than one textbook, may be used\nas the foundation of the doctrine of the judgment, and indeed of the whole\nsyllogistic theory, and in this way the treatment of both becomes very\neasy and simple. Because, through it, all syllogistic rules may be seen in\ntheir origin, and may be deduced and explained. It is not necessary,\nhowever, to load the memory with these rules, as logic is never of\npractical use, but has only a theoretical interest for philosophy. For\nalthough it may be said that logic is related to rational thinking as\nthorough-bass is to music, or less exactly, as ethics is to virtue, or\næsthetics to art; we must yet remember that no one ever became an artist\nby the study of æsthetics; that a noble character was never formed by the\nstudy of ethics; that long before Rameau, men composed correctly and\nbeautifully, and that we do not need to know thorough-bass in order to\ndetect discords: and just as little do we need to know logic in order to\navoid being misled by fallacies. Yet it must be conceded that\nthorough-bass is of the greatest use in the practice of musical\ncomposition, although it may not be necessary for the understanding of it;\nand indeed æsthetics and even ethics, though in a much less degree, and\nfor the most part negatively, may be of some use in practice, so that we\ncannot deny them all practical worth, but of logic even this much cannot\nbe conceded. It is nothing more than the knowledge in the abstract of what\nevery one knows in the concrete. Therefore we call in the aid of logical\nrules, just as little to enable us to construct a correct argument as to\nprevent us from consenting to a false one, and the most learned logician\nlays aside the rules of logic altogether in his actual thought. This may\nbe explained in the following way. Every science is a system of general\nand therefore abstract truths, laws, and rules with reference to a special\nclass of objects. The individual case coming under these laws is\ndetermined in accordance with this general knowledge, which is valid once\nfor all; because such application of the general principle is far easier\nthan the exhaustive investigation of the particular case; for the general\nabstract knowledge which has once been obtained is always more within our\nreach than the empirical investigation of the particular case. With logic,\nhowever, it is just the other way. It is the general knowledge of the mode\nof procedure of the reason expressed in the form of rules. It is reached\nby the introspection of reason, and by abstraction from all content. But\nthis mode of procedure is necessary and essential to reason, so that it\nwill never depart from it if left to itself. It is, therefore, easier and\nsurer to let it proceed itself according to its nature in each particular\ncase, than to present to it the knowledge abstracted from this procedure\nin the form of a foreign and externally given law. It is easier, because,\nwhile in the case of all other sciences, the general rule is more within\nour reach than the investigation of the particular case taken by itself;\nwith the use of reason, on the contrary, its necessary procedure in a\ngiven case is always more within our reach than the general rule\nabstracted from it; for that which thinks in us is reason itself. It is\nsurer, because a mistake may more easily occur in such abstract knowledge,\nor in its application, than that a process of reason should take place\nwhich would run contrary to its essence and nature. Hence arises the\nremarkable fact, that while in other sciences the particular case is\nalways proved by the rule, in logic, on the contrary, the rule must always\nbe proved from the particular case; and even the most practised logician,\nif he remark that in some particular case he concludes otherwise than the\nrule prescribes, will always expect to find a mistake in the rule rather\nthan in his own conclusion. To desire to make practical use of logic\nmeans, therefore, to desire to derive with unspeakable trouble, from\ngeneral rules, that which is immediately known with the greatest certainty\nin the particular case. It is just as if a man were to consult mechanics\nas to the motion of his body, and physiology as to his digestion; and\nwhoever has learnt logic for practical purposes is like him who would\nteach a beaver to make its own dam. Logic is, therefore, without practical\nutility; but it must nevertheless be retained, because it has\nphilosophical interest as the special knowledge of the organisation and\naction of reason. It is rightly regarded as a definite, self-subsisting,\nself-contained, complete, and thoroughly safe discipline; to be treated\nscientifically for itself alone and independently of everything else, and\ntherefore to be studied at the universities. But it has its real value, in\nrelation to philosophy as a whole, in the inquiry into the nature of\nknowledge, and indeed of rational and abstract knowledge. Therefore the\nexposition of logic should not have so much the form of a practical\nscience, should not contain merely naked arbitrary rules for the correct\nformation of the judgment, the syllogism, &c., but should rather be\ndirected to the knowledge of the nature of reason and the concept, and to\nthe detailed investigation of the principle of sufficient reason of\nknowing. For logic is only a paraphrase of this principle, and, more\nexactly, only of that exemplification of it in which the ground that gives\ntruth to the judgment is neither empirical nor metaphysical, but logical\nor metalogical. Besides the principle of sufficient reason of knowing, it\nis necessary to take account of the three remaining fundamental laws of\nthought, or judgments of metalogical truth, so nearly related to it; and\nout of these the whole science of reason grows. The nature of thought\nproper, that is to say, of the judgment and the syllogism, must be\nexhibited in the combination of the spheres of concepts, according to the\nanalogy of the special schema, in the way shown above; and from all this\nthe rules of the judgment and the syllogism are to be deduced by\nconstruction. The only practical use we can make of logic is in a debate,\nwhen we can convict our antagonist of his intentional fallacies, rather\nthan of his actual mistakes, by giving them their technical names. By thus\nthrowing into the background the practical aim of logic, and bringing out\nits connection with the whole scheme of philosophy as one of its chapters,\nwe do not think that we shall make the study of it less prevalent than it\nis just now. For at the present day every one who does not wish to remain\nuncultured, and to be numbered with the ignorant and incompetent\nmultitude, must study speculative philosophy. For the nineteenth century\nis a philosophical age, though by this we do not mean either that it has\nphilosophy, or that philosophy governs it, but rather that it is ripe for\nphilosophy, and, therefore, stands in need of it. This is a sign of a high\ndegree of civilisation, and indeed, is a definite stage in the culture of\nthe ages.(14)\n\nThough logic is of so little practical use, it cannot be denied that it\nwas invented for practical purposes. It appears to me to have originated\nin the following way:—As the love of debating developed among the\nEleatics, the Megarics, and the Sophists, and by degrees became almost a\npassion, the confusion in which nearly every debate ended must have made\nthem feel the necessity of a method of procedure as a guide; and for this\na scientific dialectic had to be sought. The first thing which would have\nto be observed would be that both the disputing parties should always be\nagreed on some one proposition, to which the disputed points might be\nreferred. The beginning of the methodical procedure consisted in this,\nthat the propositions admitted on both sides were formally stated to be\nso, and placed at the head of the inquiry. But these propositions were at\nfirst concerned only with the material of the inquiry. It was soon\nobserved that in the process of going back to the truth admitted on both\nsides, and of deducing their assertions from it, each party followed\ncertain forms and laws about which, without any express agreement, there\nwas no difference of opinion. And from this it became evident that these\nmust constitute the peculiar and natural procedure of reason itself, the\nform of investigation. Although this was not exposed to any doubt or\ndifference of opinion, some pedantically systematic philosopher hit upon\nthe idea that it would look well, and be the completion of the method of\ndialectic, if this formal part of all discussion, this regular procedure\nof reason itself, were to be expressed in abstract propositions, just like\nthe substantial propositions admitted on both sides, and placed at the\nbeginning of every investigation, as the fixed canon of debate to which\nreference and appeal must always be made. In this way what had formerly\nbeen followed only by tacit agreement, and instinctively, would be\nconsciously recognised and formally expressed. By degrees, more or less\nperfect expressions were found for the fundamental principles of logic,\nsuch as the principles of contradiction, sufficient reason, excluded\nmiddle, the _dictum de omni et nullo_, as well as the special rules of the\nsyllogism, as for example, _ex meris particularibus aut negativis nihil\nsequitur, a rationato ad rationem non valet consequentia_, and so on. That\nall this was only brought about slowly, and with great pains, and up till\nthe time of Aristotle remained very incomplete, is evident from the\nawkward and tedious way in which logical truths are brought out in many of\nthe Platonic dialogues, and still more from what Sextus Empiricus tells us\nof the controversies of the Megarics, about the easiest and simplest\nlogical rules, and the laborious way in which they were brought into a\ndefinite form (Sext. Emp. adv. Math. l. 8, p. 112). But Aristotle\ncollected, arranged, and corrected all that had been discovered before his\ntime, and brought it to an incomparably greater state of perfection. If we\nthus observe how the course of Greek culture had prepared the way for, and\nled up to the work of Aristotle, we shall be little inclined to believe\nthe assertion of the Persian author, quoted by Sir William Jones with much\napproval, that Kallisthenes found a complete system of logic among the\nIndians, and sent it to his uncle Aristotle (Asiatic Researches, vol. iv.\np. 163). It is easy to understand that in the dreary middle ages the\nAristotelian logic would be very acceptable to the controversial spirit of\nthe schoolmen, which, in the absence of all real knowledge, spent its\nenergy upon mere formulas and words, and that it would be eagerly adopted\neven in its mutilated Arabian form, and presently established as the\ncentre of all knowledge. Though its authority has since declined, yet up\nto our own time logic has retained the credit of a self-contained,\npractical, and highly important science. Indeed, in our own day, the\nKantian philosophy, the foundation-stone of which is taken from logic, has\nexcited a new interest in it; which, in this respect, at any rate, that\nis, as the means of the knowledge of the nature of reason, it deserves.\n\nCorrect and accurate conclusions may be arrived at if we carefully observe\nthe relation of the spheres of concepts, and only conclude that one sphere\nis contained in a third sphere, when we have clearly seen that this first\nsphere is contained in a second, which in its turn is contained in the\nthird. On the other hand, the art of sophistry lies in casting only a\nsuperficial glance at the relations of the spheres of the concepts, and\nthen manipulating these relations to suit our purposes, generally in the\nfollowing way:—When the sphere of an observed concept lies partly within\nthat of another concept, and partly within a third altogether different\nsphere, we treat it as if it lay entirely within the one or the other, as\nmay suit our purpose. For example, in speaking of passion, we may subsume\nit under the concept of the greatest force, the mightiest agency in the\nworld, or under the concept of the irrational, and this again under the\nconcept of impotency or weakness. We may then repeat the process, and\nstart anew with each concept to which the argument leads us. A concept has\nalmost always several others, which partially come under it, and each of\nthese contains part of the sphere of the first, but also includes in its\nown sphere something more, which is not in the first. But we draw\nattention only to that one of these latter concepts, under which we wish\nto subsume the first, and let the others remain unobserved, or keep them\nconcealed. On the possession of this skill depends the whole art of\nsophistry and all finer fallacies; for logical fallacies such as\n_mentiens_, _velatus_, _cornatus_, &c., are clearly too clumsy for actual\nuse. I am not aware that hitherto any one has traced the nature of all\nsophistry and persuasion back to this last possible ground of its\nexistence, and referred it to the peculiar character of concepts, _i.e._,\nto the procedure of reason itself. Therefore, as my exposition has led me\nto it, though it is very easily understood, I will illustrate it in the\nfollowing table by means of a schema. This table is intended to show how\nthe spheres of concepts overlap each other at many points, and so leave\nroom for a passage from each concept to whichever one we please of several\nother concepts. I hope, however, that no one will be led by this table to\nattach more importance to this little explanation, which I have merely\ngiven in passing, than ought to belong to it, from the nature of the\nsubject. I have chosen as an illustration the concept of travelling. Its\nsphere partially includes four others, to any of which the sophist may\npass at will; these again partly include other spheres, several of them\ntwo or more at once, and through these the sophist takes whichever way he\nchooses, always as if it were the only way, till at last he reaches, in\ngood or evil, whatever end he may have in view. In passing from one sphere\nto another, it is only necessary always to follow the direction from the\ncentre (the given chief concept) to the circumference, and never to\nreverse this process. Such a piece of sophistry may be either an unbroken\nspeech, or it may assume the strict syllogistic form, according to what is\nthe weak side of the hearer. Most scientific arguments, and especially\nphilosophical demonstrations, are at bottom not much more than this, for\nhow else would it be possible, that so much, in different ages, has not\nonly been falsely apprehended (for error itself has a different source),\nbut demonstrated and proved, and has yet afterwards been found to be\nfundamentally wrong, for example, the Leibnitz-Wolfian Philosophy,\nPtolemaic Astronomy, Stahl’s Chemistry, Newton’s Theory of Colours, &c.\n&c.(15)",

    "page_content": "_certainty_ is to be attained, how _judgments __ are to be established_,\nwhat constitutes _rational knowledge_, (_wissen_), and _science_, which we\nrank with language and deliberate action as the third great benefit\nconferred by reason.\n\nReason is feminine in nature; it can only give after it has received. Of\nitself it has nothing but the empty forms of its operation. There is no\nabsolutely pure rational knowledge except the four principles to which I\nhave attributed metalogical truth; the principles of identity,\ncontradiction, excluded middle, and sufficient reason of knowledge. For\neven the rest of logic is not absolutely pure rational knowledge. It\npresupposes the relations and the combinations of the spheres of concepts.\nBut concepts in general only exist after experience of ideas of\nperception, and as their whole nature consists in their relation to these,\nit is clear that they presuppose them. No special content, however, is\npresupposed, but merely the existence of a content generally, and so logic\nas a whole may fairly pass for pure rational science. In all other\nsciences reason has received its content from ideas of perception; in\nmathematics from the relations of space and time, presented in intuition\nor perception prior to all experience; in pure natural science, that is,\nin what we know of the course of nature prior to any experience, the\ncontent of the science proceeds from the pure understanding, _i.e._, from\nthe _a priori_ knowledge of the law of causality and its connection with\nthose pure intuitions or perceptions of space and time. In all other\nsciences everything that is not derived from the sources we have just\nreferred to belongs to experience. Speaking generally, _to know\nrationally_ (_wissen_) means to have in the power of the mind, and capable\nof being reproduced at will, such judgments as have their sufficient\nground of knowledge in something outside themselves, _i.e._, are true.\nThus only abstract cognition is _rational knowledge_ (_wissen_), which is\ntherefore the result of reason, so that we cannot accurately say of the\nlower animals that they _rationally __ know_ (_wissen_) anything, although\nthey have apprehension of what is presented in perception, and memory of\nthis, and consequently imagination, which is further proved by the\ncircumstance that they dream. We attribute consciousness to them, and\ntherefore although the word (_bewusstsein_) is derived from the verb to\nknow rationally (_wissen_), the conception of consciousness corresponds\ngenerally with that of idea of whatever kind it may be. Thus we attribute\nlife to plants, but not consciousness. _Rational knowledge_ (_wissen_) is\ntherefore abstract consciousness, the permanent possession in concepts of\nthe reason, of what has become known in another way.",

    "page_content": "feeling, and therefore we must insert the explanation of feeling here. The\nconcept which the word feeling denotes has merely a negative content,\nwhich is this, that something which is present in consciousness, _is not a\nconcept_, _is not abstract rational knowledge_. Except this, whatever it\nmay be, it comes under the concept of _feeling_. Thus the immeasurably\nwide sphere of the concept of feeling includes the most different kinds of\nobjects, and no one can ever understand how they come together until he\nhas recognised that they all agree in this negative respect, that they are\nnot _abstract concepts_. For the most diverse and even antagonistic\nelements lie quietly side by side in this concept; for example, religious\nfeeling, feeling of sensual pleasure, moral feeling, bodily feeling, as\ntouch, pain, sense of colour, of sounds and their harmonies and discords,\nfeeling of hate, of disgust, of self-satisfaction, of honour, of disgrace,\nof right, of wrong, sense of truth, æsthetic feeling, feeling of power,\nweakness, health, friendship, love, &c. &c. There is absolutely nothing in\ncommon among them except the negative quality that they are not abstract\nrational knowledge. But this diversity becomes more striking when the\napprehension of space relations presented _a priori_ in perception, and\nalso the knowledge of the pure understanding is brought under this\nconcept, and when we say of all knowledge and all truth, of which we are\nfirst conscious only intuitively, and have not yet formulated in abstract\nconcepts, we _feel_ it. I should like, for the sake of illustration, to\ngive some examples of this taken from recent books, as they are striking\nproofs of my theory. I remember reading in the introduction to a German\ntranslation of Euclid, that we ought to make beginners in geometry draw\nthe figures before proceeding to demonstrate, for in this way they would\nalready feel geometrical truth before the demonstration brought them\ncomplete knowledge. In the same way Schleiermacher speaks in his “Critique\nof Ethics” of logical and mathematical feeling (p. 339), and also of the\nfeeling of the sameness or difference of two formulas (p. 342). Again\nTennemann in his “History of Philosophy” (vol. I., p. 361) says, “One\n_felt_ that the fallacies were not right, but could not point out the\nmistakes.” Now, so long as we do not regard this concept “_feeling_” from\nthe right point of view, and do not recognise that one negative\ncharacteristic which alone is essential to it, it must constantly give\noccasion for misunderstanding and controversy, on account of the excessive\nwideness of its sphere, and its entirely negative and very limited content\nwhich is determined in a purely one-sided manner. Since then we have in\nGerman the nearly synonymous word _empfindung_ (sensation), it would be\nconvenient to make use of it for bodily feeling, as a sub-species. This\nconcept “feeling,” which is quite out of proportion to all others,\ndoubtless originated in the following manner. All concepts, and concepts\nalone, are denoted by words; they exist only for the reason, and proceed\nfrom it. With concepts, therefore, we are already at a one-sided point of\nview; but from such a point of view what is near appears distinct and is\nset down as positive, what is farther off becomes mixed up and is soon\nregarded as merely negative. Thus each nation calls all others foreign: to\nthe Greek all others are barbarians; to the Englishman all that is not\nEngland or English is continent or continental; to the believer all others\nare heretics, or heathens; to the noble all others are _roturiers_; to the\nstudent all others are Philistines, and so forth. Now, reason itself,\nstrange as it may seem, is guilty of the same one-sidedness, indeed one\nmight say of the same crude ignorance arising from vanity, for it classes\nunder the one concept, “_feeling_,” every modification of consciousness\nwhich does not immediately belong to its own mode of apprehension, that is\nto say, which is _not an abstract concept_. It has had to pay the penalty\nof this hitherto in misunderstanding and confusion in its own province,\nbecause its own procedure had not become clear to it through thorough\nself-knowledge, for a special faculty of feeling has been set up, and new\ntheories of it are constructed.",

    "page_content": "is, the knowledge which is peculiar to the reason as distinguished from\nthe understanding. Its contradictory opposite has just been explained to\nbe the concept “feeling.” Now, as reason only reproduces, for knowledge,\nwhat has been received in another way, it does not actually extend our\nknowledge, but only gives it another form. It enables us to know in the\nabstract and generally, what first became known in sense-perception, in\nthe concrete. But this is much more important than it appears at first\nsight when so expressed. For it depends entirely upon the fact that\nknowledge has become rational or abstract knowledge (_wissen_), that it\ncan be safely preserved, that it is communicable and susceptible of\ncertain and wide-reaching application to practice. Knowledge in the form\nof sense-perception is valid only of the particular case, extends only to\nwhat is nearest, and ends with it, for sensibility and understanding can\nonly comprehend one object at a time. Every enduring, arranged, and\nplanned activity must therefore proceed from principles,—that is, from\nabstract knowledge, and it must be conducted in accordance with them.\nThus, for example, the knowledge of the relation of cause and effect\narrived at by the understanding, is in itself far completer, deeper and\nmore exhaustive than anything that can be thought about it in the\nabstract; the understanding alone knows in perception directly and\ncompletely the nature of the effect of a lever, of a pulley, or a\ncog-wheel, the stability of an arch, and so forth. But on account of the\npeculiarity of the knowledge of perception just referred to, that it only\nextends to what is immediately present, the mere understanding can never\nenable us to construct machines and buildings. Here reason must come in;\nit must substitute abstract concepts for ideas of perception, and take\nthem as the guide of action; and if they are right, the anticipated result\nwill happen. In the same way we have perfect knowledge in pure perception\nof the nature and constitution of the parabola, hyperbola, and spiral; but\nif we are to make trustworthy application of this knowledge to the real,\nit must first become abstract knowledge, and by this it certainly loses\nits character of intuition or perception, but on the other hand it gains\nthe certainty and preciseness of abstract knowledge. The differential\ncalculus does not really extend our knowledge of the curve, it contains\nnothing that was not already in the mere pure perception of the curve; but\nit alters the kind of knowledge, it changes the intuitive into an abstract\nknowledge, which is so valuable for application. But here we must refer to\nanother peculiarity of our faculty of knowledge, which could not be\nobserved until the distinction between the knowledge of the senses and\nunderstanding and abstract knowledge had been made quite clear. It is\nthis, that relations of space cannot as such be directly translated into\nabstract knowledge, but only temporal quantities,—that is, numbers, are\nsuitable for this. Numbers alone can be expressed in abstract concepts\nwhich accurately correspond to them, not spacial quantities. The concept\n“thousand” is just as different from the concept “ten,” as both these\ntemporal quantities are in perception. We think of a thousand as a\ndistinct multiple of ten, into which we can resolve it at pleasure for\nperception in time,—that is to say, we can count it. But between the\nabstract concept of a mile and that of a foot, apart from any concrete\nperception of either, and without the help of number, there is no accurate\ndistinction corresponding to the quantities themselves. In both we only\nthink of a spacial quantity in general, and if they must be completely\ndistinguished we are compelled either to call in the assistance of\nintuition or perception in space, which would be a departure from abstract\nknowledge, or we must think the difference in _numbers_. If then we wish\nto have abstract knowledge of space-relations we must first translate them\ninto time-relations,—that is, into numbers; therefore only arithmetic, and\nnot geometry, is the universal science of quantity, and geometry must be\ntranslated into arithmetic if it is to be communicable, accurately precise\nand applicable in practice. It is true that a space-relation as such may\nalso be thought in the abstract; for example, “the sine increases as the\nangle,” but if the quantity of this relation is to be given, it requires\nnumber for its expression. This necessity, that if we wish to have\nabstract knowledge of space-relations (_i.e._, rational knowledge, not\nmere intuition or perception), space with its three dimensions must be\ntranslated into time which has only one dimension, this necessity it is,\nwhich makes mathematics so difficult. This becomes very clear if we\ncompare the perception of curves with their analytical calculation, or the\ntable of logarithms of the trigonometrical functions with the perception\nof the changing relations of the parts of a triangle, which are expressed\nby them. What vast mazes of figures, what laborious calculations it would\nrequire to express in the abstract what perception here apprehends at a\nglance completely and with perfect accuracy, namely, how the co-sine\ndiminishes as the sine increases, how the co-sine of one angle is the sine\nof another, the inverse relation of the increase and decrease of the two\nangles, and so forth. How time, we might say, must complain, that with its\none dimension it should be compelled to express the three dimensions of\nspace! Yet this is necessary if we wish to possess, for application, an\nexpression, in abstract concepts, of space-relations. They could not be\ntranslated directly into abstract concepts, but only through the medium of\nthe pure temporal quantity, number, which alone is directly related to\nabstract knowledge. Yet it is worthy of remark, that as space adapts\nitself so well to perception, and by means of its three dimensions, even\nits complicated relations are easily apprehended, while it eludes the\ngrasp of abstract knowledge; time, on the contrary, passes easily into\nabstract knowledge, but gives very little to perception. Our perceptions\nof numbers in their proper element, mere time, without the help of space,\nscarcely extends as far as ten, and beyond that we have only abstract\nconcepts of numbers, no knowledge of them which can be presented in\nperception. On the other hand, we connect with every numeral, and with all\nalgebraical symbols, accurately defined abstract concepts.\n\nWe may further remark here that some minds only find full satisfaction in\nwhat is known through perception. What they seek is the reason and\nconsequent of being in space, sensuously expressed; a demonstration after\nthe manner of Euclid, or an arithmetical solution of spacial problems,\ndoes not please them. Other minds, on the contrary, seek merely the\nabstract concepts which are needful for applying and communicating\nknowledge. They have patience and memory for abstract principles,\nformulas, demonstrations in long trains of reasoning, and calculations, in\nwhich the symbols represent the most complicated abstractions. The latter\nseek preciseness, the former sensible perception. The difference is\ncharacteristic.\n\nThe greatest value of rational or abstract knowledge is that it can be\ncommunicated and permanently retained. It is principally on this account\nthat it is so inestimably important for practice. Any one may have a\ndirect perceptive knowledge through the understanding alone, of the causal\nconnection, of the changes and motions of natural bodies, and he may find\nentire satisfaction in it; but he cannot communicate this knowledge to\nothers until it has been made permanent for thought in concepts. Knowledge\nof the first kind is even sufficient for practice, if a man puts his\nknowledge into practice himself, in an action which can be accomplished\nwhile the perception is still vivid; but it is not sufficient if the help\nof others is required, or even if the action is his own but must be\ncarried out at different times, and therefore requires a pre-conceived\nplan. Thus, for example, a practised billiard-player may have a perfect\nknowledge of the laws of the impact of elastic bodies upon each other,\nmerely in the understanding, merely for direct perception; and for him it\nis quite sufficient; but on the other hand it is only the man who has\nstudied the science of mechanics, who has, properly speaking, a rational\nknowledge of these laws, that is, a knowledge of them in the abstract.\nSuch knowledge of the understanding in perception is sufficient even for\nthe construction of machines, when the inventor of the machine executes\nthe work himself; as we often see in the case of talented workmen, who\nhave no scientific knowledge. But whenever a number of men, and their\nunited action taking place at different times, is required for the\ncompletion of a mechanical work, of a machine, or a building, then he who\nconducts it must have thought out the plan in the abstract, and such\nco-operative activity is only possible through the assistance of reason.\nIt is, however, remarkable that in the first kind of activity, in which we\nhave supposed that one man alone, in an uninterrupted course of action,\naccomplishes something, abstract knowledge, the application of reason or\nreflection, may often be a hindrance to him; for example, in the case of\nbilliard-playing, of fighting, of tuning an instrument, or in the case of\nsinging. Here perceptive knowledge must directly guide action; its passage\nthrough reflection makes it uncertain, for it divides the attention and\nconfuses the man. Thus savages and untaught men, who are little accustomed\nto think, perform certain physical exercises, fight with beasts, shoot\nwith bows and arrows and the like, with a certainty and rapidity which the\nreflecting European never attains to, just because his deliberation makes\nhim hesitate and delay. For he tries, for example, to hit the right\nposition or the right point of time, by finding out the mean between two\nfalse extremes; while the savage hits it directly without thinking of the\nfalse courses open to him. In the same way it is of no use to me to know\nin the abstract the exact angle, in degrees and minutes, at which I must\napply a razor, if I do not know it intuitively, that is, if I have not got\nit in my touch. The knowledge of physiognomy also, is interfered with by\nthe application of reason. This knowledge must be gained directly through\nthe understanding. We say that the expression, the meaning of the\nfeatures, can only be _felt_, that is, it cannot be put into abstract\nconcepts. Every man has his direct intuitive method of physiognomy and\npathognomy, yet one man understands more clearly than another these\n_signatura rerum_. But an abstract science of physiognomy to be taught and\nlearned is not possible; for the distinctions of difference are here so\nfine that concepts cannot reach them; therefore abstract knowledge is\nrelated to them as a mosaic is to a painting by a Van der Werft or a\nDenner. In mosaics, however fine they may be, the limits of the stones are\nalways there, and therefore no continuous passage from one colour to\nanother is possible, and this is also the case with regard to concepts,\nwith their rigidity and sharp delineation; however finely we may divide\nthem by exact definition, they are still incapable of reaching the finer\nmodifications of the perceptible, and this is just what happens in the\nexample we have taken, knowledge of physiognomy.(16)\n\nThis quality of concepts by which they resemble the stones of a mosaic,\nand on account of which perception always remains their asymptote, is also\nthe reason why nothing good is produced in art by their means. If the\nsinger or the virtuoso attempts to guide his execution by reflection he\nremains silent. And this is equally true of the composer, the painter, and\nthe poet. The concept always remains unfruitful in art; it can only direct\nthe technical part of it, its sphere is science. We shall consider more\nfully in the third book, why all true art proceeds from sensuous\nknowledge, never from the concept. Indeed, with regard to behaviour also,\nand personal agreeableness in society, the concept has only a negative\nvalue in restraining the grosser manifestations of egotism and brutality;\nso that a polished manner is its commendable production. But all that is\nattractive, gracious, charming in behaviour, all affectionateness and\nfriendliness, must not proceed from the concepts, for if it does, “we feel\nintention, and are put out of tune.” All dissimulation is the work of\nreflection; but it cannot be maintained constantly and without\ninterruption: “_nemo __ potest personam diu ferre fictum_,” says Seneca in\nhis book _de clementia_; and so it is generally found out and loses its\neffect. Reason is needed in the full stress of life, where quick\nconclusions, bold action, rapid and sure comprehension are required, but\nit may easily spoil all if it gains the upper hand, and by perplexing\nhinders the intuitive, direct discovery, and grasp of the right by simple\nunderstanding, and thus induces irresolution.\n\nLastly, virtue and holiness do not proceed from reflection, but from the\ninner depths of the will, and its relation to knowledge. The exposition of\nthis belongs to another part of our work; this, however, I may remark\nhere, that the dogmas relating to ethics may be the same in the reason of\nwhole nations, but the action of every individual different; and the\nconverse also holds good; action, we say, is guided by _feelings_,—that\nis, simply not by concepts, but as a matter of fact by the ethical\ncharacter. Dogmas occupy the idle reason; but action in the end pursues\nits own course independently of them, generally not according to abstract\nrules, but according to unspoken maxims, the expression of which is the\nwhole man himself. Therefore, however different the religious dogmas of\nnations may be, yet in the case of all of them, a good action is\naccompanied by unspeakable satisfaction, and a bad action by endless\nremorse. No mockery can shake the former; no priest’s absolution can\ndeliver from the latter. Notwithstanding this, we must allow, that for the\npursuit of a virtuous life, the application of reason is needful; only it\nis not its source, but has the subordinate function of preserving\nresolutions which have been made, of providing maxims to withstand the\nweakness of the moment, and give consistency to action. It plays the same\npart ultimately in art also, where it has just as little to do with the\nessential matter, but assists in carrying it out, for genius is not always\nat call, and yet the work must be completed in all its parts and rounded\noff to a whole.(17)",

    "page_content": "application of reason are intended to show, that although abstract\nrational knowledge is the reflex of ideas of perception, and is founded on\nthem, it is by no means in such entire congruity with them that it could\neverywhere take their place: indeed it never corresponds to them quite\naccurately. And thus, as we have seen, many human actions can only be\nperformed by the help of reason and deliberation, and yet there are some\nwhich are better performed without its assistance. This very incongruity\nof sensuous and abstract knowledge, on account of which the latter always\nmerely approximates to the former, as mosaic approximates to painting, is\nthe cause of a very remarkable phenomenon which, like reason itself, is\npeculiar to human nature, and of which the explanations that have ever\nanew been attempted, are insufficient: I mean _laughter_. On account of\nthe source of this phenomenon, we cannot avoid giving the explanation of\nit here, though it again interrupts the course of our work to do so. The\ncause of laughter in every case is simply the sudden perception of the\nincongruity between a concept and the real objects which have been thought\nthrough it in some relation, and laughter itself is just the expression of\nthis incongruity. It often occurs in this way: two or more real objects\nare thought through _one_ concept, and the identity of the concept is\ntransferred to the objects; it then becomes strikingly apparent from the\nentire difference of the objects in other respects, that the concept was\nonly applicable to them from a one-sided point of view. It occurs just as\noften, however, that the incongruity between a single real object and the\nconcept under which, from one point of view, it has rightly been subsumed,\nis suddenly felt. Now the more correct the subsumption of such objects\nunder a concept may be from one point of view, and the greater and more\nglaring their incongruity with it, from another point of view, the greater\nis the ludicrous effect which is produced by this contrast. All laughter\nthen is occasioned by a paradox, and therefore by unexpected subsumption,\nwhether this is expressed in words or in actions. This, briefly stated, is\nthe true explanation of the ludicrous.\n\nI shall not pause here to relate anecdotes as examples to illustrate my\ntheory; for it is so simple and comprehensible that it does not require\nthem, and everything ludicrous which the reader may remember is equally\nvaluable as a proof of it. But the theory is confirmed and illustrated by\ndistinguishing two species into which the ludicrous is divided, and which\nresult from the theory. Either, we have previously known two or more very\ndifferent real objects, ideas of sense-perception, and have intentionally\nidentified them through the unity of a concept which comprehends them\nboth; this species of the ludicrous is called _wit_. Or, conversely, the\nconcept is first present in knowledge, and we pass from it to reality, and\nto operation upon it, to action: objects which in other respects are\nfundamentally different, but which are all thought in that one concept,\nare now regarded and treated in the same way, till, to the surprise and\nastonishment of the person acting, the great difference of their other\naspects appears: this species of the ludicrous is called _folly_.\nTherefore everything ludicrous is either a flash of wit or a foolish\naction, according as the procedure has been from the discrepancy of the\nobjects to the identity of the concept, or the converse; the former always\nintentional, the latter always unintentional, and from without. To seem to\nreverse the starting-point, and to conceal wit with the mask of folly, is\nthe art of the jester and the clown. Being quite aware of the diversity of\nthe objects, the jester unites them, with secret wit, under one concept,\nand then starting from this concept he receives from the subsequently\ndiscovered diversity of the objects the surprise which he himself\nprepared. It follows from this short but sufficient theory of the\nludicrous, that, if we set aside the last case, that of the jester, wit\nmust always show itself in words, folly generally in actions, though also\nin words, when it only expresses an intention and does not actually carry\nit out, or when it shows itself merely in judgments and opinions.\n\n_Pedantry_ is a form of folly. It arises in this way: a man lacks\nconfidence in his own understanding, and, therefore, does not wish to\ntrust to it, to recognise what is right directly in the particular case.\nHe, therefore, puts it entirely under the control of the reason, and seeks\nto be guided by reason in everything; that is to say, he tries always to\nproceed from general concepts, rules, and maxims, and to confine himself\nstrictly to them in life, in art, and even in moral conduct. Hence that\nclinging to the form, to the manner, to the expression and word which is\ncharacteristic of pedantry, and which with it takes the place of the real\nnature of the matter. The incongruity then between the concept and reality\nsoon shows itself here, and it becomes evident that the former never\ncondescends to the particular case, and that with its generality and rigid\ndefiniteness it can never accurately apply to the fine distinctions of\ndifference and innumerable modifications of the actual. Therefore, the\npedant, with his general maxims, almost always misses the mark in life,\nshows himself to be foolish, awkward, useless. In art, in which the\nconcept is unfruitful, he produces lifeless, stiff, abortive mannerisms.\nEven with regard to ethics, the purpose to act rightly or nobly cannot\nalways be carried out in accordance with abstract maxims; for in many\ncases the excessively nice distinctions in the nature of the circumstances\nnecessitate a choice of the right proceeding directly from the character;\nfor the application of mere abstract maxims sometimes gives false results,\nbecause the maxims only half apply; and sometimes cannot be carried out,\nbecause they are foreign to the individual character of the actor, and\nthis never allows itself to be entirely discovered; therefore,\ninconsistencies arise. Since then Kant makes it a condition of the moral\nworth of an action, that it shall proceed from pure rational abstract\nmaxims, without any inclination or momentary emotion, we cannot entirely\nabsolve him from the reproach of encouraging moral pedantry. This reproach\nis the significance of Schiller’s epigram, entitled “Scruples of\nConscience.” When we speak, especially in connection with politics, of\ndoctrinaires, theorists, savants, and so forth, we mean pedants, that is,\npersons who know the things well in the abstract, but not in the concrete.\nAbstraction consists in thinking away the less general predicates; but it\nis precisely upon these that so much depends in practice.\n\nTo complete our theory it remains for us to mention a spurious kind of\nwit, the play upon words, the _calembourg_, the pun, to which may be added\nthe equivocation, the _double entendre_, the chief use of which is the\nexpression of what is obscene. Just as the witticism brings two very\ndifferent real objects under one concept, the pun brings two different\nconcepts, by the assistance of accident, under one word. The same contrast\nappears, only familiar and more superficial, because it does not spring\nfrom the nature of things, but merely from the accident of nomenclature.\nIn the case of the witticism the identity is in the concept, the\ndifference in the reality, but in the case of the pun the difference is in\nthe concepts and the identity in the reality, for the terminology is here\nthe reality. It would only be a somewhat far-fetched comparison if we were\nto say that the pun is related to the witticism as the parabola (_sic_) of\nthe upper inverted cone to that of the lower. The misunderstanding of the\nword or the _quid pro quo_ is the unintentional pun, and is related to it\nexactly as folly is to wit. Thus the deaf man often affords occasion for\nlaughter, just as much as the fool, and inferior writers of comedy often\nuse the former for the latter to raise a laugh.\n\nI have treated laughter here only from the psychical side; with regard to\nthe physical side, I refer to what is said on the subject in the\n“Parerga,” vol. II. ch. vi.,",

    "page_content": "difference and the relation between the process of knowledge that belongs\nto the reason, rational knowledge, the concept on the one hand, and the\ndirect knowledge in purely sensuous, mathematical intuition or perception,\nand apprehension by the understanding on the other hand, has been clearly\nbrought out. This remarkable relation of our kinds of knowledge led us\nalmost inevitably to give, in passing, explanations of feeling and of\nlaughter, but from all this we now turn back to the further consideration\nof science as the third great benefit which reason confers on man, the\nother two being speech and deliberate action. The general discussion of\nscience which now devolves upon us, will be concerned partly with its\nform, partly with the foundation of its judgments, and lastly with its\ncontent.\n\nWe have seen that, with the exception of the basis of pure logic, rational\nknowledge in general has not its source in the reason itself; but having\nbeen otherwise obtained as knowledge of perception, it is stored up in the\nreason, for through reason it has entirely changed its character, and has\nbecome abstract knowledge. All rational knowledge, that is, knowledge that\nhas been raised to consciousness in the abstract, is related to science\nstrictly so called, as a fragment to the whole. Every one has gained a\nrational knowledge of many different things through experience, through\nconsideration of the individual objects presented to him, but only he who\nsets himself the task of acquiring a complete knowledge in the abstract of\na particular class of objects, strives after science. This class can only\nbe marked off by means of a concept; therefore, at the beginning of every\nscience there stands a concept, and by means of it the class of objects\nconcerning which this science promises a complete knowledge in the\nabstract, is separated in thought from the whole world of things. For\nexample, the concept of space-relations, or of the action of unorganised\nbodies upon each other, or of the nature of plants, or of animals, or of\nthe successive changes of the surface of the globe, or of the changes of\nthe human race as a whole, or of the construction of a language, and so\nforth. If science sought to obtain the knowledge of its object, by\ninvestigating each individual thing that is thought through the concept,\ntill by degrees it had learned the whole, no human memory would be equal\nto the task, and no certainty of completeness would be obtainable.\nTherefore, it makes use of that property of concept-spheres explained\nabove, that they include each other, and it concerns itself mainly with\nthe wider spheres which lie within the concept of its object in general.\nWhen the relations of these spheres to each other have been determined,\nall that is thought in them is also generally determined, and can now be\nmore and more accurately determined by the separation of smaller and\nsmaller concept-spheres. In this way it is possible for a science to\ncomprehend its object completely. This path which it follows to knowledge,\nthe path from the general to the particular, distinguishes it from\nordinary rational knowledge; therefore, systematic form is an essential\nand characteristic feature of science. The combination of the most general\nconcept-spheres of every science, that is, the knowledge of its first\nprinciples, is the indispensable condition of mastering it; how far we\nadvance from these to the more special propositions is a matter of choice,\nand does not increase the thoroughness but only the extent of our\nknowledge of the science. The number of the first principles to which all\nthe rest are subordinated, varies greatly in the different sciences, so\nthat in some there is more subordination, in others more co-ordination;\nand in this respect, the former make greater claims upon the judgment, the\nlatter upon the memory. It was known to the schoolmen,(19) that, as the\nsyllogism requires two premises, no science can proceed from a single\nfirst principle which cannot be the subject of further deduction, but must\nhave several, at least two. The specially classifying sciences: Zoology,\nBotany, and also Physics and Chemistry, inasmuch as they refer all\ninorganic action to a few fundamental forces, have most subordination;\nhistory, on the other hand, has really none at all; for the general in it\nconsists merely in the survey of the principal periods, from which,\nhowever, the particular events cannot be deduced, and are only\nsubordinated to them according to time, but according to the concept are\nco-ordinate with them. Therefore, history, strictly speaking, is certainly\nrational knowledge, but is not science. In mathematics, according to\nEuclid’s treatment, the axioms alone are indemonstrable first principles,\nand all demonstrations are in gradation strictly subordinated to them. But\nthis method of treatment is not essential to mathematics, and in fact each\nproposition introduces quite a new space construction, which in itself is\nindependent of those which precede it, and indeed can be completely\ncomprehended from itself, quite independently of them, in the pure\nintuition or perception of space, in which the most complicated\nconstruction is just as directly evident as the axiom; but of this more\nfully hereafter. Meanwhile every mathematical proposition remains always a\nuniversal truth, which is valid for innumerable particular cases; and a\ngraduated process from the simple to the complicated propositions which\nare to be deduced from them, is also essential to mathematics; therefore,\nin every respect mathematics is a science. The completeness of a science\nas such, that is, in respect of form, consists in there being as much\nsubordination and as little co-ordination of the principles as possible.\nScientific talent in general is, therefore, the faculty of subordinating\nthe concept-spheres according to their different determinations, so that,\nas Plato repeatedly counsels, a science shall not be constituted by a\ngeneral concept and an indefinite multiplicity immediately under it, but\nthat knowledge shall descend by degrees from the general to the\nparticular, through intermediate concepts and divisions, according to\ncloser and closer definitions. In Kantian language this is called\nsatisfying equally the law of homogeneity and that of specification. It\narises from this peculiar nature of scientific completeness, that the aim\nof science is not greater certainty—for certainty may be possessed in just\nas high a degree by the most disconnected particular knowledge—but its aim\nis rather the facilitating of rational knowledge by means of its form, and\nthe possibility of the completeness of rational knowledge which this form\naffords. It is therefore a very prevalent but perverted opinion that the\nscientific character of knowledge consists in its greater certainty, and\njust as false is the conclusion following from this, that, strictly\nspeaking, the only sciences are mathematics and logic, because only in\nthem, on account of their purely _a priori_ character, is there\nunassailable certainty of knowledge. This advantage cannot be denied them,\nbut it gives them no special claim to be regarded as sciences; for the\nspecial characteristic of science does not lie in certainty but in the\nsystematic form of knowledge, based on the gradual descent from the\ngeneral to the particular. The process of knowledge from the general to\nthe particular, which is peculiar to the sciences, involves the necessity\nthat in the sciences much should be established by deduction from\npreceding propositions, that is to say, by demonstration; and this has\ngiven rise to the old mistake that only what has been demonstrated is\nabsolutely true, and that every truth requires a demonstration; whereas,\non the contrary, every demonstration requires an undemonstrated truth,\nwhich ultimately supports it, or it may be, its own demonstration.\nTherefore a directly established truth is as much to be preferred to a\ntruth established by demonstration as water from the spring is to water\nfrom the aqueduct. Perception, partly pure _a priori_, as it forms the\nbasis of mathematics, partly empirical _a posteriori_, as it forms the\nbasis of all the other sciences, is the source of all truth and the\nfoundation of all science. (Logic alone is to be excepted, which is not\nfounded upon perception but yet upon _direct_ knowledge by the reason of\nits own laws.) Not the demonstrated judgments nor their demonstrations,\nbut judgments which are created directly out of perception, and founded\nupon it rather than on any demonstrations, are to science what the sun is\nto the world; for all light proceeds from them, and lighted by their light\nthe others give light also. To establish the truth of such primary\njudgments directly from perception, to raise such strongholds of science\nfrom the innumerable multitude of real objects, that is the work of the\n_faculty of judgment_, which consists in the power of rightly and\naccurately carrying over into abstract consciousness what is known in\nperception, and judgment is consequently the mediator between\nunderstanding and reason. Only extraordinary and exceptional strength of\njudgment in the individual can actually advance science; but every one who\nis possessed of a healthy reason is able to deduce propositions from\npropositions, to demonstrate, to draw conclusions. To lay down and make\npermanent for reflection, in suitable concepts, what is known through\nperception, so that, on the one hand, what is common to many real objects\nis thought through _one_ concept, and, on the other hand, their points of\ndifference are each thought through one concept, so that the different\nshall be known and thought as different in spite of a partial agreement,\nand the identical shall be known and thought as identical in spite of a\npartial difference, all in accordance with the end and intention which in\neach case is in view; all this is done by the _faculty of judgment_.\nDeficiency in judgment is _silliness_. The silly man fails to grasp, now\nthe partial or relative difference of concepts which in one aspect are\nidentical, now the identity of concepts which are relatively or partially\ndifferent. To this explanation of the faculty of judgment, moreover,\nKant’s division of it into reflecting and subsuming judgment may be\napplied, according as it passes from the perceived objects to the\nconcepts, or from the latter to the former; in both cases always mediating\nbetween empirical knowledge of the understanding and the reflective\nknowledge of the reason. There can be no truth which could be brought out\nby means of syllogisms alone; and the necessity of establishing truth by\nmeans of syllogisms is merely relative, indeed subjective. Since all\ndemonstration is syllogistic, in the case of a new truth we must first\nseek, not for a demonstration, but for direct evidence, and only in the\nabsence of such evidence is a demonstration to be temporarily made use of.\nNo science is susceptible of demonstration throughout any more than a\nbuilding can stand in the air; all its demonstrations must ultimately rest\nupon what is perceived, and consequently cannot be demonstrated, for the\nwhole world of reflection rests upon and is rooted in the world of\nperception. All primal, that is, original, _evidence_ is a _perception_,\nas the word itself indicates. Therefore it is either empirical or founded\nupon the perception _a priori_ of the conditions of possible experience.\nIn both cases it affords only immanent, not transcendent knowledge. Every\nconcept has its worth and its existence only in its relation, sometimes\nvery indirect, to an idea of perception; what is true of the concepts is\nalso true of the judgments constructed out of them, and of all science.\nTherefore it must in some way be possible to know directly without\ndemonstrations or syllogisms every truth that is arrived at through\nsyllogisms and communicated by demonstrations. This is most difficult in\nthe case of certain complicated mathematical propositions at which we only\narrive by chains of syllogisms; for example, the calculation of the chords\nand tangents to all arcs by deduction from the proposition of Pythagoras.\nBut even such a truth as this cannot essentially and solely rest upon\nabstract principles, and the space-relations which lie at its foundation\nalso must be capable of being so presented _a priori_ in pure intuition or\nperception that the truth of their abstract expression is directly\nestablished. But of mathematical demonstration we shall speak more fully\nshortly.\n\nIt is true we often hear men speak in a lofty strain of sciences which\nrest entirely upon correct conclusions drawn from sure premises, and which\nare consequently unassailable. But through pure logical reasoning, however\ntrue the premises may be, we shall never receive more than an articulate\nexpression and exposition of what lies already complete in the premises;\nthus we shall only _explicitly_ expound what was already _implicitly_\nunderstood. The esteemed sciences referred to are, however, specially the\nmathematical sciences, particularly astronomy. But the certainty of\nastronomy arises from the fact that it has for its basis the intuition or\nperception of space, which is given _a priori_, and is therefore\ninfallible. All space-relations, however, follow from each other with a\nnecessity (ground of being) which affords _a priori_ certainty, and they\ncan therefore be safely deduced from each other. To these mathematical\nproperties we have only to add one force of nature, gravity, which acts\nprecisely in relation to the masses and the square of the distance; and,\nlastly, the law of inertia, which follows from the law of causality and is\ntherefore true _a priori_, and with it the empirical datum of the motion\nimpressed, once for all, upon each of these masses. This is the whole\nmaterial of astronomy, which both by its simplicity and its certainty\nleads to definite results, which are highly interesting on account of the\nvastness and importance of the objects. For example, if I know the mass of\na planet and the distance of its satellite from it, I can tell with\ncertainty the period of the revolution of the latter according to Kepler’s\nsecond law. But the ground of this law is, that with this distance only\nthis velocity will both chain the satellite to the planet and prevent it\nfrom falling into it. Thus it is only upon such a geometrical basis, that\nis, by means of an intuition or perception _a priori_, and also under the\napplication of a law of nature, that much can be arrived at by means of\nsyllogisms, for here they are merely like bridges from _one_ sensuous\napprehension to others; but it is not so with mere pure syllogistic\nreasoning in the exclusively logical method. The source of the first\nfundamental truths of astronomy is, however, properly induction, that is,\nthe comprehension of what is given in many perceptions in one true and\ndirectly founded judgment. From this, hypotheses are afterwards\nconstructed, and their confirmation by experience, as induction\napproaching to completeness, affords the proof of the first judgment. For\nexample, the apparent motion of the planets is known empirically; after\nmany false hypotheses with regard to the spacial connection of this motion\n(planetary course) the right one was at last found, then the laws which it\nobeyed (the laws of Kepler), and, lastly, the cause of these laws\n(universal gravitation), and the empirically known agreement of all\nobserved cases with the whole of the hypotheses, and with their\nconsequences, that is to say, induction, established them with complete\ncertainty. The invention of the hypotheses was the work of the judgment,\nwhich rightly comprehended the given facts and expressed them accordingly;\nbut induction, that is, a multitude of perceptions, confirmed their truth.\nBut their truth could also be known directly, and by a single empirical\nperception, if we could pass freely through space and had telescopic eyes.\nTherefore, here also syllogisms are not the essential and only source of\nknowledge, but really only a makeshift.\n\nAs a third example taken from a different sphere we may mention that the\nso-called metaphysical truths, that is, such truths as those to which Kant\nassigns the position of the metaphysical first principles of natural\nscience, do not owe their evidence to demonstration. What is _a priori_\ncertain we know directly; as the form of all knowledge, it is known to us\nwith the most complete necessity. For example, that matter is permanent,\nthat is, can neither come into being nor pass away, we know directly as\nnegative truth; for our pure intuition or perception of space and time\ngives the possibility of motion; in the law of causality the understanding\naffords us the possibility of change of form and quality, but we lack\npowers of the imagination for conceiving the coming into being or passing\naway of matter. Therefore that truth has at all times been evident to all\nmen everywhere, nor has it ever been seriously doubted; and this could not\nbe the case if it had no other ground of knowledge than the abstruse and\nexceedingly subtle proof of Kant. But besides this, I have found Kant’s\nproof to be false (as is explained in the Appendix), and have shown above\nthat the permanence of matter is to be deduced, not from the share which\ntime has in the possibility of experience, but from the share which\nbelongs to space. The true foundation of all truths which in this sense\nare called metaphysical, that is, abstract expressions of the necessary\nand universal forms of knowledge, cannot itself lie in abstract\nprinciples; but only in the immediate consciousness of the forms of the\nidea communicating itself in apodictic assertions _a priori_, and fearing\nno refutation. But if we yet desire to give a proof of them, it can only\nconsist in showing that what is to be proved is contained in some truth\nabout which there is no doubt, either as a part of it or as a\npresupposition. Thus, for example, I have shown that all empirical\nperception implies the application of the law of causality, the knowledge\nof which is hence a condition of all experience, and therefore cannot be\nfirst given and conditioned through experience as Hume thought.\nDemonstrations in general are not so much for those who wish to learn as\nfor those who wish to dispute. Such persons stubbornly deny directly\nestablished insight; now only the truth can be consistent in all\ndirections, and therefore we must show such persons that they admit under\n_one_ form and indirectly, what they deny under another form and directly;\nthat is, the logically necessary connection between what is denied and\nwhat is admitted.\n\nIt is also a consequence of the scientific form, the subordination of\neverything particular under a general, and so on always to what is more\ngeneral, that the truth of many propositions is only logically\nproved,—that is, through their dependence upon other propositions, through\nsyllogisms, which at the same time appear as proofs. But we must never\nforget that this whole form of science is merely a means of rendering\nknowledge more easy, not a means to greater certainty. It is easier to\ndiscover the nature of an animal, by means of the species to which it\nbelongs, and so on through the genus, family, order, and class, than to\nexamine on every occasion the animal presented to us: but the truth of all\npropositions arrived at syllogistically is always conditioned by and\nultimately dependent upon some truth which rests not upon reasoning but\nupon perception. If this perception were always as much within our reach\nas a deduction through syllogisms, then it would be in every respect\npreferable. For every deduction from concepts is exposed to great danger\nof error, on account of the fact we have considered above, that so many\nspheres lie partly within each other, and that their content is often\nvague or uncertain. This is illustrated by a multitude of demonstrations\nof false doctrines and sophisms of every kind. Syllogisms are indeed\nperfectly certain as regards form, but they are very uncertain on account\nof their matter, the concepts. For, on the one hand, the spheres of these\nare not sufficiently sharply defined, and, on the other hand, they\nintersect each other in so many ways that one sphere is in part contained\nin many others, and we may pass at will from it to one or another of\nthese, and from this sphere again to others, as we have already shown. Or,\nin other words, the minor term and also the middle can always be\nsubordinated to different concepts, from which we may choose at will the\nmajor and the middle, and the nature of the conclusion depends on this\nchoice. Consequently immediate evidence is always much to be preferred to\nreasoned truth, and the latter is only to be accepted when the former is\ntoo remote, and not when it is as near or indeed nearer than the latter.\nAccordingly we saw above that, as a matter of fact, in the case of logic,\nin which the immediate knowledge in each individual case lies nearer to\nhand than deduced scientific knowledge, we always conduct our thought\naccording to our immediate knowledge of the laws of thought, and leave\nlogic unused.(20)",

This must seem to us like the action of a man who\ncuts off his legs in order to go on crutches, or like that of the prince\nin the “_Triumph der Empfindsamkeit_” who flees from the beautiful reality\nof nature, to delight in a stage scene that imitates it. I must here refer\nto what I have said in the sixth chapter of the essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason, and take for granted that it is fresh and present in\nthe memory of the reader; so that I may link my observations on to it\nwithout explaining again the difference between the mere ground of\nknowledge of a mathematical truth, which can be given logically, and the\nground of being, which is the immediate connection of the parts of space\nand time, known only in perception. It is only insight into the ground of\nbeing that secures satisfaction and thorough knowledge. The mere ground of\nknowledge must always remain superficial; it can afford us indeed rational\nknowledge _that_ a thing is as it is, but it cannot tell _why_ it is so.\nEuclid chose the latter way to the obvious detriment of the science. For\njust at the beginning, for example, when he ought to show once for all how\nin a triangle the angles and sides reciprocally determine each other, and\nstand to each other in the relation of reason and consequent, in\naccordance with the form which the principle of sufficient reason has in\npure space, and which there, as in every other sphere, always affords the\nnecessity that a thing is as it is, because something quite different from\nit, is as it is; instead of in this way giving a thorough insight into the\nnature of the triangle, he sets up certain disconnected arbitrarily chosen\npropositions concerning the triangle, and gives a logical ground of\nknowledge of them, through a laborious logical demonstration, based upon\nthe principle of contradiction. Instead of an exhaustive knowledge of\nthese space-relations we therefore receive merely certain results of them,\nimparted to us at pleasure, and in fact we are very much in the position\nof a man to whom the different effects of an ingenious machine are shown,\nbut from whom its inner connection and construction are withheld. We are\ncompelled by the principle of contradiction to admit that what Euclid\ndemonstrates is true, but we do not comprehend _why_ it is so. We have\ntherefore almost the same uncomfortable feeling that we experience after a\njuggling trick, and, in fact, most of Euclid’s demonstrations are\nremarkably like such feats. The truth almost always enters by the back\ndoor, for it manifests itself _per accidens_ through some contingent\ncircumstance. Often a _reductio ad absurdum_ shuts all the doors one after\nanother, until only one is left through which we are therefore compelled\nto enter. Often, as in the proposition of Pythagoras, lines are drawn, we\ndon’t know why, and it afterwards appears that they were traps which close\nunexpectedly and take prisoner the assent of the astonished learner, who\nmust now admit what remains wholly inconceivable in its inner connection,\nso much so, that he may study the whole of Euclid through and through\nwithout gaining a real insight into the laws of space-relations, but\ninstead of them he only learns by heart certain results which follow from\nthem. This specially empirical and unscientific knowledge is like that of\nthe doctor who knows both the disease and the cure for it, but does not\nknow the connection between them. But all this is the necessary\nconsequence if we capriciously reject the special kind of proof and\nevidence of one species of knowledge, and forcibly introduce in its stead\na kind which is quite foreign to its nature. However, in other respects\nthe manner in which this has been accomplished by Euclid deserves all the\npraise which has been bestowed on him through so many centuries, and which\nhas been carried so far that his method of treating mathematics has been\nset up as the pattern of all scientific exposition. Men tried indeed to\nmodel all the sciences after it, but later they gave up the attempt\nwithout quite knowing why. Yet in our eyes this method of Euclid in\nmathematics can appear only as a very brilliant piece of perversity. But\nwhen a great error in life or in science has been intentionally and\nmethodically carried out with universal applause, it is always possible to\ndiscover its source in the philosophy which prevailed at the time. The\nEleatics first brought out the difference, and indeed often the conflict,\nthat exists between what is perceived, φαινομενον,(21) and what is\nthought, νουμενον, and used it in many ways in their philosophical\nepigrams, and also in sophisms. They were followed later by the Megarics,\nthe Dialecticians, the Sophists, the New-Academy, and the Sceptics; these\ndrew attention to the illusion, that is to say, to the deception of the\nsenses, or rather of the understanding which transforms the data of the\nsenses into perception, and which often causes us to see things to which\nthe reason unhesitatingly denies reality; for example, a stick broken in\nwater, and such like. It came to be known that sense-perception was not to\nbe trusted unconditionally, and it was therefore hastily concluded that\nonly rational, logical thought could establish truth; although Plato (in\nthe Parmenides), the Megarics, Pyrrho, and the New-Academy, showed by\nexamples (in the manner which was afterwards adopted by Sextus Empiricus)\nhow syllogisms and concepts were also sometimes misleading, and indeed\nproduced paralogisms and sophisms which arise much more easily and are far\nharder to explain than the illusion of sense-perception. However, this\nrationalism, which arose in opposition to empiricism, kept the upper hand,\nand Euclid constructed the science of mathematics in accordance with it.\nHe was compelled by necessity to found the axioms upon evidence of\nperception (φαινομενον), but all the rest he based upon reasoning\n(νουμενον). His method reigned supreme through all the succeeding\ncenturies, and it could not but do so as long as pure intuition or\nperception, _a priori_, was not distinguished from empirical perception.\nCertain passages from the works of Proclus, the commentator of Euclid,\nwhich Kepler translated into Latin in his book, “De Harmonia Mundi,” seem\nto show that he fully recognised this distinction. But Proclus did not\nattach enough importance to the matter; he merely mentioned it by the way,\nso that he remained unnoticed and accomplished nothing. Therefore, not\ntill two thousand years later will the doctrine of Kant, which is destined\nto make such great changes in all the knowledge, thought, and action of\nEuropean nations, produce this change in mathematics also. For it is only\nafter we have learned from this great man that the intuitions or\nperceptions of space and time are quite different from empirical\nperceptions, entirely independent of any impression of the senses,\nconditioning it, not conditioned by it, _i.e._, are _a priori_, and\ntherefore are not exposed to the illusions of sense; only after we have\nlearned this, I say, can we comprehend that Euclid’s logical method of\ntreating mathematics is a useless precaution, a crutch for sound legs,\nthat it is like a wanderer who during the night mistakes a bright, firm\nroad for water, and carefully avoiding it, toils over the broken ground\nbeside it, content to keep from point to point along the edge of the\nsupposed water. Only now can we affirm with certainty that what presents\nitself to us as necessary in the perception of a figure, does not come\nfrom the figure on the paper, which is perhaps very defectively drawn, nor\nfrom the abstract concept under which we think it, but immediately from\nthe form of all knowledge of which we are conscious _a priori_. This is\nalways the principle of sufficient reason; here as the form of perception,\n_i.e._, space, it is the principle of the ground of being, the evidence\nand validity of which is, however, just as great and as immediate as that\nof the principle of the ground of knowing, _i.e._, logical certainty. Thus\nwe need not and ought not to leave the peculiar province of mathematics in\norder to put our trust only in logical proof, and seek to authenticate\nmathematics in a sphere which is quite foreign to it, that of concepts. If\nwe confine ourselves to the ground peculiar to mathematics, we gain the\ngreat advantage that in it the rational knowledge _that_ something is, is\none with the knowledge _why_ it is so, whereas the method of Euclid\nentirely separates these two, and lets us know only the first, not the\nsecond. Aristotle says admirably in the Analyt., post. i. 27: “Ακριβεστερα\nδ᾽ επιστημη επιστημης και προτερα, ἡτε του ὁτι και του διοτι ἡ αυτη, αλλα\nμη χωρις του ὁτι, της του διοτι” (_Subtilior autem et praestantior ea est\nscientia, quâ_ QUOD _aliquid sit, et_ CUR _sit una simulque intelligimus\nnon separatim_ QUOD, _et_ CUR _sit_). In physics we are only satisfied\nwhen the knowledge that a thing is as it is is combined with the knowledge\nwhy it is so. To know that the mercury in the Torricellian tube stands\nthirty inches high is not really rational knowledge if we do not know that\nit is sustained at this height by the counterbalancing weight of the\natmosphere. Shall we then be satisfied in mathematics with the _qualitas\nocculta_ of the circle that the segments of any two intersecting chords\nalways contain equal rectangles? That it is so Euclid certainly\ndemonstrates in the 35th Prop. of the Third Book; _why_ it is so remains\ndoubtful. In the same way the proposition of Pythagoras teaches us a\n_qualitas occulta_ of the right-angled triangle; the stilted and indeed\nfallacious demonstration of Euclid forsakes us at the _why_, and a simple\nfigure, which we already know, and which is present to us, gives at a\nglance far more insight into the matter, and firm inner conviction of that\nnecessity, and of the dependence of that quality upon the right angle:—\n\n                              [Illustration]\n\nIn the case of unequal catheti also, and indeed generally in the case of\nevery possible geometrical truth, it is quite possible to obtain such a\nconviction based on perception, because these truths were always\ndiscovered by such an empirically known necessity, and their demonstration\nwas only thought out afterwards in addition. Thus we only require an\nanalysis of the process of thought in the first discovery of a geometrical\ntruth in order to know its necessity empirically. It is the analytical\nmethod in general that I wish for the exposition of mathematics, instead\nof the synthetical method which Euclid made use of. Yet this would have\nvery great, though not insuperable, difficulties in the case of\ncomplicated mathematical truths. Here and there in Germany men are\nbeginning to alter the exposition of mathematics, and to proceed more in\nthis analytical way. The greatest effort in this direction has been made\nby Herr Kosack, teacher of mathematics and physics in the Gymnasium at\nNordhausen, who added a thorough attempt to teach geometry according to my\nprinciples to the programme of the school examination on the 6th of April\n1852.\n\nIn order to improve the method of mathematics, it is especially necessary\nto overcome the prejudice that demonstrated truth has any superiority over\nwhat is known through perception, or that logical truth founded upon the\nprinciple of contradiction has any superiority over metaphysical truth,\nwhich is immediately evident, and to which belongs the pure intuition or\nperception of space.\n\nThat which is most certain, and yet always inexplicable, is what is\ninvolved in the principle of sufficient reason, for this principle, in its\ndifferent aspects, expresses the universal form of all our ideas and\nknowledge. All explanation consists of reduction to it, exemplification in\nthe particular case of the connection of ideas expressed generally through\nit. It is thus the principle of all explanation, and therefore it is\nneither susceptible of an explanation itself, nor does it stand in need of\nit; for every explanation presupposes it, and only obtains meaning through\nit. Now, none of its forms are superior to the rest; it is equally certain\nand incapable of demonstration as the principle of the ground of being, or\nof change, or of action, or of knowing. The relation of reason and\nconsequent is a necessity in all its forms, and indeed it is, in general,\nthe source of the concept of necessity, for necessity has no other\nmeaning. If the reason is given there is no other necessity than that of\nthe consequent, and there is no reason that does not involve the necessity\nof the consequent. Just as surely then as the consequent expressed in the\nconclusion follows from the ground of knowledge given in the premises,\ndoes the ground of being in space determine its consequent in space: if I\nknow through perception the relation of these two, this certainty is just\nas great as any logical certainty. But every geometrical proposition is\njust as good an expression of such a relation as one of the twelve axioms;\nit is a metaphysical truth, and as such, just as certain as the principle\nof contradiction itself, which is a metalogical truth, and the common\nfoundation of all logical demonstration. Whoever denies the necessity,\nexhibited for intuition or perception, of the space-relations expressed in\nany proposition, may just as well deny the axioms, or that the conclusion\nfollows from the premises, or, indeed, he may as well deny the principle\nof contradiction itself, for all these relations are equally\nundemonstrable, immediately evident and known _a priori_. For any one to\nwish to derive the necessity of space-relations, known in intuition or\nperception, from the principle of contradiction by means of a logical\ndemonstration is just the same as for the feudal superior of an estate to\nwish to hold it as the vassal of another. Yet this is what Euclid has\ndone. His axioms only, he is compelled to leave resting upon immediate\nevidence; all the geometrical truths which follow are demonstrated\nlogically, that is to say, from the agreement of the assumptions made in\nthe proposition with the axioms which are presupposed, or with some\nearlier proposition; or from the contradiction between the opposite of the\nproposition and the assumptions made in it, or the axioms, or earlier\npropositions, or even itself. But the axioms themselves have no more\nimmediate evidence than any other geometrical problem, but only more\nsimplicity on account of their smaller content.\n\nWhen a criminal is examined, a _procès-verbal_ is made of his statement in\norder that we may judge of its truth from its consistency. But this is\nonly a makeshift, and we are not satisfied with it if it is possible to\ninvestigate the truth of each of his answers for itself; especially as he\nmight lie consistently from the beginning. But Euclid investigated space\naccording to this first method. He set about it, indeed, under the correct\nassumption that nature must everywhere be consistent, and that therefore\nit must also be so in space, its fundamental form. Since then the parts of\nspace stand to each other in a relation of reason and consequent, no\nsingle property of space can be different from what it is without being in\ncontradiction with all the others. But this is a very troublesome,\nunsatisfactory, and roundabout way to follow. It prefers indirect\nknowledge to direct, which is just as certain, and it separates the\nknowledge that a thing is from the knowledge why it is, to the great\ndisadvantage of the science; and lastly, it entirely withholds from the\nbeginner insight into the laws of space, and indeed renders him\nunaccustomed to the special investigation of the ground and inner\nconnection of things, inclining him to be satisfied with a mere historical\nknowledge that a thing is as it is. The exercise of acuteness which this\nmethod is unceasingly extolled as affording consists merely in this, that\nthe pupil practises drawing conclusions, _i.e._, he practises applying the\nprinciple of contradiction, but specially he exerts his memory to retain\nall those data whose agreement is to be tested. Moreover, it is worth\nnoticing that this method of proof was applied only to geometry and not to\narithmetic. In arithmetic the truth is really allowed to come home to us\nthrough perception alone, which in it consists simply in counting. As the\nperception of numbers is in _time alone_, and therefore cannot be\nrepresented by a sensuous schema like the geometrical figure, the\nsuspicion that perception is merely empirical, and possibly illusive,\ndisappeared in arithmetic, and the introduction of the logical method of\nproof into geometry was entirely due to this suspicion. As time has only\none dimension, counting is the only arithmetical operation, to which all\nothers may be reduced; and yet counting is just intuition or perception _a\npriori_, to which there is no hesitation in appealing here, and through\nwhich alone everything else, every sum and every equation, is ultimately\nproved. We prove, for example, not that (7 + 9 × 8 - 2)/3 = 42; but we\nrefer to the pure perception in time, counting thus makes each individual\nproblem an axiom. Instead of the demonstrations that fill geometry, the\nwhole content of arithmetic and algebra is thus simply a method of\nabbreviating counting. We mentioned above that our immediate perception of\nnumbers in time extends only to about ten. Beyond this an abstract concept\nof the numbers, fixed by a word, must take the place of the perception;\nwhich does not therefore actually occur any longer, but is only indicated\nin a thoroughly definite manner. Yet even so, by the important assistance\nof the system of figures which enables us to represent all larger numbers\nby the same small ones, intuitive or perceptive evidence of every sum is\nmade possible, even where we make such use of abstraction that not only\nthe numbers, but indefinite quantities and whole operations are thought\nonly in the abstract and indicated as so thought, as [sqrt](r^b) so that\nwe do not perform them, but merely symbolise them.\n\nWe might establish truth in geometry also, through pure _a priori_\nperception, with the same right and certainty as in arithmetic. It is in\nfact always this necessity, known through perception in accordance with\nthe principle of sufficient reason of being, which gives to geometry its\nprincipal evidence, and upon which in the consciousness of every one, the\ncertainty of its propositions rests. The stilted logical demonstration is\nalways foreign to the matter, and is generally soon forgotten, without\nweakening our conviction. It might indeed be dispensed with altogether\nwithout diminishing the evidence of geometry, for this is always quite\nindependent of such demonstration, which never proves anything we are not\nconvinced of already, through another kind of knowledge. So far then it is\nlike a cowardly soldier, who adds a wound to an enemy slain by another,\nand then boasts that he slew him himself.(22)\n\nAfter all this we hope there will be no doubt that the evidence of\nmathematics, which has become the pattern and symbol of all evidence,\nrests essentially not upon demonstration, but upon immediate perception,\nwhich is thus here, as everywhere else, the ultimate ground and source of\ntruth. Yet the perception which lies at the basis of mathematics has a\ngreat advantage over all other perception, and therefore over empirical\nperception. It is _a priori_, and therefore independent of experience,\nwhich is always given only in successive parts; therefore everything is\nequally near to it, and we can start either from the reason or from the\nconsequent, as we please. Now this makes it absolutely reliable, for in it\nthe consequent is known from the reason, and this is the only kind of\nknowledge that has necessity; for example, the equality of the sides is\nknown as established by the equality of the angles. All empirical\nperception, on the other hand, and the greater part of experience,\nproceeds conversely from the consequent to the reason, and this kind of\nknowledge is not infallible, for necessity only attaches to the consequent\non account of the reason being given, and no necessity attaches to the\nknowledge of the reason from the consequent, for the same consequent may\nfollow from different reasons. The latter kind of knowledge is simply\ninduction, _i.e._, from many consequents which point to one reason, the\nreason is accepted as certain; but as the cases can never be all before\nus, the truth here is not unconditionally certain. But all knowledge\nthrough sense-perception, and the great bulk of experience, has only this\nkind of truth. The affection of one of the senses induces the\nunderstanding to infer a cause of the effect, but, as a conclusion from\nthe consequent to the reason is never certain, illusion, which is\ndeception of the senses, is possible, and indeed often occurs, as was\npointed out above. Only when several of the senses, or it may be all the\nfive, receive impressions which point to the same cause, the possibility\nof illusion is reduced to a minimum; but yet it still exists, for there\nare cases, for example, the case of counterfeit money, in which all the\nsenses are deceived. All empirical knowledge, and consequently the whole\nof natural science, is in the same position, except only the pure, or as\nKant calls it, metaphysical part of it. Here also the causes are known\nfrom the effects, consequently all natural philosophy rests upon\nhypotheses, which are often false, and must then gradually give place to\nmore correct ones. Only in the case of purposely arranged experiments,\nknowledge proceeds from the cause to the effect, that is, it follows the\nmethod that affords certainty; but these experiments themselves are\nundertaken in consequence of hypotheses. Therefore, no branch of natural\nscience, such as physics, or astronomy, or physiology could be discovered\nall at once, as was the case with mathematics and logic, but required and\nrequires the collected and compared experiences of many centuries. In the\nfirst place, repeated confirmation in experience brings the induction,\nupon which the hypothesis rests, so near completeness that in practice it\ntakes the place of certainty, and is regarded as diminishing the value of\nthe hypothesis, its source, just as little as the incommensurability of\nstraight and curved lines diminishes the value of the application of\ngeometry, or that perfect exactness of the logarithm, which is not\nattainable, diminishes the value of arithmetic. For as the logarithm, or\nthe squaring of the circle, approaches infinitely near to correctness\nthrough infinite fractions, so, through manifold experience, the\ninduction, _i.e._, the knowledge of the cause from the effects,\napproaches, not infinitely indeed, but yet so near mathematical evidence,\n_i.e._, knowledge of the effects from the cause, that the possibility of\nmistake is small enough to be neglected, but yet the possibility exists;\nfor example, a conclusion from an indefinite number of cases to all cases,\n_i.e._, to the unknown ground on which all depend, is an induction. What\nconclusion of this kind seems more certain than that all men have the\nheart on the left side? Yet there are extremely rare and quite isolated\nexceptions of men who have the heart upon the right side. Sense-perception\nand empirical science have, therefore, the same kind of evidence. The\nadvantage which mathematics, pure natural science, and logic have over\nthem, as _a priori_ knowledge, rests merely upon this, that the formal\nelement in knowledge upon which all that is _a priori_ is based, is given\nas a whole and at once, and therefore in it we can always proceed from the\ncause to the effect, while in the former kind of knowledge we are\ngenerally obliged to proceed from the effect to the cause. In other\nrespects, the law of causality, or the principle of sufficient reason of\nchange, which guides empirical knowledge, is in itself just as certain as\nthe other forms of the principle of sufficient reason which are followed\nby the _a priori_ sciences referred to above. Logical demonstrations from\nconcepts or syllogisms have the advantage of proceeding from the reason to\nthe consequent, just as much as knowledge through perception _a priori_,\nand therefore in themselves, _i.e._, according to their form, they are\ninfallible. This has greatly assisted to bring demonstration in general\ninto such esteem. But this infallibility is merely relative; the\ndemonstration merely subsumes under the first principles of the science,\nand it is these which contain the whole material truth of science, and\nthey must not themselves be demonstrated, but must be founded on\nperception. In the few _a priori_ sciences we have named above, this\nperception is pure, but everywhere else it is empirical, and is only\nraised to universality through induction. If, then, in the empirical\nsciences also, the particular is proved from the general, yet the general,\non the other hand, has received its truth from the particular; it is only\na store of collected material, not a self-constituted foundation.\n\nSo much for the foundation of truth. Of the source and possibility of\nerror many explanations have been tried since Plato’s metaphorical\nsolution of the dove-cot where the wrong pigeons are caught, &c.\n(Theætetus, p. 167, _et seq._) Kant’s vague, indefinite explanation of the\nsource of error by means of the diagram of diagonal motion, will be found\nin the “Critique of Pure Reason,” p. 294 of the first edition, and p. 350\nof the fifth. As truth is the relation of a judgment to its ground of\nknowledge, it is always a problem how the person judging can believe that\nhe has such a ground of knowledge and yet not have it; that is to say, how\nerror, the deception of reason, is possible. I find this possibility quite\nanalogous to that of illusion, or the deception of the understanding,\nwhich has been explained above. My opinion is (and this is what gives this\nexplanation its proper place here) that _every error is an inference from\nthe consequent to the reason_, which indeed is valid when we know that the\nconsequent has that reason and can have no other; but otherwise is not\nvalid. The person who falls into error, either attributes to a consequent\na reason which it cannot have, in which case he shows actual deficiency of\nunderstanding, _i.e._, deficiency in the capacity for immediate knowledge\nof the connection between the cause and the effect, or, as more frequently\nhappens, he attributes to the effect a cause which is possible, but he\nadds to the major proposition of the syllogism, in which he infers the\ncause from the effect, that this effect _always_ results only from this\ncause. Now he could only be assured of this by a complete induction,\nwhich, however, he assumes without having made it. This “always” is\ntherefore too wide a concept, and instead of it he ought to have used\n“sometimes” or “generally.” The conclusion would then be problematical,\nand therefore not erroneous. That the man who errs should proceed in this\nway is due either to haste, or to insufficient knowledge of what is\npossible, on account of which he does not know the necessity of the\ninduction that ought to be made. Error then is quite analogous to\nillusion. Both are inferences from the effect to the cause; the illusion\nbrought about always in accordance with the law of causality, and by the\nunderstanding alone, thus directly, in perception itself; the error in\naccordance with all the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, and\nby the reason, thus in thought itself; yet most commonly in accordance\nwith the law of causality, as will appear from the three following\nexamples, which may be taken as types or representatives of the three\nkinds of error. (1.) The illusion of the senses (deception of the\nunderstanding) induces error (deception of the reason); for example, if\none mistakes a painting for an alto-relief, and actually takes it for\nsuch; the error results from a conclusion from the following major\npremise: “If dark grey passes regularly through all shades to white; the\ncause is _always_ the light, which strikes differently upon projections\nand depressions, _ergo_—.” (2.) “If there is no money in my safe, the\ncause is _always_ that my servant has got a key for it: _ergo_—.” (3.) “If\na ray of sunlight, broken through a prism, _i.e._, bent up or down,\nappears as a coloured band instead of round and white as before, the cause\nmust always be that light consists of homogeneous rays, differently\ncoloured and refrangible to different degrees, which, when forced asunder\non account of the difference of their refrangibility, give an elongated\nand variously-coloured spectrum: _ergo—bibamus!_”—It must be possible to\ntrace every error to such a conclusion, drawn from a major premise which\nis often only falsely generalised, hypothetical, and founded on the\nassumption that some particular cause is that of a certain effect. Only\ncertain mistakes in counting are to be excepted, and they are not really\nerrors, but merely mistakes. The operation prescribed by the concepts of\nthe numbers has not been carried out in pure intuition or perception, in\ncounting, but some other operation instead of it.\n\nAs regards the _content_ of the sciences generally, it is, in fact, always\nthe relation of the phenomena of the world to each other, according to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, under the guidance of the _why_, which has\nvalidity and meaning only through this principle. _Explanation_ is the\nestablishment of this relation. Therefore explanation can never go further\nthan to show two ideas standing to each other in the relation peculiar to\nthat form of the principle of sufficient reason which reigns in the class\nto which they belong. If this is done we cannot further be asked the\nquestion, _why_: for the relation proved is that one which absolutely\ncannot be imagined as other than it is, _i.e._, it is the form of all\nknowledge. Therefore we do not ask why 2 + 2 = 4; or why the equality of\nthe angles of a triangle determines the equality of the sides; or why its\neffect follows any given cause; or why the truth of the conclusion is\nevident from the truth of the premises. Every explanation which does not\nultimately lead to a relation of which no “why” can further be demanded,\nstops at an accepted _qualitas occulta_; but this is the character of\nevery original force of nature. Every explanation in natural science must\nultimately end with such a _qualitas occulta_, and thus with complete\nobscurity. It must leave the inner nature of a stone just as much\nunexplained as that of a human being; it can give as little account of the\nweight, the cohesion, the chemical qualities, &c., of the former, as of\nthe knowing and acting of the latter. Thus, for example, weight is a\n_qualitas occulta_, for it can be thought away, and does not proceed as a\nnecessity from the form of knowledge; which, on the contrary, is not the\ncase with the law of inertia, for it follows from the law of causality,\nand is therefore sufficiently explained if it is referred to that law.\nThere are two things which are altogether inexplicable,—that is to say, do\nnot ultimately lead to the relation which the principle of sufficient\nreason expresses. These are, first, the principle of sufficient reason\nitself in all its four forms, because it is the principle of all\nexplanation, which has meaning only in relation to it; secondly, that to\nwhich this principle does not extend, but which is the original source of\nall phenomena; the thing-in-itself, the knowledge of which is not subject\nto the principle of sufficient reason. We must be content for the present\nnot to understand this thing-in-itself, for it can only be made\nintelligible by means of the following book, in which we shall resume this\nconsideration of the possible achievements of the sciences. But at the\npoint at which natural science, and indeed every science, leaves things,\nbecause not only its explanation of them, but even the principle of this\nexplanation, the principle of sufficient reason, does not extend beyond\nthis point; there philosophy takes them up and treats them after its own\nmethod, which is quite distinct from the method of science. In my essay on\nthe principle of sufficient reason, § 51, I have shown how in the\ndifferent sciences the chief guiding clue is one or other form of that\nprinciple; and, in fact, perhaps the most appropriate classification of\nthe sciences might be based upon this circumstance. Every explanation\narrived at by the help of this clue is, as we have said, merely relative;\nit explains things in relation to each other, but something which indeed\nis presupposed is always left unexplained. In mathematics, for example,\nthis is space and time; in mechanics, physics, and chemistry it is matter,\nqualities, original forces and laws of nature; in botany and zoology it is\nthe difference of species, and life itself; in history it is the human\nrace with all its properties of thought and will: in all it is that form\nof the principle of sufficient reason which is respectively applicable. It\nis peculiar to _philosophy_ that it presupposes nothing as known, but\ntreats everything as equally external and a problem; not merely the\nrelations of phenomena, but also the phenomena themselves, and even the\nprinciple of sufficient reason to which the other sciences are content to\nrefer everything. In philosophy nothing would be gained by such a\nreference, as one member of the series is just as external to it as\nanother; and, moreover, that kind of connection is just as much a problem\nfor philosophy as what is joined together by it, and the latter again is\njust as much a problem after its combination has been explained as before\nit. For, as we have said, just what the sciences presuppose and lay down\nas the basis and the limits of their explanation, is precisely and\npeculiarly the problem of philosophy, which may therefore be said to begin\nwhere science ends. It cannot be founded upon demonstrations, for they\nlead from known principles to unknown, but everything is equally unknown\nand external to philosophy. There can be no principle in consequence of\nwhich the world with all its phenomena first came into existence, and\ntherefore it is not possible to construct, as Spinoza wished, a philosophy\nwhich demonstrates _ex firmis principiis_. Philosophy is the most general\nrational knowledge, the first principles of which cannot therefore be\nderived from another principle still more general. The principle of\ncontradiction establishes merely the agreement of concepts, but does not\nitself produce concepts. The principle of sufficient reason explains the\nconnections of phenomena, but not the phenomena themselves; therefore\nphilosophy cannot proceed upon these principles to seek a _causa\nefficiens_ or a _causa finalis_ of the whole world. My philosophy, at\nleast, does not by any means seek to know _whence_ or _wherefore_ the\nworld exists, but merely _what_ the world is. But the _why_ is here\nsubordinated to the _what_, for it already belongs to the world, as it\narises and has meaning and validity only through the form of its\nphenomena, the principle of sufficient reason. We might indeed say that\nevery one knows what the world is without help, for he is himself that\nsubject of knowledge of which the world is the idea; and so far this would\nbe true. But that knowledge is empirical, is in the concrete; the task of\nphilosophy is to reproduce this in the abstract to raise to permanent\nrational knowledge the successive changing perceptions, and in general,\nall that is contained under the wide concept of feeling and merely\nnegatively defined as not abstract, distinct, rational knowledge. It must\ntherefore consist of a statement in the abstract, of the nature of the\nwhole world, of the whole, and of all the parts. In order then that it may\nnot lose itself in the endless multitude of particular judgments, it must\nmake use of abstraction and think everything individual in the universal,\nand its differences also in the universal. It must therefore partly\nseparate and partly unite, in order to present to rational knowledge the\nwhole manifold of the world generally, according to its nature,\ncomprehended in a few abstract concepts. Through these concepts, in which\nit fixes the nature of the world, the whole individual must be known as\nwell as the universal, the knowledge of both therefore must be bound\ntogether to the minutest point. Therefore the capacity for philosophy\nconsists just in that in which Plato placed it, the knowledge of the one\nin the many, and the many in the one. Philosophy will therefore be a\nsum-total of general judgments, whose ground of knowledge is immediately\nthe world itself in its entirety, without excepting anything; thus all\nthat is to be found in human consciousness; it will be _a complete\nrecapitulation, as it were, a reflection, of the world in abstract\nconcepts_, which is only possible by the union of the essentially\nidentical in _one_ concept and the relegation of the different to another.\nThis task was already prescribed to philosophy by Bacon of Verulam when he\nsaid: _ea demum vera est philosophia, quae mundi ipsius voces fidelissime\nreddit, et veluti dictante mundo conscripta est, et nihil aliud est, quam\nejusdem_ SIMULACRUM ET REFLECTIO, _neque addit quidquam de proprio, sed\ntantum iterat et resonat_ (De Augm. Scient., L. 2, c. 13). But we take\nthis in a wider sense than Bacon could then conceive.\n\nThe agreement which all the sides and parts of the world have with each\nother, just because they belong to a whole, must also be found in this\nabstract copy of it. Therefore the judgments in this sum-total could to a\ncertain extent be deduced from each other, and indeed always reciprocally\nso deduced. Yet to make the first judgment possible, they must all be\npresent, and thus implied as prior to it in the knowledge of the world in\nthe concrete, especially as all direct proof is more certain than indirect\nproof; their harmony with each other by virtue of which they come together\ninto the unity of _one_ thought, and which arises from the harmony and\nunity of the world of perception itself, which is their common ground of\nknowledge, is not therefore to be made use of to establish them, as that\nwhich is prior to them, but is only added as a confirmation of their\ntruth. This problem itself can only become quite clear in being\nsolved.(23)",

    "page_content": "knowledge belonging to man alone, and the results and phenomena peculiar\nto human nature brought about by it, it still remains for me to speak of\nreason, so far as it is the guide of human action, and in this respect may\nbe called _practical_. But what there is to say upon this point has found\nits place elsewhere in the appendix to this work, where I controvert the\nexistence of the so-called practical reason of Kant, which he (certainly\nvery conveniently) explained as the immediate source of virtue, and as the\nseat of an absolute (_i.e._, fallen from heaven) imperative. The detailed\nand thorough refutation of this Kantian principle of morality I have given\nlater in the “Fundamental Problems of Ethics.” There remains, therefore,\nbut little for me to say here about the actual influence of reason, in the\ntrue sense of the word, upon action. At the commencement of our treatment\nof reason we remarked, in general terms, how much the action and behaviour\nof men differs from that of brutes, and that this difference is to be\nregarded as entirely due to the presence of abstract concepts in\nconsciousness. The influence of these upon our whole existence is so\npenetrating and significant that, on account of them, we are related to\nthe lower animals very much as those animals that see are related to those\nthat have no eyes (certain larvae, worms, and zoophytes). Animals without\neyes know only by touch what is immediately present to them in space, what\ncomes into contact with them; those which see, on the contrary, know a\nwide circle of near and distant objects. In the same way the absence of\nreason confines the lower animals to the ideas of perception, _i.e._, the\nreal objects which are immediately present to them in time; we, on the\ncontrary, on account of knowledge in the abstract, comprehend not only the\nnarrow actual present, but also the whole past and future, and the wide\nsphere of the possible; we view life freely on all its sides, and go far\nbeyond the present and the actual. Thus what the eye is in space and for\nsensuous knowledge, reason is, to a certain extent, in time and for inner\nknowledge. But as the visibility of objects has its worth and meaning only\nin the fact that it informs us of their tangibility, so the whole worth of\nabstract knowledge always consists in its relation to what is perceived.\nTherefore men naturally attach far more worth to immediate and perceived\nknowledge than to abstract concepts, to that which is merely thought; they\nplace empirical knowledge before logical. But this is not the opinion of\nmen who live more in words than in deeds, who have seen more on paper and\nin books than in actual life, and who in their greatest degeneracy become\npedants and lovers of the mere letter. Thus only is it conceivable that\nLeibnitz and Wolf and all their successors could go so far astray as to\nexplain knowledge of perception, after the example of Duns Scotus, as\nmerely confused abstract knowledge! To the honour of Spinoza, I must\nmention that his truer sense led him, on the contrary, to explain all\ngeneral concepts as having arisen from the confusion of that which was\nknown in perception (Eth. II., prop. 40, Schol. 1). It is also a result of\nperverted opinion that in mathematics the evidence proper to it was\nrejected, and logical evidence alone accepted; that everything in general\nwhich was not abstract knowledge was comprehended under the wide name of\nfeeling, and consequently was little valued; and lastly that the Kantian\nethics regarded the good will which immediately asserts itself upon\nknowledge of the circumstances, and guides to right and good action as\nmere feeling and emotion, and consequently as worthless and without merit,\nand would only recognise actions which proceed from abstract maxims as\nhaving moral worth.\n\nThe many-sided view of life as a whole which man, as distinguished from\nthe lower animals, possesses through reason, may be compared to a\ngeometrical, colourless, abstract, reduced plan of his actual life. He,\ntherefore, stands to the lower animals as the navigator who, by means of\nchart, compass, and quadrant, knows accurately his course and his position\nat any time upon the sea, stands to the uneducated sailors who see only\nthe waves and the heavens. Thus it is worth noticing, and indeed\nwonderful, how, besides his life in the concrete, man always lives another\nlife in the abstract. In the former he is given as a prey to all the\nstorms of actual life, and to the influence of the present; he must\nstruggle, suffer, and die like the brute. But his life in the abstract, as\nit lies before his rational consciousness, is the still reflection of the\nformer, and of the world in which he lives; it is just that reduced chart\nor plan to which we have referred. Here in the sphere of quiet\ndeliberation, what completely possessed him and moved him intensely\nbefore, appears to him cold, colourless, and for the moment external to\nhim; he is merely the spectator, the observer. In respect of this\nwithdrawal into reflection he may be compared to an actor who has played\nhis part in one scene, and who takes his place among the audience till it\nis time for him to go upon the stage again, and quietly looks on at\nwhatever may happen, even though it be the preparation for his own death\n(in the piece), but afterwards he again goes on the stage and acts and\nsuffers as he must. From this double life proceeds that quietness peculiar\nto human beings, so very different from the thoughtlessness of the brutes,\nand with which, in accordance with previous reflection, or a formed\ndetermination, or a recognised necessity, a man suffers or accomplishes in\ncold blood, what is of the utmost and often terrible importance to him;\nsuicide, execution, the duel, enterprises of every kind fraught with\ndanger to life, and, in general, things against which his whole animal\nnature rebels. Under such circumstances we see to what an extent reason\nhas mastered the animal nature, and we say to the strong: σιδηρειον νυ τοι\nἡτορ! (_ferreum certe tibi cor_), Il. 24, 521. Here we can say truly that\nreason manifests itself practically, and thus wherever action is guided by\nreason, where the motives are abstract concepts, wherever we are not\ndetermined by particular ideas of perception, nor by the impression of the\nmoment which guides the brutes, there _practical reason_ shows itself. But\nI have fully explained in the Appendix, and illustrated by examples, that\nthis is entirely different from and unrelated to the ethical worth of\nactions; that rational action and virtuous action are two entirely\ndifferent things; that reason may just as well find itself in connection\nwith great evil as with great good, and by its assistance may give great\npower to the one as well as to the other; that it is equally ready and\nvaluable for the methodical and consistent carrying out of the noble and\nof the bad intention, of the wise as of the foolish maxim; which all\nresults from the constitution of its nature, which is feminine, receptive,\nretentive, and not spontaneous; all this I have shown in detail in the\nAppendix, and illustrated by examples. What is said there would have been\nplaced here, but on account of my polemic against Kant’s pretended\npractical reason I have been obliged to relegate it to the Appendix, to\nwhich I therefore refer.\n\nThe ideal explained in the _Stoical philosophy_ is the most complete\ndevelopment of _practical reason_ in the true and genuine sense of the\nword; it is the highest summit to which man can attain by the mere use of\nhis reason, and in it his difference from the brutes shows itself most\ndistinctly. For the ethics of Stoicism are originally and essentially, not\na doctrine of virtue, but merely a guide to a rational life, the end and\naim of which is happiness through peace of mind. Virtuous conduct appears\nin it as it were merely by accident, as the means, not as the end.\nTherefore the ethical theory of Stoicism is in its whole nature and point\nof view fundamentally different from the ethical systems which lay stress\ndirectly upon virtue, such as the doctrines of the Vedas, of Plato, of\nChristianity, and of Kant. The aim of Stoical ethics is happiness: τελος\nτο ευδαι μονειν (_virtutes omnes finem habere beatitudinem_) it is called\nin the account of the Stoa by Stobæus (Ecl., L. ii. c. 7, p. 114, and also\np. 138). Yet the ethics of Stoicism teach that happiness can only be\nattained with certainty through inward peace and quietness of spirit\n(αταραξια), and that this again can only be reached through virtue; this\nis the whole meaning of the saying that virtue is the highest good. But if\nindeed by degrees the end is lost sight of in the means, and virtue is\ninculcated in a way which discloses an interest entirely different from\nthat of one’s own happiness, for it contradicts this too distinctly; this\nis just one of those inconsistencies by means of which, in every system,\nthe immediately known, or, as it is called, felt truth leads us back to\nthe right way in defiance of syllogistic reasoning; as, for example, we\nsee clearly in the ethical teaching of Spinoza, which deduces a pure\ndoctrine of virtue from the egoistical _suum utile quærere_ by means of\npalpable sophisms. According to this, as I conceive the spirit of the\nStoical ethics, their source lies in the question whether the great\nprerogative of man, reason, which, by means of planned action and its\nresults, relieves life and its burdens so much, might not also be capable\nof freeing him at once, directly, _i.e._, through mere knowledge,\ncompletely, or nearly so, of the sorrows and miseries of every kind of\nwhich his life is full. They held that it was not in keeping with the\nprerogative of reason that the nature given with it, which by means of it\ncomprehends and contemplates an infinity of things and circumstances,\nshould yet, through the present, and the accidents that can be contained\nin the few years of a life that is short, fleeting, and uncertain, be\nexposed to such intense pain, to such great anxiety and suffering, as\narise from the tempestuous strain of the desires and the antipathies; and\nthey believed that the due application of reason must raise men above\nthem, and can make them invulnerable. Therefore Antisthenes says: Δει\nκτασθαι νουν, η βροχον (_aut mentem parandam, aut laqueum._ Plut. de\nstoic. repugn., c. 14), _i.e._, life is so full of troubles and vexations,\nthat one must either rise above it by means of corrected thoughts, or\nleave it. It was seen that want and suffering did not directly and of\nnecessity spring from not having, but from desiring to have and not\nhaving; that therefore this desire to have is the necessary condition\nunder which alone it becomes a privation not to have and begets pain. Ου\nπενια λυπην εργαζεται, αλλα επιθυμια (_non paupertas dolorem efficit, sed\ncupiditas_), Epict., fragm. 25. Men learned also from experience that it\nis only the hope of what is claimed that begets and nourishes the wish;\ntherefore neither the many unavoidable evils which are common to all, nor\nunattainable blessings, disquiet or trouble us, but only the trifling more\nor less of those things which we can avoid or attain; indeed, not only\nwhat is absolutely unavoidable or unattainable, but also what is merely\nrelatively so, leaves us quite undisturbed; therefore the ills that have\nonce become joined to our individuality, or the good things that must of\nnecessity always be denied us, are treated with indifference, in\naccordance with the peculiarity of human nature that every wish soon dies\nand can no more beget pain if it is not nourished by hope. It followed\nfrom all this that happiness always depends upon the proportion between\nour claims and what we receive. It is all one whether the quantities thus\nrelated be great or small, and the proportion can be established just as\nwell by diminishing the amount of the first as by increasing the amount of\nthe second; and in the same way it also follows that all suffering\nproceeds from the want of proportion between what we demand and expect and\nwhat we get. Now this want of proportion obviously lies only in knowledge,\nand it could be entirely abolished through fuller insight.(24) Therefore\nChrysippus says: δει ζῃν κατ᾽ εμπειριαν των φυσει συμβαινοντων (Stob.\nEcl., L. ii. c. 7, p. 134), that is, one ought to live with a due\nknowledge of the transitory nature of the things of the world. For as\noften as a man loses self-command, or is struck down by a misfortune, or\ngrows angry, or becomes faint-hearted, he shows that he finds things\ndifferent from what he expected, consequently that he was caught in error,\nand did not know the world and life, did not know that the will of the\nindividual is crossed at every step by the chance of inanimate nature and\nthe antagonism of aims and the wickedness of other individuals: he has\ntherefore either not made use of his reason in order to arrive at a\ngeneral knowledge of this characteristic of life, or he lacks judgment, in\nthat he does not recognise in the particular what he knows in general, and\nis therefore surprised by it and loses his self-command.(25) Thus also\nevery keen pleasure is an error and an illusion, for no attained wish can\ngive lasting satisfaction; and, moreover, every possession and every\nhappiness is but lent by chance for an uncertain time, and may therefore\nbe demanded back the next hour. All pain rests on the passing away of such\nan illusion; thus both arise from defective knowledge; the wise man\ntherefore holds himself equally aloof from joy and sorrow, and no event\ndisturbs his αταραξια.\n\nIn accordance with this spirit and aim of the Stoa, Epictetus began and\nended with the doctrine as the kernel of his philosophy, that we should\nconsider well and distinguish what depends upon us and what does not, and\ntherefore entirely avoid counting upon the latter, whereby we shall\ncertainly remain free from all pain, sorrow, and anxiety. But that which\nalone is dependent upon us is the will; and here a transition gradually\ntakes place to a doctrine of virtue, for it is observed that as the outer\nworld, which is independent of us, determines good and bad fortune, so\ninner contentment with ourselves, or the absence of it, proceeds from the\nwill. But it was then asked whether we ought to apply the words _bonum_\nand _malum_ to the two former or to the two latter? This was indeed\narbitrary and a matter of choice, and did not make any real difference,\nbut yet the Stoics disputed everlastingly with the Peripatetics and\nEpicureans about it, and amused themselves with the inadmissible\ncomparison of two entirely incommensurable quantities, and the\nantithetical, paradoxical judgments which proceeded from them, and which\nthey flung at each other. The _Paradoxa_ of Cicero afford us an\ninteresting collection of these from the Stoical side.\n\nZeno, the founder, seems originally to have followed a somewhat different\npath. The starting-point with him was that for the attainment of the\nhighest good, _i.e._, blessedness and spiritual peace, one must live in\nharmony with oneself (ὁμολογουμενους ξῃν; δ᾽ εστι καθ᾽ ἑνα λογον και\nσυμφωνον ξῃν.—_Consonanter vivere: hoc est secundum unam rationem et\nconcordem sibi vivere._ Stob. Ecl. eth. L. ii., c. 7, p. 132. Also: Αρετην\nδιαθεσιν ειναι ψυχης συμφωνον ἑαυτῃ περι ὁλον τον βιον. _Virtutem esse\nanimi affectiomem secum per totam vitam consentientem_, _ibid._, p. 104.)\nNow this was only possible for a man if he determined himself entirely\nrationally, according to concepts, not according to changing impressions\nand moods; since, however, only the maxims of our conduct, not the\nconsequences nor the outward circumstances, are in our power, in order to\nbe always consistent we must set before us as our aim only the maxims and\nnot the consequences and circumstances, and thus again a doctrine of\nvirtue is introduced.\n\nBut the ethical principle of Zeno—to live in harmony with oneself—appeared\neven to his immediate successors to be too formal and empty. They\ntherefore gave it material content by the addition—“to live in harmony\nwith nature” (ὁμολογουμενως τῃ φυσει ζῃν), which, as Stobæus mentions in\nanother place, was first added by Kleanthes, and extended the matter very\nmuch on account of the wide sphere of the concept and the vagueness of the\nexpression. For Kleanthes meant the whole of nature in general, while\nChrysippus meant human nature in particular (Diog. Laert., 7, 89). It\nfollowed that what alone was adapted to the latter was virtue, just as the\nsatisfaction of animal desires was adapted to animal natures; and thus\nethics had again to be forcibly united to a doctrine of virtue, and in\nsome way or other established through physics. For the Stoics always aimed\nat unity of principle, as for them God and the world were not dissevered.\n\nThe ethical system of Stoicism, regarded as a whole, is in fact a very\nvaluable and estimable attempt to use the great prerogative of man,\nreason, for an important and salutary end; to raise him above the\nsuffering and pain to which all life is exposed, by means of a maxim—\n\n    “_Qua ratione queas traducere leniter œvum:_\n    _Ne te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido,_\n    _Ne pavor et rerum mediocriter utilium spes,_”\n\nand thus to make him partake, in the highest degree, of the dignity which\nbelongs to him as a rational being, as distinguished from the brutes; a\ndignity of which, in this sense at any rate, we can speak, though not in\nany other. It is a consequence of my view of the ethical system of\nStoicism that it must be explained at the part of my work at which I\nconsider what reason is and what it can do. But although it may to a\ncertain extent be possible to attain that end through the application of\nreason, and through a purely rational system of ethics, and although\nexperience shows that the happiest men are those purely rational\ncharacters commonly called practical philosophers,—and rightly so, because\njust as the true, that is, the theoretical philosopher carries life into\nthe concept, they carry the concept into life,—yet it is far from the case\nthat perfection can be attained in this way, and that the reason, rightly\nused, can really free us from the burden and sorrow of life, and lead us\nto happiness. Rather, there lies an absolute contradiction in wishing to\nlive without suffering, and this contradiction is also implied in the\ncommonly used expression, “blessed life.” This will become perfectly clear\nto whoever comprehends the whole of the following exposition. In this\npurely rational system of ethics the contradiction reveals itself thus,\nthe Stoic is obliged in his doctrine of the way to the blessed life (for\nthat is what his ethical system always remains) to insert a recommendation\nof suicide (as among the magnificent ornaments and apparel of Eastern\ndespots there is always a costly vial of poison) for the case in which the\nsufferings of the body, which cannot be philosophised away by any\nprinciples or syllogistic reasonings, are paramount and incurable; thus\nits one aim, blessedness, is rendered vain, and nothing remains as a mode\nof escape from suffering except death; in such a case then death must be\nvoluntarily accepted, just as we would take any other medicine. Here then\na marked antagonism is brought out between the ethical system of Stoicism\nand all those systems referred to above which make virtue in itself\ndirectly, and accompanied by the most grievous sorrows, their aim, and\nwill not allow a man to end his life in order to escape from suffering.\nNot one of them, however, was able to give the true reason for the\nrejection of suicide, but they laboriously collected illusory explanations\nfrom all sides: the true reason will appear in the Fourth Book in the\ncourse of the development of our system. But the antagonism referred to\nreveals and establishes the essential difference in fundamental principle\nbetween Stoicism, which is just a special form of endæmonism, and those\ndoctrines we have mentioned, although both are often at one in their\nresults, and are apparently related. And the inner contradiction referred\nto above, with which the ethical system of Stoicism is affected even in\nits fundamental thought, shows itself further in the circumstance that its\nideal, the Stoic philosopher, as the system itself represents him, could\nnever obtain life or inner poetic truth, but remains a wooden, stiff\nlay-figure of which nothing can be made. He cannot himself make use of his\nwisdom, and his perfect peace, contentment, and blessedness directly\ncontradict the nature of man, and preclude us from forming any concrete\nidea of him. When compared with him, how entirely different appear the\novercomers of the world, and voluntary hermits that Indian philosophy\npresents to us, and has actually produced; or indeed, the holy man of\nChristianity, that excellent form full of deep life, of the greatest\npoetic truth, and the highest significance, which stands before us in\nperfect virtue, holiness, and sublimity, yet in a state of supreme\nsuffering.(26)\n\nSECOND BOOK.

    "page_content": "only according to its general form. It is true that as far as the abstract\nidea, the concept, is concerned, we obtained a knowledge of it in respect\nof its content also, because it has content and meaning only in relation\nto the idea of perception, without which it would be worthless and empty.\nAccordingly, directing our attention exclusively to the idea of\nperception, we shall now endeavour to arrive at a knowledge of its\ncontent, its more exact definition, and the forms which it presents to us.\nAnd it will specially interest us to find an explanation of its peculiar\nsignificance, that significance which is otherwise merely felt, but on\naccount of which it is that these pictures do not pass by us entirely\nstrange and meaningless, as they must otherwise do, but speak to us\ndirectly, are understood, and obtain an interest which concerns our whole\nnature.\n\nWe direct our attention to mathematics, natural science, and philosophy,\nfor each of these holds out the hope that it will afford us a part of the\nexplanation we desire. Now, taking philosophy first, we find that it is\nlike a monster with many heads, each of which speaks a different language.\nThey are not, indeed, all at variance on the point we are here\nconsidering, the significance of the idea of perception. For, with the\nexception of the Sceptics and the Idealists, the others, for the most\npart, speak very much in the same way of an _object_ which constitutes the\n_basis_ of the idea, and which is indeed different in its whole being and\nnature from the idea, but yet is in all points as like it as one egg is to\nanother. But this does not help us, for we are quite unable to distinguish\nsuch an object from the idea; we find that they are one and the same; for\nevery object always and for ever presupposes a subject, and therefore\nremains idea, so that we recognised objectivity as belonging to the most\nuniversal form of the idea, which is the division into subject and object.\nFurther, the principle of sufficient reason, which is referred to in\nsupport of this doctrine, is for us merely the form of the idea, the\norderly combination of one idea with another, but not the combination of\nthe whole finite or infinite series of ideas with something which is not\nidea at all, and which cannot therefore be presented in perception. Of the\nSceptics and Idealists we spoke above, in examining the controversy about\nthe reality of the outer world.\n\nIf we turn to mathematics to look for the fuller knowledge we desire of\nthe idea of perception, which we have, as yet, only understood generally,\nmerely in its form, we find that mathematics only treats of these ideas so\nfar as they fill time and space, that is, so far as they are quantities.\nIt will tell us with the greatest accuracy the how-many and the how-much;\nbut as this is always merely relative, that is to say, merely a comparison\nof one idea with others, and a comparison only in the one respect of\nquantity, this also is not the information we are principally in search\nof.\n\nLastly, if we turn to the wide province of natural science, which is\ndivided into many fields, we may, in the first place, make a general\ndivision of it into two parts. It is either the description of forms,\nwhich I call _Morphology_, or the explanation of changes, which I call\n_Etiology_. The first treats of the permanent forms, the second of the\nchanging matter, according to the laws of its transition from one form to\nanother. The first is the whole extent of what is generally called natural\nhistory. It teaches us, especially in the sciences of botany and zoology,\nthe various permanent, organised, and therefore definitely determined\nforms in the constant change of individuals; and these forms constitute a\ngreat part of the content of the idea of perception. In natural history\nthey are classified, separated, united, arranged according to natural and\nartificial systems, and brought under concepts which make a general view\nand knowledge of the whole of them possible. Further, an infinitely fine\nanalogy both in the whole and in the parts of these forms, and running\nthrough them all (_unité de plan_), is established, and thus they may be\ncompared to innumerable variations on a theme which is not given. The\npassage of matter into these forms, that is to say, the origin of\nindividuals, is not a special part of natural science, for every\nindividual springs from its like by generation, which is everywhere\nequally mysterious, and has as yet evaded definite knowledge. The little\nthat is known on the subject finds its place in physiology, which belongs\nto that part of natural science I have called etiology. Mineralogy also,\nespecially where it becomes geology, inclines towards etiology, though it\nprincipally belongs to morphology. Etiology proper comprehends all those\nbranches of natural science in which the chief concern is the knowledge of\ncause and effect. The sciences teach how, according to an invariable rule,\none condition of matter is necessarily followed by a certain other\ncondition; how one change necessarily conditions and brings about a\ncertain other change; this sort of teaching is called _explanation_. The\nprincipal sciences in this department are mechanics, physics, chemistry,\nand physiology.\n\nIf, however, we surrender ourselves to its teaching, we soon become\nconvinced that etiology cannot afford us the information we chiefly\ndesire, any more than morphology. The latter presents to us innumerable\nand infinitely varied forms, which are yet related by an unmistakable\nfamily likeness. These are for us ideas, and when only treated in this\nway, they remain always strange to us, and stand before us like\nhieroglyphics which we do not understand. Etiology, on the other hand,\nteaches us that, according to the law of cause and effect, this particular\ncondition of matter brings about that other particular condition, and thus\nit has explained it and performed its part. However, it really does\nnothing more than indicate the orderly arrangement according to which the\nstates of matter appear in space and time, and teach in all cases what\nphenomenon must necessarily appear at a particular time in a particular\nplace. It thus determines the position of phenomena in time and space,\naccording to a law whose special content is derived from experience, but\nwhose universal form and necessity is yet known to us independently of\nexperience. But it affords us absolutely no information about the inner\nnature of any one of these phenomena: this is called a _force of nature_,\nand it lies outside the province of causal explanation, which calls the\nconstant uniformity with which manifestations of such a force appear\nwhenever their known conditions are present, a _law of nature_. But this\nlaw of nature, these conditions, and this appearance in a particular place\nat a particular time, are all that it knows or ever can know. The force\nitself which manifests itself, the inner nature of the phenomena which\nappear in accordance with these laws, remains always a secret to it,\nsomething entirely strange and unknown in the case of the simplest as well\nas of the most complex phenomena. For although as yet etiology has most\ncompletely achieved its aim in mechanics, and least completely in\nphysiology, still the force on account of which a stone falls to the\nground or one body repels another is, in its inner nature, not less\nstrange and mysterious than that which produces the movements and the\ngrowth of an animal. The science of mechanics presupposes matter, weight,\nimpenetrability, the possibility of communicating motion by impact,\ninertia and so forth as ultimate facts, calls them forces of nature, and\ntheir necessary and orderly appearance under certain conditions a law of\nnature. Only after this does its explanation begin, and it consists in\nindicating truly and with mathematical exactness, how, where and when each\nforce manifests itself, and in referring every phenomenon which presents\nitself to the operation of one of these forces. Physics, chemistry, and\nphysiology proceed in the same way in their province, only they presuppose\nmore and accomplish less. Consequently the most complete etiological\nexplanation of the whole of nature can never be more than an enumeration\nof forces which cannot be explained, and a reliable statement of the rule\naccording to which phenomena appear in time and space, succeed, and make\nway for each other. But the inner nature of the forces which thus appear\nremains unexplained by such an explanation, which must confine itself to\nphenomena and their arrangement, because the law which it follows does not\nextend further. In this respect it may be compared to a section of a piece\nof marble which shows many veins beside each other, but does not allow us\nto trace the course of the veins from the interior of the marble to its\nsurface. Or, if I may use an absurd but more striking comparison, the\nphilosophical investigator must always have the same feeling towards the\ncomplete etiology of the whole of nature, as a man who, without knowing\nhow, has been brought into a company quite unknown to him, each member of\nwhich in turn presents another to him as his friend and cousin, and\ntherefore as quite well known, and yet the man himself, while at each\nintroduction he expresses himself gratified, has always the question on\nhis lips: “But how the deuce do I stand to the whole company?”\n\nThus we see that, with regard to those phenomena which we know only as our\nideas, etiology can never give us the desired information that shall carry\nus beyond this point. For, after all its explanations, they still remain\nquite strange to us, as mere ideas whose significance we do not\nunderstand. The causal connection merely gives us the rule and the\nrelative order of their appearance in space and time, but affords us no\nfurther knowledge of that which so appears. Moreover, the law of causality\nitself has only validity for ideas, for objects of a definite class, and\nit has meaning only in so far as it presupposes them. Thus, like these\nobjects themselves, it always exists only in relation to a subject, that\nis, conditionally; and so it is known just as well if we start from the\nsubject, _i.e._, _a priori_, as if we start from the object, _i.e._, _a\nposteriori_. Kant indeed has taught us this.\n\nBut what now impels us to inquiry is just that we are not satisfied with\nknowing that we have ideas, that they are such and such, and that they are\nconnected according to certain laws, the general expression of which is\nthe principle of sufficient reason. We wish to know the significance of\nthese ideas; we ask whether this world is merely idea; in which case it\nwould pass by us like an empty dream or a baseless vision, not worth our\nnotice; or whether it is also something else, something more than idea,\nand if so, what. Thus much is certain, that this something we seek for\nmust be completely and in its whole nature different from the idea; that\nthe forms and laws of the idea must therefore be completely foreign to it;\nfurther, that we cannot arrive at it from the idea under the guidance of\nthe laws which merely combine objects, ideas, among themselves, and which\nare the forms of the principle of sufficient reason.\n\nThus we see already that we can never arrive at the real nature of things\nfrom without. However much we investigate, we can never reach anything but\nimages and names. We are like a man who goes round a castle seeking in\nvain for an entrance, and sometimes sketching the façades. And yet this is\nthe method that has been followed by all philosophers before me.",

    "page_content": "present to us only as our idea, or the transition from the world as mere\nidea of the knowing subject to whatever it may be besides this, would\nnever be found if the investigator himself were nothing more than the pure\nknowing subject (a winged cherub without a body). But he is himself rooted\nin that world; he finds himself in it as an _individual_, that is to say,\nhis knowledge, which is the necessary supporter of the whole world as\nidea, is yet always given through the medium of a body, whose affections\nare, as we have shown, the starting-point for the understanding in the\nperception of that world. His body is, for the pure knowing subject, an\nidea like every other idea, an object among objects. Its movements and\nactions are so far known to him in precisely the same way as the changes\nof all other perceived objects, and would be just as strange and\nincomprehensible to him if their meaning were not explained for him in an\nentirely different way. Otherwise he would see his actions follow upon\ngiven motives with the constancy of a law of nature, just as the changes\nof other objects follow upon causes, stimuli, or motives. But he would not\nunderstand the influence of the motives any more than the connection\nbetween every other effect which he sees and its cause. He would then call\nthe inner nature of these manifestations and actions of his body which he\ndid not understand a force, a quality, or a character, as he pleased, but\nhe would have no further insight into it. But all this is not the case;\nindeed the answer to the riddle is given to the subject of knowledge who\nappears as an individual, and the answer is _will_. This and this alone\ngives him the key to his own existence, reveals to him the significance,\nshows him the inner mechanism of his being, of his action, of his\nmovements. The body is given in two entirely different ways to the subject\nof knowledge, who becomes an individual only through his identity with it.\nIt is given as an idea in intelligent perception, as an object among\nobjects and subject to the laws of objects. And it is also given in quite\na different way as that which is immediately known to every one, and is\nsignified by the word _will_. Every true act of his will is also at once\nand without exception a movement of his body. The act of will and the\nmovement of the body are not two different things objectively known, which\nthe bond of causality unites; they do not stand in the relation of cause\nand effect; they are one and the same, but they are given in entirely\ndifferent ways,—immediately, and again in perception for the\nunderstanding. The action of the body is nothing but the act of the will\nobjectified, _i.e._, passed into perception. It will appear later that\nthis is true of every movement of the body, not merely those which follow\nupon motives, but also involuntary movements which follow upon mere\nstimuli, and, indeed, that the whole body is nothing but objectified will,\n_i.e._, will become idea. All this will be proved and made quite clear in\nthe course of this work. In one respect, therefore, I shall call the body\nthe _objectivity of will_; as in the previous book, and in the essay on\nthe principle of sufficient reason, in accordance with the one-sided point\nof view intentionally adopted there (that of the idea), I called it _the\nimmediate object_. Thus in a certain sense we may also say that will is\nthe knowledge _a priori_ of the body, and the body is the knowledge _a\nposteriori_ of the will. Resolutions of the will which relate to the\nfuture are merely deliberations of the reason about what we shall will at\na particular time, not real acts of will. Only the carrying out of the\nresolve stamps it as will, for till then it is never more than an\nintention that may be changed, and that exists only in the reason _in\nabstracto_. It is only in reflection that to will and to act are\ndifferent; in reality they are one. Every true, genuine, immediate act of\nwill is also, at once and immediately, a visible act of the body. And,\ncorresponding to this, every impression upon the body is also, on the\nother hand, at once and immediately an impression upon the will. As such\nit is called pain when it is opposed to the will; gratification or\npleasure when it is in accordance with it. The degrees of both are widely\ndifferent. It is quite wrong, however, to call pain and pleasure ideas,\nfor they are by no means ideas, but immediate affections of the will in\nits manifestation, the body; compulsory, instantaneous willing or\nnot-willing of the impression which the body sustains. There are only a\nfew impressions of the body which do not touch the will, and it is through\nthese alone that the body is an immediate object of knowledge, for, as\nperceived by the understanding, it is already an indirect object like all\nothers. These impressions are, therefore, to be treated directly as mere\nideas, and excepted from what has been said. The impressions we refer to\nare the affections of the purely objective senses of sight, hearing, and\ntouch, though only so far as these organs are affected in the way which is\nspecially peculiar to their specific nature. This affection of them is so\nexcessively weak an excitement of the heightened and specifically modified\nsensibility of these parts that it does not affect the will, but only\nfurnishes the understanding with the data out of which the perception\narises, undisturbed by any excitement of the will. But every stronger or\ndifferent kind of affection of these organs of sense is painful, that is\nto say, against the will, and thus they also belong to its objectivity.\nWeakness of the nerves shows itself in this, that the impressions which\nhave only such a degree of strength as would usually be sufficient to make\nthem data for the understanding reach the higher degree at which they\ninfluence the will, that is to say, give pain or pleasure, though more\noften pain, which is, however, to some extent deadened and inarticulate,\nso that not only particular tones and strong light are painful to us, but\nthere ensues a generally unhealthy and hypochondriacal disposition which\nis not distinctly understood. The identity of the body and the will shows\nitself further, among other ways, in the circumstance that every vehement\nand excessive movement of the will, _i.e._, every emotion, agitates the\nbody and its inner constitution directly, and disturbs the course of its\nvital functions. This is shown in detail in “Will in Nature,” p. 27 of the\nsecond edition and p. 28 of the third.\n\nLastly, the knowledge which I have of my will, though it is immediate,\ncannot be separated from that which I have of my body. I know my will, not\nas a whole, not as a unity, not completely, according to its nature, but I\nknow it only in its particular acts, and therefore in time, which is the\nform of the phenomenal aspect of my body, as of every object. Therefore\nthe body is a condition of the knowledge of my will. Thus, I cannot really\nimagine this will apart from my body. In the essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason, the will, or rather the subject of willing, is treated\nas a special class of ideas or objects. But even there we saw this object\nbecome one with the subject; that is, we saw it cease to be an object. We\nthere called this union the miracle κατ᾽ εξοχην, and the whole of the\npresent work is to a certain extent an explanation of this. So far as I\nknow my will specially as object, I know it as body. But then I am again\nat the first class of ideas laid down in that essay, _i.e._, real objects.\nAs we proceed we shall see always more clearly that these ideas of the\nfirst class obtain their explanation and solution from those of the fourth\nclass given in the essay, which could no longer be properly opposed to the\nsubject as object, and that, therefore, we must learn to understand the\ninner nature of the law of causality which is valid in the first class,\nand of all that happens in accordance with it from the law of motivation\nwhich governs the fourth class.\n\nThe identity of the will and the body, of which we have now given a\ncursory explanation, can only be proved in the manner we have adopted\nhere. We have proved this identity for the first time, and shall do so\nmore and more fully in the course of this work. By “proved” we mean raised\nfrom the immediate consciousness, from knowledge in the concrete to\nabstract knowledge of the reason, or carried over into abstract knowledge.\nOn the other hand, from its very nature it can never be demonstrated, that\nis, deduced as indirect knowledge from some other more direct knowledge,\njust because it is itself the most direct knowledge; and if we do not\napprehend it and stick to it as such, we shall expect in vain to receive\nit again in some indirect way as derivative knowledge. It is knowledge of\nquite a special kind, whose truth cannot therefore properly be brought\nunder any of the four rubrics under which I have classified all truth in\nthe essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 29, the logical, the\nempirical, the metaphysical, and the metalogical, for it is not, like all\nthese, the relation of an abstract idea to another idea, or to the\nnecessary form of perceptive or of abstract ideation, but it is the\nrelation of a judgment to the connection which an idea of perception, the\nbody, has to that which is not an idea at all, but something _toto genere_\ndifferent, will. I should like therefore to distinguish this from all\nother truth, and call it κατ᾽ εξοχην _philosophical truth_. We can turn\nthe expression of this truth in different ways and say: My body and my\nwill are one;—or, What as an idea of perception I call my body, I call my\nwill, so far as I am conscious of it in an entirely different way which\ncannot be compared to any other;—or, My body is the _objectivity_ of my\nwill;—or, My body considered apart from the fact that it is my idea is\nstill my will, and so forth.(27)",

    "page_content": "body as merely idea of the subject which knows it, like all the other\nobjects of this world of perception. But it has now become clear that what\nenables us consciously to distinguish our own body from all other objects\nwhich in other respects are precisely the same, is that our body appears\nin consciousness in quite another way _toto genere_ different from idea,\nand this we denote by the word _will_; and that it is just this double\nknowledge which we have of our own body that affords us information about\nit, about its action and movement following on motives, and also about\nwhat it experiences by means of external impressions; in a word, about\nwhat it is, not as idea, but as more than idea; that is to say, what it is\n_in itself_. None of this information have we got directly with regard to\nthe nature, action, and experience of other real objects.\n\nIt is just because of this special relation to one body that the knowing\nsubject is an individual. For regarded apart from this relation, his body\nis for him only an idea like all other ideas. But the relation through\nwhich the knowing subject is an _individual_, is just on that account a\nrelation which subsists only between him and one particular idea of all\nthose which he has. Therefore he is conscious of this _one_ idea, not\nmerely as an idea, but in quite a different way as a will. If, however, he\nabstracts from that special relation, from that twofold and completely\nheterogeneous knowledge of what is one and the same, then that _one_, the\nbody, is an idea like all other ideas. Therefore, in order to understand\nthe matter, the individual who knows must either assume that what\ndistinguishes that one idea from others is merely the fact that his\nknowledge stands in this double relation to it alone; that insight in two\nways at the same time is open to him only in the case of this one object\nof perception, and that this is to be explained not by the difference of\nthis object from all others, but only by the difference between the\nrelation of his knowledge to this one object, and its relation to all\nother objects. Or else he must assume that this object is essentially\ndifferent from all others; that it alone of all objects is at once both\nwill and idea, while the rest are only ideas, _i.e._, only phantoms. Thus\nhe must assume that his body is the only real individual in the world,\n_i.e._, the only phenomenon of will and the only immediate object of the\nsubject. That other objects, considered merely as _ideas_, are like his\nbody, that is, like it, fill space (which itself can only be present as\nidea), and also, like it, are causally active in space, is indeed\ndemonstrably certain from the law of causality which is _a priori_ valid\nfor ideas, and which admits of no effect without a cause; but apart from\nthe fact that we can only reason from an effect to a cause generally, and\nnot to a similar cause, we are still in the sphere of mere ideas, in which\nalone the law of causality is valid, and beyond which it can never take\nus. But whether the objects known to the individual only as ideas are yet,\nlike his own body, manifestations of a will, is, as was said in the First\nBook, the proper meaning of the question as to the reality of the external\nworld. To deny this is _theoretical egoism_, which on that account regards\nall phenomena that are outside its own will as phantoms, just as in a\npractical reference exactly the same thing is done by practical egoism.\nFor in it a man regards and treats himself alone as a person, and all\nother persons as mere phantoms. Theoretical egoism can never be\ndemonstrably refuted, yet in philosophy it has never been used otherwise\nthan as a sceptical sophism, _i.e._, a pretence. As a serious conviction,\non the other hand, it could only be found in a madhouse, and as such it\nstands in need of a cure rather than a refutation. We do not therefore\ncombat it any further in this regard, but treat it as merely the last\nstronghold of scepticism, which is always polemical. Thus our knowledge,\nwhich is always bound to individuality and is limited by this\ncircumstance, brings with it the necessity that each of us can only _be\none_, while, on the other hand, each of us can _know all_; and it is this\nlimitation that creates the need for philosophy. We therefore who, for\nthis very reason, are striving to extend the limits of our knowledge\nthrough philosophy, will treat this sceptical argument of theoretical\negoism which meets us, as an army would treat a small frontier fortress.\nThe fortress cannot indeed be taken, but the garrison can never sally\nforth from it, and therefore we pass it by without danger, and are not\nafraid to have it in our rear.\n\nThe double knowledge which each of us has of the nature and activity of\nhis own body, and which is given in two completely different ways, has now\nbeen clearly brought out. We shall accordingly make further use of it as a\nkey to the nature of every phenomenon in nature, and shall judge of all\nobjects which are not our own bodies, and are consequently not given to\nour consciousness in a double way but only as ideas, according to the\nanalogy of our own bodies, and shall therefore assume that as in one\naspect they are idea, just like our bodies, and in this respect are\nanalogous to them, so in another aspect, what remains of objects when we\nset aside their existence as idea of the subject, must in its inner nature\nbe the same as that in us which we call _will_. For what other kind of\nexistence or reality should we attribute to the rest of the material\nworld? Whence should we take the elements out of which we construct such a\nworld? Besides will and idea nothing is known to us or thinkable. If we\nwish to attribute the greatest known reality to the material world which\nexists immediately only in our idea, we give it the reality which our own\nbody has for each of us; for that is the most real thing for every one.\nBut if we now analyse the reality of this body and its actions, beyond the\nfact that it is idea, we find nothing in it except the will; with this its\nreality is exhausted. Therefore we can nowhere find another kind of\nreality which we can attribute to the material world. Thus if we hold that\nthe material world is something more than merely our idea, we must say\nthat besides being idea, that is, in itself and according to its inmost\nnature, it is that which we find immediately in ourselves as _will_. I say\naccording to its inmost nature; but we must first come to know more\naccurately this real nature of the will, in order that we may be able to\ndistinguish from it what does not belong to itself, but to its\nmanifestation, which has many grades. Such, for example, is the\ncircumstance of its being accompanied by knowledge, and the determination\nby motives which is conditioned by this knowledge. As we shall see farther\non, this does not belong to the real nature of will, but merely to its\ndistinct manifestation as an animal or a human being. If, therefore, I\nsay,—the force which attracts a stone to the earth is according to its\nnature, in itself, and apart from all idea, will, I shall not be supposed\nto express in this proposition the insane opinion that the stone moves\nitself in accordance with a known motive, merely because this is the way\nin which will appears in man.(28) We shall now proceed more clearly and in\ndetail to prove, establish, and develop to its full extent what as yet has\nonly been provisionally and generally explained.(29)",

    "page_content": "voluntary movements of our own body, as the inmost nature of this body, as\nthat which it is besides being object of perception, idea. For these\nvoluntary movements are nothing else than the visible aspect of the\nindividual acts of will, with which they are directly coincident and\nidentical, and only distinguished through the form of knowledge into which\nthey have passed, and in which alone they can be known, the form of idea.\n\nBut these acts of will have always a ground or reason outside themselves\nin motives. Yet these motives never determine more than what I will at\n_this_ time, in _this_ place, and under _these_ circumstances, not _that_\nI will in general, or _what_ I will in general, that is, the maxims which\ncharacterise my volition generally. Therefore the inner nature of my\nvolition cannot be explained from these motives; but they merely determine\nits manifestation at a given point of time: they are merely the occasion\nof my will showing itself; but the will itself lies outside the province\nof the law of motivation, which determines nothing but its appearance at\neach point of time. It is only under the presupposition of my empirical\ncharacter that the motive is a sufficient ground of explanation of my\naction. But if I abstract from my character, and then ask, why, in\ngeneral, I will this and not that, no answer is possible, because it is\nonly the manifestation of the will that is subject to the principle of\nsufficient reason, and not the will itself, which in this respect is to be\ncalled _groundless_. At this point I presuppose Kant’s doctrine of the\nempirical and intelligible character, and also my own treatment of the\nsubject in “The Fundamental Problems of Ethics,” pp. 48, 58, and 178, _et\nseq._, of first edition (p. 174, _et seq._, of second edition). I shall\nalso have to speak more fully on the question in the Fourth Book. For the\npresent, I have only to draw attention to this, that the fact of one\nmanifestation being established through another, as here the deed through\nthe motive, does not at all conflict with the fact that its real nature is\nwill, which itself has no _ground_; for as the principle of sufficient\nreason in all its aspects is only the form of knowledge, its validity\nextends only to the idea, to the phenomena, to the visibility of the will,\nbut not to the will itself, which becomes visible.\n\nIf now every action of my body is the manifestation of an act of will in\nwhich my will itself in general, and as a whole, thus my character,\nexpresses itself under given motives, manifestation of the will must be\nthe inevitable condition and presupposition of every action. For the fact\nof its manifestation cannot depend upon something which does not exist\ndirectly and only through it, which consequently is for it merely\naccidental, and through which its manifestation itself would be merely\naccidental. Now that condition is just the whole body itself. Thus the\nbody itself must be manifestation of the will, and it must be related to\nmy will as a whole, that is, to my intelligible character, whose\nphenomenal appearance in time is my empirical character, as the particular\naction of the body is related to the particular act of the will. The whole\nbody, then, must be simply my will become visible, must be my will itself,\nso far as this is object of perception, an idea of the first class. It has\nalready been advanced in confirmation of this that every impression upon\nmy body also affects my will at once and immediately, and in this respect\nis called pain or pleasure, or, in its lower degrees, agreeable or\ndisagreeable sensation; and also, conversely, that every violent movement\nof the will, every emotion or passion, convulses the body and disturbs the\ncourse of its functions. Indeed we can also give an etiological account,\nthough a very incomplete one, of the origin of my body, and a somewhat\nbetter account of its development and conservation, and this is the\nsubstance of physiology. But physiology merely explains its theme in\nprecisely the same way as motives explain action. Thus the physiological\nexplanation of the functions of the body detracts just as little from the\nphilosophical truth that the whole existence of this body and the sum\ntotal of its functions are merely the objectification of that will which\nappears in its outward actions in accordance with a motive, as the\nestablishment of the individual action through the motive and the\nnecessary sequence of the action from the motive conflicts with the fact\nthat action in general, and according to its nature, is only the\nmanifestation of a will which itself has no ground. If, however,\nphysiology tries to refer even these outward actions, the immediate\nvoluntary movements, to causes in the organism,—for example, if it\nexplains the movement of the muscles as resulting from the presence of\nfluids (“like the contraction of a cord when it is wet,” says Reil in his\n“Archiv für Physiologie,” vol. vi. p. 153), even supposing it really could\ngive a thorough explanation of this kind, yet this would never invalidate\nthe immediately certain truth that every voluntary motion (_functiones\nanimales_) is the manifestation of an act of will. Now, just as little can\nthe physiological explanation of vegetative life (_functiones naturales\nvitales_), however far it may advance, ever invalidate the truth that the\nwhole animal life which thus develops itself is the manifestation of will.\nIn general, then, as we have shown above, no etiological explanation can\never give us more than the necessarily determined position in time and\nspace of a particular manifestation, its necessary appearance there,\naccording to a fixed law; but the inner nature of everything that appears\nin this way remains wholly inexplicable, and is presupposed by every\netiological explanation, and merely indicated by the names, force, or law\nof nature, or, if we are speaking of action, character or will. Thus,\nalthough every particular action, under the presupposition of the definite\ncharacter, necessarily follows from the given motive, and although growth,\nthe process of nourishment, and all the changes of the animal body take\nplace according to necessarily acting causes (stimuli), yet the whole\nseries of actions, and consequently every individual act, and also its\ncondition, the whole body itself which accomplishes it, and therefore also\nthe process through which and in which it exists, are nothing but the\nmanifestation of the will, the becoming visible, _the objectification of\nthe will_. Upon this rests the perfect suitableness of the human and\nanimal body to the human and animal will in general, resembling, though\nfar surpassing, the correspondence between an instrument made for a\npurpose and the will of the maker, and on this account appearing as\ndesign, _i.e._, the teleological explanation of the body. The parts of the\nbody must, therefore, completely correspond to the principal desires\nthrough which the will manifests itself; they must be the visible\nexpression of these desires. Teeth, throat, and bowels are objectified\nhunger; the organs of generation are objectified sexual desire; the\ngrasping hand, the hurrying feet, correspond to the more indirect desires\nof the will which they express. As the human form generally corresponds to\nthe human will generally, so the individual bodily structure corresponds\nto the individually modified will, the character of the individual, and\ntherefore it is throughout and in all its parts characteristic and full of\nexpression. It is very remarkable that Parmenides already gave expression\nto this in the following verses, quoted by Aristotle (Metaph. iii. 5):—\n\n    Ὁς γαρ ἑκαστος εχει κρασιν μελεων πολυκαμπτων\n    Τως νοος ανθρωποισι παρεστηκεν; το γαρ αυτο\n    Εστιν, ὁπερ φρονεει, μελεων φυσις ανθρωποισι\n    Και πασιν και παντι; το γαρ πλεον εστι νοημα.\n\n(Ut enim cuique complexio membrorum flexibilium se habet, ita mens\nhominibus adest: idem namque est, quod sapit, membrorum natura hominibus,\net omnibus et omni: quod enim plus est, intelligentia est.)(30)",

He will\nrecognise this will of which we are speaking not only in those phenomenal\nexistences which exactly resemble his own, in men and animals as their\ninmost nature, but the course of reflection will lead him to recognise the\nforce which germinates and vegetates in the plant, and indeed the force\nthrough which the crystal is formed, that by which the magnet turns to the\nnorth pole, the force whose shock he experiences from the contact of two\ndifferent kinds of metals, the force which appears in the elective\naffinities of matter as repulsion and attraction, decomposition and\ncombination, and, lastly, even gravitation, which acts so powerfully\nthroughout matter, draws the stone to the earth and the earth to the\nsun,—all these, I say, he will recognise as different only in their\nphenomenal existence, but in their inner nature as identical, as that\nwhich is directly known to him so intimately and so much better than\nanything else, and which in its most distinct manifestation is called\n_will_. It is this application of reflection alone that prevents us from\nremaining any longer at the phenomenon, and leads us to the _thing in\nitself_. Phenomenal existence is idea and nothing more. All idea, of\nwhatever kind it may be, all _object_, is _phenomenal_ existence, but the\n_will_ alone is a _thing in itself_.

    "page_content": "to retain the Kantian expression as a standing formula), which, as such,\nis never object, because all object is its mere manifestation, and\ntherefore cannot be it itself, we must borrow for it the name and concept\nof an object, of something in some way objectively given, consequently of\none of its own manifestations. But in order to serve as a clue for the\nunderstanding, this can be no other than the most complete of all its\nmanifestations, _i.e._, the most distinct, the most developed, and\ndirectly enlightened by knowledge. Now this is the human will. It is,\nhowever, well to observe that here, at any rate, we only make use of a\n_denominatio a potiori_, through which, therefore, the concept of will\nreceives a greater extension than it has hitherto had. Knowledge of the\nidentical in different phenomena, and of difference in similar phenomena,\nis, as Plato so often remarks, a _sine qua non_ of philosophy. But\nhitherto it was not recognised that every kind of active and operating\nforce in nature is essentially identical with will, and therefore the\nmultifarious kinds of phenomena were not seen to be merely different\nspecies of the same genus, but were treated as heterogeneous. Consequently\nthere could be no word to denote the concept of this genus. I therefore\nname the genus after its most important species, the direct knowledge of\nwhich lies nearer to us and guides us to the indirect knowledge of all\nother species. But whoever is incapable of carrying out the required\nextension of the concept will remain involved in a permanent\nmisunderstanding. For by the word _will_ he understands only that species\nof it which has hitherto been exclusively denoted by it, the will which is\nguided by knowledge, and whose manifestation follows only upon motives,\nand indeed merely abstract motives, and thus takes place under the\nguidance of the reason. This, we have said, is only the most prominent\nexample of the manifestation of will. We must now distinctly separate in\nthought the inmost essence of this manifestation which is known to us\ndirectly, and then transfer it to all the weaker, less distinct\nmanifestations of the same nature, and thus we shall accomplish the\ndesired extension of the concept of will. From another point of view I\nshould be equally misunderstood by any one who should think that it is all\nthe same in the end whether we denote this inner nature of all phenomena\nby the word _will_ or by any other. This would be the case if the\nthing-in-itself were something whose existence we merely _inferred_, and\nthus knew indirectly and only in the abstract. Then, indeed, we might call\nit what we pleased; the name would stand merely as the symbol of an\nunknown quantity. But the word _will_, which, like a magic spell,\ndiscloses to us the inmost being of everything in nature, is by no means\nan unknown quantity, something arrived at only by inference, but is fully\nand immediately comprehended, and is so familiar to us that we know and\nunderstand what will is far better than anything else whatever. The\nconcept of will has hitherto commonly been subordinated to that of force,\nbut I reverse the matter entirely, and desire that every force in nature\nshould be thought as will. It must not be supposed that this is mere\nverbal quibbling or of no consequence; rather, it is of the greatest\nsignificance and importance. For at the foundation of the concept of\nforce, as of all other concepts, there ultimately lies the knowledge in\nsense-perception of the objective world, that is to say, the phenomenon,\nthe idea; and the concept is constructed out of this. It is an abstraction\nfrom the province in which cause and effect reign, _i.e._, from ideas of\nperception, and means just the causal nature of causes at the point at\nwhich this causal nature is no further etiologically explicable, but is\nthe necessary presupposition of all etiological explanation. The concept\nwill, on the other hand, is of all possible concepts the only one which\nhas its source _not_ in the phenomenal, _not_ in the mere idea of\nperception, but comes from within, and proceeds from the most immediate\nconsciousness of each of us, in which each of us knows his own\nindividuality, according to its nature, immediately, apart from all form,\neven that of subject and object, and which at the same time is this\nindividuality, for here the subject and the object of knowledge are one.\nIf, therefore, we refer the concept of _force_ to that of _will_, we have\nin fact referred the less known to what is infinitely better known;\nindeed, to the one thing that is really immediately and fully known to us,\nand have very greatly extended our knowledge. If, on the contrary, we\nsubsume the concept of will under that of force, as has hitherto always\nbeen done, we renounce the only immediate knowledge which we have of the\ninner nature of the world, for we allow it to disappear in a concept which\nis abstracted from the phenomenal, and with which we can therefore never\ngo beyond the phenomenal.",

    "page_content": "phenomenal appearance, and entirely free from all the forms of the\nphenomenal, into which it first passes when it manifests itself, and which\ntherefore only concern its _objectivity_, and are foreign to the will\nitself. Even the most universal form of all idea, that of being object for\na subject, does not concern it; still less the forms which are subordinate\nto this and which collectively have their common expression in the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, to which we know that time and space\nbelong, and consequently multiplicity also, which exists and is possible\nonly through these. In this last regard I shall call time and space the\n_principium individuationis_, borrowing an expression from the old\nschoolmen, and I beg to draw attention to this, once for all. For it is\nonly through the medium of time and space that what is one and the same,\nboth according to its nature and to its concept, yet appears as different,\nas a multiplicity of co-existent and successive phenomena. Thus time and\nspace are the _principium individuationis_, the subject of so many\nsubtleties and disputes among the schoolmen, which may be found collected\nin Suarez (Disp. 5, Sect. 3). According to what has been said, the will as\na thing-in-itself lies outside the province of the principle of sufficient\nreason in all its forms, and is consequently completely groundless,\nalthough all its manifestations are entirely subordinated to the principle\nof sufficient reason. Further, it is free from all _multiplicity_,\nalthough its manifestations in time and space are innumerable. It is\nitself one, though not in the sense in which an object is one, for the\nunity of an object can only be known in opposition to a possible\nmultiplicity; nor yet in the sense in which a concept is one, for the\nunity of a concept originates only in abstraction from a multiplicity; but\nit is one as that which lies outside time and space, the _principium\nindividuationis_, _i.e._, the possibility of multiplicity. Only when all\nthis has become quite clear to us through the subsequent examination of\nthe phenomena and different manifestations of the will, shall we fully\nunderstand the meaning of the Kantian doctrine that time, space and\ncausality do not belong to the thing-in-itself, but are only forms of\nknowing.\n\nThe uncaused nature of will has been actually recognised, where it\nmanifests itself most distinctly, as the will of man, and this has been\ncalled free, independent. But on account of the uncaused nature of the\nwill itself, the necessity to which its manifestation is everywhere\nsubjected has been overlooked, and actions are treated as free, which they\nare not. For every individual action follows with strict necessity from\nthe effect of the motive upon the character. All necessity is, as we have\nalready said, the relation of the consequent to the reason, and nothing\nmore. The principle of sufficient reason is the universal form of all\nphenomena, and man in his action must be subordinated to it like every\nother phenomenon. But because in self-consciousness the will is known\ndirectly and in itself, in this consciousness lies also the consciousness\nof freedom. The fact is, however, overlooked that the individual, the\nperson, is not will as a thing-in-itself, but is a _phenomenon_ of will,\nis already determined as such, and has come under the form of the\nphenomenal, the principle of sufficient reason. Hence arises the strange\nfact that every one believes himself _a priori_ to be perfectly free, even\nin his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence\nanother manner of life, which just means that he can become another\nperson. But _a posteriori_, through experience, he finds to his\nastonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity; that in\nspite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his\nconduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must\ncarry out the very character which he himself condemns, and as it were\nplay the part he has undertaken to the end. I cannot pursue this subject\nfurther at present, for it belongs, as ethical, to another part of this\nwork. In the meantime, I only wish to point out here that the _phenomenon_\nof the will which in itself is uncaused, is yet as such subordinated to\nthe law of necessity, that is, the principle of sufficient reason, so that\nin the necessity with which the phenomena of nature follow each other, we\nmay find nothing to hinder us from recognising in them the manifestations\nof will.\n\nOnly those changes which have no other ground than a motive, _i.e._, an\nidea, have hitherto been regarded as manifestations of will. Therefore in\nnature a will has only been attributed to man, or at the most to animals;\nfor knowledge, the idea, is of course, as I have said elsewhere, the true\nand exclusive characteristic of animal life. But that the will is also\nactive where no knowledge guides it, we see at once in the instinct and\nthe mechanical skill of animals.(31) That they have ideas and knowledge is\nhere not to the point, for the end towards which they strive as definitely\nas if it were a known motive, is yet entirely unknown to them. Therefore\nin such cases their action takes place without motive, is not guided by\nthe idea, and shows us first and most distinctly how the will may be\nactive entirely without knowledge. The bird of a year old has no idea of\nthe eggs for which it builds a nest; the young spider has no idea of the\nprey for which it spins a web; nor has the ant-lion any idea of the ants\nfor which he digs a trench for the first time. The larva of the\nstag-beetle makes the hole in the wood, in which it is to await its\nmetamorphosis, twice as big if it is going to be a male beetle as if it is\ngoing to be a female, so that if it is a male there may be room for the\nhorns, of which, however, it has no idea. In such actions of these\ncreatures the will is clearly operative as in their other actions, but it\nis in blind activity, which is indeed accompanied by knowledge but not\nguided by it. If now we have once gained insight into the fact, that idea\nas motive is not a necessary and essential condition of the activity of\nthe will, we shall more easily recognise the activity of will where it is\nless apparent. For example, we shall see that the house of the snail is no\nmore made by a will which is foreign to the snail itself, than the house\nwhich we build is produced through another will than our own; but we shall\nrecognise in both houses the work of a will which objectifies itself in\nboth the phenomena—a will which works in us according to motives, but in\nthe snail still blindly as formative impulse directed outwards. In us also\nthe same will is in many ways only blindly active: in all the functions of\nour body which are not guided by knowledge, in all its vital and\nvegetative processes, digestion, circulation, secretion, growth,\nreproduction. Not only the actions of the body, but the whole body itself\nis, as we have shown above, phenomenon of the will, objectified will,\nconcrete will. All that goes on in it must therefore proceed through will,\nalthough here this will is not guided by knowledge, but acts blindly\naccording to causes, which in this case are called _stimuli_.\n\nI call a _cause_, in the narrowest sense of the word, that state of\nmatter, which, while it introduces another state with necessity, yet\nsuffers just as great a change itself as that which it causes; which is\nexpressed in the rule, “action and reaction are equal.” Further, in the\ncase of what is properly speaking a cause, the effect increases directly\nin proportion to the cause, and therefore also the reaction. So that, if\nonce the mode of operation be known, the degree of the effect may be\nmeasured and calculated from the degree of the intensity of the cause; and\nconversely the degree of the intensity of the cause may be calculated from\nthe degree of the effect. Such causes, properly so called, operate in all\nthe phenomena of mechanics, chemistry, and so forth; in short, in all the\nchanges of unorganised bodies. On the other hand, I call a _stimulus_,\nsuch a cause as sustains no reaction proportional to its effect, and the\nintensity of which does not vary directly in proportion to the intensity\nof its effect, so that the effect cannot be measured by it. On the\ncontrary, a small increase of the stimulus may cause a very great increase\nof the effect, or conversely, it may eliminate the previous effect\naltogether, and so forth. All effects upon organised bodies as such are of\nthis kind. All properly organic and vegetative changes of the animal body\nmust therefore be referred to stimuli, not to mere causes. But the\nstimulus, like every cause and motive generally, never determines more\nthan the point of time and space at which the manifestation of every force\nis to take place, and does not determine the inner nature of the force\nitself which is manifested. This inner nature we know, from our previous\ninvestigation, is will, to which therefore we ascribe both the unconscious\nand the conscious changes of the body. The stimulus holds the mean, forms\nthe transition between the motive, which is causality accompanied\nthroughout by knowledge, and the cause in the narrowest sense. In\nparticular cases it is sometimes nearer a motive, sometimes nearer a\ncause, but yet it can always be distinguished from both. Thus, for\nexample, the rising of the sap in a plant follows upon stimuli, and cannot\nbe explained from mere causes, according to the laws of hydraulics or\ncapillary attraction; yet it is certainly assisted by these, and\naltogether approaches very near to a purely causal change. On the other\nhand, the movements of the _Hedysarum gyrans_ and the _Mimosa pudica_,\nalthough still following upon mere stimuli, are yet very like movements\nwhich follow upon motives, and seem almost to wish to make the transition.\nThe contraction of the pupils of the eyes as the light is increased is due\nto stimuli, but it passes into movement which is due to motive; for it\ntakes place, because too strong lights would affect the retina painfully,\nand to avoid this we contract the pupils. The occasion of an erection is a\nmotive, because it is an idea, yet it operates with the necessity of a\nstimulus, _i.e._, it cannot be resisted, but we must put the idea away in\norder to make it cease to affect us. This is also the case with disgusting\nthings, which excite the desire to vomit. Thus we have treated the\ninstinct of animals as an actual link, of quite a distinct kind, between\nmovement following upon stimuli, and action following upon a known motive.\nNow we might be asked to regard breathing as another link of this kind. It\nhas been disputed whether it belongs to the voluntary or the involuntary\nmovements, that is to say, whether it follows upon motive or stimulus, and\nperhaps it may be explained as something which is between the two.\nMarshall Hall (“On the Diseases of the Nervous System,” § 293 sq.)\nexplains it as a mixed function, for it is partly under the influence of\nthe cerebral (voluntary), and partly under that of the spinal\n(non-voluntary) nerves. However, we are finally obliged to number it with\nthe expressions of will which result from motives. For other motives,\n_i.e._, mere ideas, can determine the will to check it or accelerate it,\nand, as is the case with every other voluntary action, it seems to us that\nwe could give up breathing altogether and voluntarily suffocate. And in\nfact we could do so if any other motive influenced the will sufficiently\nstrongly to overcome the pressing desire for air. According to some\naccounts Diogenes actually put an end to his life in this way (Diog.\nLaert. VI. 76). Certain negroes also are said to have done this (F. B.\nOsiander “On Suicide” [1813] pp. 170-180). If this be true, it affords us\na good example of the influence of abstract motives, _i.e._, of the\nvictory of distinctively rational over merely animal will. For, that\nbreathing is at least partially conditioned by cerebral activity is shown\nby the fact that the primary cause of death from prussic acid is that it\nparalyses the brain, and so, indirectly, restricts the breathing; but if\nthe breathing be artificially maintained till the stupefaction of the\nbrain has passed away, death will not ensue. We may also observe in\npassing that breathing affords us the most obvious example of the fact\nthat motives act with just as much necessity as stimuli, or as causes in\nthe narrowest sense of the word, and their operation can only be\nneutralised by antagonistic motives, as action is neutralised by\nre-action. For, in the case of breathing, the illusion that we can stop\nwhen we like is much weaker than in the case of other movements which\nfollow upon motives; because in breathing the motive is very powerful,\nvery near to us, and its satisfaction is very easy, for the muscles which\naccomplish it are never tired, nothing, as a rule, obstructs it, and the\nwhole process is supported by the most inveterate habit of the individual.\nAnd yet all motives act with the same necessity. The knowledge that\nnecessity is common to movements following upon motives, and those\nfollowing upon stimuli, makes it easier for us to understand that that\nalso which takes place in our bodily organism in accordance with stimuli\nand in obedience to law, is yet, according to its inner nature—will, which\nin all its manifestations, though never in itself, is subordinated to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, that is, to necessity.(32) Accordingly, we\nshall not rest contented with recognising that animals, both in their\nactions and also in their whole existence, bodily structure and\norganisation, are manifestations of will; but we shall extend to plants\nalso this immediate knowledge of the essential nature of things which is\ngiven to us alone. Now all the movements of plants follow upon stimuli;\nfor the absence of knowledge, and the movement following upon motives\nwhich is conditioned by knowledge, constitutes the only essential\ndifference between animals and plants. Therefore, what appears for the\nidea as plant life, as mere vegetation, as blindly impelling force, we\nshall claim, according to its inner nature, for will, and recognise it as\njust that which constitutes the basis of our own phenomenal being, as it\nexpresses itself in our actions, and also in the whole existence of our\nbody itself.\n\nIt only remains for us to take the final step, the extension of our way of\nlooking at things to all those forces which act in nature in accordance\nwith universal, unchangeable laws, in conformity with which the movements\nof all those bodies take place, which are wholly without organs, and have\ntherefore no susceptibility for stimuli, and have no knowledge, which is\nthe necessary condition of motives. Thus we must also apply the key to the\nunderstanding of the inner nature of things, which the immediate knowledge\nof our own existence alone can give us, to those phenomena of the\nunorganised world which are most remote from us. And if we consider them\nattentively, if we observe the strong and unceasing impulse with which the\nwaters hurry to the ocean, the persistency with which the magnet turns\never to the north pole, the readiness with which iron flies to the magnet,\nthe eagerness with which the electric poles seek to be re-united, and\nwhich, just like human desire, is increased by obstacles; if we see the\ncrystal quickly and suddenly take form with such wonderful regularity of\nconstruction, which is clearly only a perfectly definite and accurately\ndetermined impulse in different directions, seized and retained by\ncrystallisation; if we observe the choice with which bodies repel and\nattract each other, combine and separate, when they are set free in a\nfluid state, and emancipated from the bonds of rigidness; lastly, if we\nfeel directly how a burden which hampers our body by its gravitation\ntowards the earth, unceasingly presses and strains upon it in pursuit of\nits one tendency; if we observe all this, I say, it will require no great\neffort of the imagination to recognise, even at so great a distance, our\nown nature. That which in us pursues its ends by the light of knowledge;\nbut here, in the weakest of its manifestations, only strives blindly and\ndumbly in a one-sided and unchangeable manner, must yet in both cases come\nunder the name of will, as it is everywhere one and the same—just as the\nfirst dim light of dawn must share the name of sunlight with the rays of\nthe full mid-day. For the name _will_ denotes that which is the inner\nnature of everything in the world, and the one kernel of every phenomenon.\n\nYet the remoteness, and indeed the appearance of absolute difference\nbetween the phenomena of unorganised nature and the will which we know as\nthe inner reality of our own being, arises chiefly from the contrast\nbetween the completely determined conformity to law of the one species of\nphenomena, and the apparently unfettered freedom of the other. For in man,\nindividuality makes itself powerfully felt. Every one has a character of\nhis own; and therefore the same motive has not the same influence over\nall, and a thousand circumstances which exist in the wide sphere of the\nknowledge of the individual, but are unknown to others, modify its effect.\nTherefore action cannot be predetermined from the motive alone, for the\nother factor is wanting, the accurate acquaintance with the individual\ncharacter, and with the knowledge which accompanies it. On the other hand,\nthe phenomena of the forces of nature illustrate the opposite extreme.\nThey act according to universal laws, without variation, without\nindividuality in accordance with openly manifest circumstances, subject to\nthe most exact predetermination; and the same force of nature appears in\nits million phenomena in precisely the same way. In order to explain this\npoint and prove the identity of the _one_ indivisible will in all its\ndifferent phenomena, in the weakest as in the strongest, we must first of\nall consider the relation of the will as thing-in-itself to its phenomena,\nthat is, the relation of the world as will to the world as idea; for this\nwill open to us the best way to a more thorough investigation of the whole\nsubject we are considering in this second book.(33)",

    "page_content": "with their entire constitution, and the possibility of all their forms,\nare present in our consciousness quite independently of the objects which\nappear in them, and which constitute their content; or, in other words,\nthey can be arrived at just as well if we start from the subject as if we\nstart from the object. Therefore, with equal accuracy, we may call them\neither forms of intuition or perception of the subject, or qualities of\nthe object _as object_ (with Kant, phenomenon), _i.e._, _idea_. We may\nalso regard these forms as the irreducible boundary between object and\nsubject. All objects must therefore exist in them, yet the subject,\nindependently of the phenomenal object, possesses and surveys them\ncompletely. But if the objects appearing in these forms are not to be\nempty phantoms, but are to have a meaning, they must refer to something,\nmust be the expression of something which is not, like themselves, object,\nidea, a merely relative existence for a subject, but which exists without\nsuch dependence upon something which stands over against it as a condition\nof its being, and independent of the forms of such a thing, _i.e._, _is\nnot idea_, but a _thing-in-itself_. Consequently it may at least be asked:\nAre these ideas, these objects, something more than or apart from the fact\nthat they are ideas, objects of the subject? And what would they be in\nthis sense? What is that other side of them which is _toto genere_\ndifferent from idea? What is the thing-in-itself? _The will_, we have\nanswered, but for the present I set that answer aside.\n\nWhatever the thing-in-itself may be, Kant is right in his conclusion that\ntime, space, and causality (which we afterwards found to be forms of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, the general expression of the forms of the\nphenomenon) are not its properties, but come to it only after, and so far\nas, it has become idea. That is, they belong only to its phenomenal\nexistence, not to itself. For since the subject fully understands and\nconstructs them out of itself, independently of all object, they must be\ndependent upon _existence as idea_ as such, not upon that which becomes\nidea. They must be the form of the idea as such; but not qualities of that\nwhich has assumed this form. They must be already given with the mere\nantithesis of subject and object (not as concepts but as facts), and\nconsequently they must be only the more exact determination of the form of\nknowledge in general, whose most universal determination is that\nantithesis itself. Now, that in the phenomenon, in the object, which is in\nits turn conditioned by time, space and causality, inasmuch as it can only\nbecome idea by means of them, namely _multiplicity_, through co-existence\nand succession, _change_ and _permanence_ through the law of causality,\n_matter_ which can only become idea under the presupposition of causality,\nand lastly, all that becomes idea only by means of these,—all this, I say,\nas a whole, does not in reality belong to that which appears, to that\nwhich has passed into the form of idea, but belongs merely to this form\nitself. And conversely, that in the phenomenon which is not conditioned\nthrough time, space and causality, and which cannot be referred to them,\nnor explained in accordance with them, is precisely that in which the\nthing manifested, the thing-in-itself, directly reveals itself. It follows\nfrom this that the most complete capacity for being known, that is to say,\nthe greatest clearness, distinctness, and susceptibility of exhaustive\nexplanation, will necessarily belong to that which pertains to knowledge\n_as such_, and thus to the _form_ of knowledge; but not to that which in\nitself is not idea, not object, but which has become knowledge only\nthrough entering these forms; in other words, has become idea, object.\nThus only that which depends entirely upon being an object of knowledge,\nupon existing as idea in general and _as such_ (not upon that which\n_becomes_ known, and has only _become_ idea), which therefore belongs\nwithout distinction to everything that is known, and which, on that\naccount, is found just as well if we start from the subject as if we start\nfrom the object,—this alone can afford us without reserve a sufficient,\nexhaustive knowledge, a knowledge which is clear to the very foundation.\nBut this consists of nothing but those forms of all phenomena of which we\nare conscious _a priori_, and which may be generally expressed as the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Now, the forms of this principle which\noccur in knowledge of perception (with which alone we are here concerned)\nare time, space, and causality. The whole of pure mathematics and pure\nnatural science _a priori_ is based entirely upon these. Therefore it is\nonly in these sciences that knowledge finds no obscurity, does not rest\nupon what is incomprehensible (groundless, _i.e._, will), upon what cannot\nbe further deduced. It is on this account that Kant wanted, as we have\nsaid, to apply the name science specially and even exclusively to these\nbranches of knowledge together with logic. But, on the other hand, these\nbranches of knowledge show us nothing more than mere connections,\nrelations of one idea to another, form devoid of all content. All content\nwhich they receive, every phenomenon which fills these forms, contains\nsomething which is no longer completely knowable in its whole nature,\nsomething which can no longer be entirely explained through something\nelse, something then which is groundless, through which consequently the\nknowledge loses its evidence and ceases to be completely lucid. This that\nwithholds itself from investigation, however, is the thing-in-itself, is\nthat which is essentially not idea, not object of knowledge, but has only\nbecome knowable by entering that form. The form is originally foreign to\nit, and the thing-in-itself can never become entirely one with it, can\nnever be referred to mere form, and, since this form is the principle of\nsufficient reason, can never be completely explained. If therefore all\nmathematics affords us an exhaustive knowledge of that which in the\nphenomena is quantity, position, number, in a word, spatial and temporal\nrelations; if all etiology gives us a complete account of the regular\nconditions under which phenomena, with all their determinations, appear in\ntime and space, but, with it all, teaches us nothing more than why in each\ncase this particular phenomenon must appear just at this time here, and at\nthis place now; it is clear that with their assistance we can never\npenetrate to the inner nature of things. There always remains something\nwhich no explanation can venture to attack, but which it always\npresupposes; the forces of nature, the definite mode of operation of\nthings, the quality and character of every phenomenon, that which is\nwithout ground, that which does not depend upon the form of the\nphenomenal, the principle of sufficient reason, but is something to which\nthis form in itself is foreign, something which has yet entered this form,\nand now appears according to its law, a law, however, which only\ndetermines the appearance, not that which appears, only the how, not the\nwhat, only the form, not the content. Mechanics, physics, and chemistry\nteach the rules and laws according to which the forces of impenetrability,\ngravitation, rigidity, fluidity, cohesion, elasticity, heat, light,\naffinity, magnetism, electricity, &c., operate; that is to say, the law,\nthe rule which these forces observe whenever they enter time and space.\nBut do what we will, the forces themselves remain _qualitates occultæ_.\nFor it is just the thing-in-itself, which, because it is manifested,\nexhibits these phenomena, which are entirely different from itself. In its\nmanifestation, indeed, it is completely subordinated to the principle of\nsufficient reason as the form of the idea, but it can never itself be\nreferred to this form, and therefore cannot be fully explained\netiologically, can never be completely fathomed. It is certainly perfectly\ncomprehensible so far as it has assumed that form, that is, so far as it\nis phenomenon, but its inner nature is not in the least explained by the\nfact that it can thus be comprehended. Therefore the more necessity any\nknowledge carries with it, the more there is in it of that which cannot be\notherwise thought or presented in perception—as, for example,\nspace-relations—the clearer and more sufficing then it is, the less pure\nobjective content it has, or the less reality, properly so called, is\ngiven in it. And conversely, the more there is in it which must be\nconceived as mere chance, and the more it impresses us as given merely\nempirically, the more proper objectivity and true reality is there in such\nknowledge, and at the same time, the more that is inexplicable, that is,\nthat cannot be deduced from anything else.\n\nIt is true that at all times an etiology, unmindful of its real aim, has\nstriven to reduce all organised life to chemism or electricity; all\nchemism, that is to say quality, again to mechanism (action determined by\nthe shape of the atom), this again sometimes to the object of phoronomy,\n_i.e._, the combination of time and space, which makes motion possible,\nsometimes to the object of mere geometry, _i.e._, position in space (much\nin the same way as we rightly deduce the diminution of an effect from the\nsquare of the distance, and the theory of the lever in a purely\ngeometrical manner): geometry may finally be reduced to arithmetic, which,\non account of its one dimension, is of all the forms of the principle of\nsufficient reason, the most intelligible, comprehensible, and completely\nsusceptible of investigation. As instances of the method generally\nindicated here, we may refer to the atoms of Democritus, the vortex of\nDescartes, the mechanical physics of Lesage, which towards the end of last\ncentury tried to explain both chemical affinities and gravitation\nmechanically by impact and pressure, as may be seen in detail in “_Lucrèce\nNeutonien_;” Reil’s form and combination as the cause of animal life, also\ntends in this direction. Finally, the crude materialism which even now in\nthe middle of the nineteenth century has been served up again under the\nignorant delusion that it is original, belongs distinctly to this class.\nIt stupidly denies vital force, and first of all tries to explain the\nphenomena of life from physical and chemical forces, and those again from\nthe mechanical effects of the matter, position, form, and motion of\nimagined atoms, and thus seeks to reduce all the forces of nature to\naction and reaction as its thing-in-itself. According to this teaching,\nlight is the mechanical vibration or undulation of an imaginary ether,\npostulated for this end. This ether, if it reaches the eye, beats rapidly\nupon the retina, and gives us the knowledge of colour. Thus, for example,\nfour hundred and eighty-three billion beats in a second give red, and\nseven hundred and twenty-seven billion beats in a second give violet. Upon\nthis theory, persons who are colour-blind must be those who are unable to\ncount the beats, must they not? Such crass, mechanical, clumsy, and\ncertainly knotty theories, which remind one of Democritus, are quite\nworthy of those who, fifty years after the appearance of Goethe’s doctrine\nof colour, still believe in Newton’s homogeneous light, and are not\nashamed to say so. They will find that what is overlooked in the child\n(Democritus) will not be forgiven to the man. They might indeed, some day,\ncome to an ignominious end; but then every one would slink away and\npretend that he never had anything to do with them. We shall soon have to\nspeak again of this false reduction of the forces of nature to each other;\nso much for the present. Supposing this theory were possible, all would\ncertainly be explained and established and finally reduced to an\narithmetical problem, which would then be the holiest thing in the temple\nof wisdom, to which the principle of sufficient reason would at last have\nhappily conducted us. But all content of the phenomenon would have\ndisappeared, and the mere form would remain. The “what appears” would be\nreferred to the “how it appears,” and this “how” would be what is _a\npriori_ knowable, therefore entirely dependent on the subject, therefore\nonly for the subject, therefore, lastly, mere phantom, idea and form of\nidea, through and through: no thing-in-itself could be demanded.\nSupposing, then, that this were possible, the whole world would be derived\nfrom the subject, and in fact, that would be accomplished which Fichte\nwanted to _seem_ to accomplish by his empty bombast. But it is not\npossible: phantasies, sophisms, castles in the air, have been constructed\nin this way, but science never. The many and multifarious phenomena in\nnature have been successfully referred to particular original forces, and\nas often as this has been done, a real advance has been made. Several\nforces and qualities, which were at first regarded as different, have been\nderived from each other, and thus their number has been curtailed. (For\nexample, magnetism from electricity.) Etiology will have reached its goal\nwhen it has recognised and exhibited as such all the original forces of\nnature, and established their mode of operation, _i.e._, the law according\nto which, under the guidance of causality, their phenomena appear in time\nand space, and determine their position with regard to each other. But\ncertain original forces will always remain over; there will always remain\nas an insoluble residuum a content of phenomena which cannot be referred\nto their form, and thus cannot be explained from something else in\naccordance with the principle of sufficient reason. For in everything in\nnature there is something of which no ground can ever be assigned, of\nwhich no explanation is possible, and no ulterior cause is to be sought.\nThis is the specific nature of its action, _i.e._, the nature of its\nexistence, its being. Of each particular effect of the thing a cause may\nbe certainly indicated, from which it follows that it must act just at\nthis time and in this place; but no cause can ever be found from which it\nfollows that a thing acts in general, and precisely in the way it does. If\nit has no other qualities, if it is merely a mote in a sunbeam, it yet\nexhibits this unfathomable something, at least as weight and\nimpenetrability. But this, I say, is to the mote what his will is to a\nman; and, like the human will, it is, according to its inner nature, not\nsubject to explanation; nay, more—it is in itself identical with this\nwill. It is true that a motive may be given for every manifestation of\nwill, for every act of will at a particular time and in a particular\nplace, upon which it must necessarily follow, under the presupposition of\nthe character of the man. But no reason can ever be given that the man has\nthis character; that he wills at all; that, of several motives, just this\none and no other, or indeed that any motive at all, moves his will. That\nwhich in the case of man is the unfathomable character which is\npresupposed in every explanation of his actions from motives is, in the\ncase of every unorganised body, its definitive quality—the mode of its\naction, the manifestations of which are occasioned by impressions from\nwithout, while it itself, on the contrary, is determined by nothing\noutside itself, and thus is also inexplicable. Its particular\nmanifestations, through which alone it becomes visible, are subordinated\nto the principle of sufficient reason; it itself is groundless. This was\nin substance rightly understood by the schoolmen, who called it _forma\nsubstantialis_. (Cf. Suarez, Disput. Metaph., disp. xv. sect. 1.)\n\nIt is a greater and a commoner error that the phenomena which we best\nunderstand are those which are of most frequent occurrence, and which are\nmost universal and simple; for, on the contrary, these are just the\nphenomena that we are most accustomed to see about us, and to be ignorant\nof. It is just as inexplicable to us that a stone should fall to the earth\nas that an animal should move itself. It has been supposed, as we have\nremarked above, that, starting from the most universal forces of nature\n(gravitation, cohesion, impenetrability), it was possible to explain from\nthem the rarer forces, which only operate under a combination of\ncircumstances (for example, chemical quality, electricity, magnetism),\nand, lastly, from these to understand the organism and the life of\nanimals, and even the nature of human knowing and willing. Men resigned\nthemselves without a word to starting from mere _qualitates occultæ_, the\nelucidation of which was entirely given up, for they intended to build\nupon them, not to investigate them. Such an intention cannot, as we have\nalready said, be carried out. But apart from this, such structures would\nalways stand in the air. What is the use of explanations which ultimately\nrefer us to something which is quite as unknown as the problem with which\nwe started? Do we in the end understand more of the inner nature of these\nuniversal natural forces than of the inner nature of an animal? Is not the\none as much a sealed book to us as the other? Unfathomable because it is\nwithout ground, because it is the content, that which the phenomenon is,\nand which can never be referred to the form, to the how, to the principle\nof sufficient reason. But we, who have in view not etiology but\nphilosophy, that is, not relative but unconditioned knowledge of the real\nnature of the world, take the opposite course, and start from that which\nis immediately and most completely known to us, and fully and entirely\ntrusted by us—that which lies nearest to us, in order to understand that\nwhich is known to us only at a distance, one-sidedly and indirectly. From\nthe most powerful, most significant, and most distinct phenomenon we seek\nto arrive at an understanding of those that are less complete and weaker.\nWith the exception of my own body, all things are known to me only on\n_one_ side, that of the idea. Their inner nature remains hidden from me\nand a profound secret, even if I know all the causes from which their\nchanges follow. Only by comparison with that which goes on in me if my\nbody performs an action when I am influenced by a motive—only by\ncomparison, I say, with what is the inner nature of my own changes\ndetermined by external reasons, can I obtain insight into the way in which\nthese lifeless bodies change under the influence of causes, and so\nunderstand what is their inner nature. For the knowledge of the causes of\nthe manifestation of this inner nature affords me merely the rule of its\nappearance in time and space, and nothing more. I can make this comparison\nbecause my body is the only object of which I know not merely the _one_\nside, that of the idea, but also the other side which is called will.\nThus, instead of believing that I would better understand my own\norganisation, and then my own knowing and willing, and my movements\nfollowing upon motives, if I could only refer them to movements due to\nelectrical, chemical, and mechanical causes, I must, seeing that I seek\nphilosophy and not etiology, learn to understand from my own movements\nfollowing upon motives the inner nature of the simplest and commonest\nmovements of an unorganised body which I see following upon causes. I must\nrecognise the inscrutable forces which manifest themselves in all natural\nbodies as identical in kind with that which in me is the will, and as\ndiffering from it only in degree. That is to say, the fourth class of\nideas given in the Essay on the Principle of Sufficient Reason must be the\nkey to the knowledge of the inner nature of the first class, and by means\nof the law of motivation I must come to understand the inner meaning of\nthe law of causation.\n\nSpinoza (Epist. 62) says that if a stone which has been projected through\nthe air had consciousness, it would believe that it was moving of its own\nwill. I add to this only that the stone would be right. The impulse given\nit is for the stone what the motive is for me, and what in the case of the\nstone appears as cohesion, gravitation, rigidity, is in its inner nature\nthe same as that which I recognise in myself as will, and what the stone\nalso, if knowledge were given to it, would recognise as will. In the\npassage referred to, Spinoza had in view the necessity with which the\nstone flies, and he rightly desires to transfer this necessity to that of\nthe particular act of will of a person. I, on the other hand, consider the\ninner being, which alone imparts meaning and validity to all real\nnecessity (_i.e._, effect following upon a cause) as its presupposition.\nIn the case of men this is called character; in the case of a stone it is\ncalled quality, but it is the same in both. When it is immediately known\nit is called will. In the stone it has the weakest, and in man the\nstrongest degree of visibility, of objectivity. St. Augustine recognises,\nwith a true instinct, this identity of the tendencies of all things with\nour own willing, and I cannot refrain from quoting his naïve account of\nthe matter:—“_Si pecora essemus, carnalem vitam et quod secundum sensum\nejusdem est amaremus, idque esset sufficiens bonum nostrum, et secundum\nhoc si esset nobis bene, nihil aliud quæreremus. Item, si arbores essemus,\nnihil quidem sentientes motu amare possemus: verumtamen id quasi appetere\nvideremur, quo feracius essemus, uberiusque fructuosæ. Si essemus lapides,\naut fluctus, aut ventus, aut flamma, vel quid ejusmodi, sine ullo quidem\nsensu atque vita, non tamen nobis deesset quasi quidam nostrorum locorum\natque ordinis appetitus. Nam velut amores corporum momenta sunt ponderum,\nsive deorsum gravitate, sive sursum levitate nitantur: ita enim corpus\npondere, sicut animus amore fertur quocunque fertur_” (De Civ. Dei, xi.\n28).\n\nIt ought further to be mentioned that Euler saw that the inner nature of\ngravitation must ultimately be referred to an “inclination and desire”\n(thus will) peculiar to material bodies (in the 68th letter to the\nPrincess). Indeed, it is just this that makes him averse to the conception\nof gravitation as it existed for Newton, and he is inclined to try a\nmodification of it in accordance with the earlier Cartesian theory, and so\nto derive gravitation from the impact of an ether upon the bodies, as\nbeing “more rational and more suitable for persons who like clear and\nintelligible principles.” He wishes to banish attraction from physics as a\n_qualitas occulta_. This is only in keeping with the dead view of nature\nwhich prevailed at Euler’s time as the correlative of the immaterial soul.\nIt is only worth noticing because of its bearing upon the fundamental\ntruth established by me, which even at that time this fine intellect saw\nglimmering in the distance. He hastened to turn in time, and then, in his\nanxiety at seeing all the prevalent fundamental views endangered, he\nsought safety in the old and already exploded absurdities.\n\nWe know that _multiplicity_ in general is necessarily conditioned by space\nand time, and is only thinkable in them. In this respect they are called\nthe _principium individuationis_. But we have found that space and time\nare forms of the principle of sufficient reason. In this principle all our\nknowledge _a priori_ is expressed, but, as we showed above, this _a\npriori_ knowledge, as such, only applies to the knowableness of things,\nnot to the things themselves, _i.e._, it is only our form of knowledge, it\nis not a property of the thing-in-itself. The thing-in-itself is, as such,\nfree from all forms of knowledge, even the most universal, that of being\nan object for the subject. In other words, the thing-in-itself is\nsomething altogether different from the idea. If, now, this\nthing-in-itself is _the will_, as I believe I have fully and convincingly\nproved it to be, then, regarded as such and apart from its manifestation,\nit lies outside time and space, and therefore knows no multiplicity, and\nis consequently _one_. Yet, as I have said, it is not one in the sense in\nwhich an individual or a concept is one, but as something to which the\ncondition of the possibility of multiplicity, the _principium\nindividuationis_, is foreign. The multiplicity of things in space and\ntime, which collectively constitute the objectification of will, does not\naffect the will itself, which remains indivisible notwithstanding it. It\nis not the case that, in some way or other, a smaller part of will is in\nthe stone and a larger part in the man, for the relation of part and whole\nbelongs exclusively to space, and has no longer any meaning when we go\nbeyond this form of intuition or perception. The more and the less have\napplication only to the phenomenon of will, that is, its visibility, its\nobjectification. Of this there is a higher grade in the plant than in the\nstone; in the animal a higher grade than in the plant: indeed, the passage\nof will into visibility, its objectification, has grades as innumerable as\nexist between the dimmest twilight and the brightest sunshine, the loudest\nsound and the faintest echo. We shall return later to the consideration of\nthese grades of visibility which belong to the objectification of the\nwill, to the reflection of its nature. But as the grades of its\nobjectification do not directly concern the will itself, still less is it\nconcerned by the multiplicity of the phenomena of these different grades,\n_i.e._, the multitude of individuals of each form, or the particular\nmanifestations of each force. For this multiplicity is directly\nconditioned by time and space, into which the will itself never enters.\nThe will reveals itself as completely and as much in _one_ oak as in\nmillions. Their number and multiplication in space and time has no meaning\nwith regard to it, but only with regard to the multiplicity of individuals\nwho know in space and time, and who are themselves multiplied and\ndispersed in these. The multiplicity of these individuals itself belongs\nnot to the will, but only to its manifestation. We may therefore say that\nif, _per impossibile_, a single real existence, even the most\ninsignificant, were to be entirely annihilated, the whole world would\nnecessarily perish with it. The great mystic Angelus Silesius feels this\nwhen he says—\n\n    “I know God cannot live an instant without me,\n    He must give up the ghost if I should cease to be.”\n\nMen have tried in various ways to bring the immeasurable greatness of the\nmaterial universe nearer to the comprehension of us all, and then they\nhave seized the opportunity to make edifying remarks. They have referred\nperhaps to the relative smallness of the earth, and indeed of man; or, on\nthe contrary, they have pointed out the greatness of the mind of this man\nwho is so insignificant—the mind that can solve, comprehend, and even\nmeasure the greatness of the universe, and so forth. Now, all this is very\nwell, but to me, when I consider the vastness of the world, the most\nimportant point is this, that the thing-in-itself, whose manifestation is\nthe world—whatever else it may be—cannot have its true self spread out and\ndispersed after this fashion in boundless space, but that this endless\nextension belongs only to its manifestation. The thing-in-itself, on the\ncontrary, is present entire and undivided in every object of nature and in\nevery living being. Therefore we lose nothing by standing still beside any\nsingle individual thing, and true wisdom is not to be gained by measuring\nout the boundless world, or, what would be more to the purpose, by\nactually traversing endless space. It is rather to be attained by the\nthorough investigation of any individual thing, for thus we seek to arrive\nat a full knowledge and understanding of its true and peculiar nature.\n\nThe subject which will therefore be fully considered in the next book, and\nwhich has, doubtless, already presented itself to the mind of every\nstudent of Plato, is, that these different grades of the objectification\nof will which are manifested in innumerable individuals, and exist as\ntheir unattained types or as the eternal forms of things, not entering\nthemselves into time and space, which are the medium of individual things,\nbut remaining fixed, subject to no change, always being, never becoming,\nwhile the particular things arise and pass away, always become and never\nare,—that these _grades of the objectification of will_ are, I say, simply\n_Plato’s Ideas_. I make this passing reference to the matter here in order\nthat I may be able in future to use the word _Idea_ in this sense. In my\nwritings, therefore, the word is always to be understood in its true and\noriginal meaning given to it by Plato, and has absolutely no reference to\nthose abstract productions of dogmatising scholastic reason, which Kant\nhas inaptly and illegitimately used this word to denote, though Plato had\nalready appropriated and used it most fitly. By Idea, then, I understand\nevery definite and fixed grade of the objectification of will, so far as\nit is thing-in-itself, and therefore has no multiplicity. These grades are\nrelated to individual things as their eternal forms or prototypes. The\nshortest and most concise statement of this famous Platonic doctrine is\ngiven us by Diogenes Laertes (iii. 12): “ὁ Πλατων φησι, εν τῃ φυσει τας\nιδεας ἑσταναι, καθαπερ παραδειγματα, τα δ᾽ αλλα ταυταις εοικεναι, τουτων\nὁμοιωματα καθεστωτα”—(“_Plato ideas in natura velut exemplaria dixit\nsubsistere; cetera his esse similia, ad istarum similitudinem\nconsistentia_”). Of Kant’s misuse of the word I take no further notice;\nwhat it is needful to say about it will be found in the Appendix.",

    "page_content": "those most universal forces of nature which partly appear in all matter\nwithout exception, as gravity and impenetrability, and partly have shared\nthe given matter among them, so that certain of them reign in one species\nof matter and others in another species, constituting its specific\ndifference, as rigidity, fluidity, elasticity, electricity, magnetism,\nchemical properties and qualities of every kind. They are in themselves\nimmediate manifestations of will, just as much as human action; and as\nsuch they are groundless, like human character. Only their particular\nmanifestations are subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason,\nlike the particular actions of men. They themselves, on the other hand,\ncan never be called either effect or cause, but are the prior and\npresupposed conditions of all causes and effects through which their real\nnature unfolds and reveals itself. It is therefore senseless to demand a\ncause of gravity or electricity, for they are original forces. Their\nexpressions, indeed, take place in accordance with the law of cause and\neffect, so that every one of their particular manifestations has a cause,\nwhich is itself again just a similar particular manifestation which\ndetermines that this force must express itself here, must appear in space\nand time; but the force itself is by no means the effect of a cause, nor\nthe cause of an effect. It is therefore a mistake to say “gravity is the\ncause of a stone falling;” for the cause in this case is rather the\nnearness of the earth, because it attracts the stone. Take the earth away\nand the stone will not fall, although gravity remains. The force itself\nlies quite outside the chain of causes and effects, which presupposes\ntime, because it only has meaning in relation to it; but the force lies\noutside time. The individual change always has for its cause another\nchange just as individual as itself, and not the force of which it is the\nexpression. For that which always gives its efficiency to a cause, however\nmany times it may appear, is a force of nature. As such, it is groundless,\n_i.e._, it lies outside the chain of causes and outside the province of\nthe principle of sufficient reason in general, and is philosophically\nknown as the immediate objectivity of will, which is the “in-itself” of\nthe whole of nature; but in etiology, which in this reference is physics,\nit is set down as an original force, _i.e._, a _qualitas occulta_.\n\nIn the higher grades of the objectivity of will we see individuality\noccupy a prominent position, especially in the case of man, where it\nappears as the great difference of individual characters, _i.e._, as\ncomplete personality, outwardly expressed in strongly marked individual\nphysiognomy, which influences the whole bodily form. None of the brutes\nhave this individuality in anything like so high a degree, though the\nhigher species of them have a trace of it; but the character of the\nspecies completely predominates over it, and therefore they have little\nindividual physiognomy. The farther down we go, the more completely is\nevery trace of the individual character lost in the common character of\nthe species, and the physiognomy of the species alone remains. We know the\nphysiological character of the species, and from that we know exactly what\nis to be expected from the individual; while, on the contrary, in the\nhuman species every individual has to be studied and fathomed for himself,\nwhich, if we wish to forecast his action with some degree of certainty,\nis, on account of the possibility of concealment that first appears with\nreason, a matter of the greatest difficulty. It is probably connected with\nthis difference of the human species from all others, that the folds and\nconvolutions of the brain, which are entirely wanting in birds, and very\nweakly marked in rodents, are even in the case of the higher animals far\nmore symmetrical on both sides, and more constantly the same in each\nindividual, than in the case of human beings.(34) It is further to be\nregarded as a phenomenon of this peculiar individual character which\ndistinguishes men from all the lower animals, that in the case of the\nbrutes the sexual instinct seeks its satisfaction without observable\nchoice of objects, while in the case of man this choice is, in a purely\ninstinctive manner and independent of all reflection, carried so far that\nit rises into a powerful passion. While then every man is to be regarded\nas a specially determined and characterised phenomenon of will, and indeed\nto a certain extent as a special Idea, in the case of the brutes this\nindividual character as a whole is wanting, because only the species has a\nspecial significance. And the farther we go from man, the fainter becomes\nthe trace of this individual character, so that plants have no individual\nqualities left, except such as may be fully explained from the favourable\nor unfavourable external influences of soil, climate, and other accidents.\nFinally, in the inorganic kingdom of nature all individuality disappears.\nThe crystal alone is to be regarded as to a certain extent individual. It\nis a unity of the tendency in definite directions, fixed by\ncrystallisation, which makes the trace of this tendency permanent. It is\nat the same time a cumulative repetition of its primitive form, bound into\nunity by an idea, just as the tree is an aggregate of the single\ngerminating fibre which shows itself in every rib of the leaves, in every\nleaf, in every branch; which repeats itself, and to some extent makes each\nof these appear as a separate growth, nourishing itself from the greater\nas a parasite, so that the tree, resembling the crystal, is a systematic\naggregate of small plants, although only the whole is the complete\nexpression of an individual Idea, _i.e._, of this particular grade of the\nobjectification of will. But the individuals of the same species of\ncrystal can have no other difference than such as is produced by external\naccidents; indeed we can make at pleasure large or small crystals of every\nspecies. The individual, however, as such, that is, with traces of an\nindividual character, does not exist further in unorganised nature. All\nits phenomena are expressions of general forces of nature, _i.e._, of\nthose grades of the objectification of will which do not objectify\nthemselves (as is the case in organised nature), by means of the\ndifference of the individualities which collectively express the whole of\nthe Idea, but show themselves only in the species, and as a whole, without\nany variation in each particular example of it. Time, space, multiplicity,\nand existence conditioned by causes, do not belong to the will or to the\nIdea (the grade of the objectification of will), but only to their\nparticular phenomena. Therefore such a force of nature as, for example,\ngravity or electricity, must show itself as such in precisely the same way\nin all its million phenomena, and only external circumstances can modify\nthese. This unity of its being in all its phenomena, this unchangeable\nconstancy of the appearance of these, whenever, under the guidance of\ncausality, the necessary conditions are present, is called a _law of\nnature_. If such a law is once learned from experience, then the\nphenomenon of that force of nature, the character of which is expressed\nand laid down in it, may be accurately forecast and counted upon. But it\nis just this conformity to law of the phenomena of the lower grades of the\nobjectification of will which gives them such a different aspect from the\nphenomena of the same will in the higher, _i.e._, the more distinct,\ngrades of its objectification, in animals, and in men and their actions,\nwhere the stronger or weaker influence of the individual character and the\nsusceptibility to motives which often remain hidden from the spectator,\nbecause they lie in knowledge, has had the result that the identity of the\ninner nature of the two kinds of phenomena has hitherto been entirely\noverlooked.\n\nIf we start from the knowledge of the particular, and not from that of the\nIdea, there is something astonishing, and sometimes even terrible, in the\nabsolute uniformity of the laws of nature. It might astonish us that\nnature never once forgets her laws; that if, for example, it has once been\naccording to a law of nature that where certain materials are brought\ntogether under given conditions, a chemical combination will take place,\nor gas will be evolved, or they will go on fire; if these conditions are\nfulfilled, whether by our interposition or entirely by chance (and in this\ncase the accuracy is the more astonishing because unexpected), to-day just\nas well as a thousand years ago, the determined phenomenon will take place\nat once and without delay. We are most vividly impressed with the\nmarvellousness of this fact in the case of rare phenomena, which only\noccur under very complex circumstances, but which we are previously\ninformed will take place if these conditions are fulfilled. For example,\nwhen we are told that if certain metals, when arranged alternately in\nfluid with which an acid has been mixed, are brought into contact, silver\nleaf brought between the extremities of this combination will suddenly be\nconsumed in a green flame; or that under certain conditions the hard\ndiamond turns into carbonic acid. It is the ghostly omnipresence of\nnatural forces that astonishes us in such cases, and we remark here what\nin the case of phenomena which happen daily no longer strikes us, how the\nconnection between cause and effect is really as mysterious as that which\nis imagined between a magic formula and a spirit that must appear when\ninvoked by it. On the other hand, if we have attained to the philosophical\nknowledge that a force of nature is a definite grade of the\nobjectification of will, that is to say, a definite grade of that which we\nrecognise as our own inmost nature, and that this will, in itself, and\ndistinguished from its phenomena and their forms, lies outside time and\nspace, and that, therefore, the multiplicity, which is conditioned by time\nand space, does not belong to it, nor directly to the grade of its\nobjectification, _i.e._, the Idea, but only to the phenomena of the Idea;\nand if we remember that the law of causality has significance only in\nrelation to time and space, inasmuch as it determines the position of the\nmultitude of phenomena of the different Ideas in which the will reveals\nitself, governing the order in which they must appear; if, I say, in this\nknowledge the inner meaning of the great doctrine of Kant has been fully\ngrasped, the doctrine that time, space, and causality do not belong to the\nthing-in-itself, but merely to the phenomenon, that they are only the\nforms of our knowledge, not qualities of things in themselves; then we\nshall understand that this astonishment at the conformity to law and\naccurate operation of a force of nature, this astonishment at the complete\nsameness of all its million phenomena and the infallibility of their\noccurrence, is really like that of a child or a savage who looks for the\nfirst time through a glass with many facets at a flower, and marvels at\nthe complete similarity of the innumerable flowers which he sees, and\ncounts the leaves of each of them separately.\n\nThus every universal, original force of nature is nothing but a low grade\nof the objectification of will, and we call every such grade an eternal\n_Idea_ in Plato’s sense. But a _law of nature_ is the relation of the Idea\nto the form of its manifestation. This form is time, space, and causality,\nwhich are necessarily and inseparably connected and related to each other.\nThrough time and space the Idea multiplies itself in innumerable\nphenomena, but the order according to which it enters these forms of\nmultiplicity is definitely determined by the law of causality; this law is\nas it were the norm of the limit of these phenomena of different Ideas, in\naccordance with which time, space, and matter are assigned to them. This\nnorm is therefore necessarily related to the identity of the aggregate of\nexisting matter, which is the common substratum of all those different\nphenomena. If all these were not directed to that common matter in the\npossession of which they must be divided, there would be no need for such\na law to decide their claims. They might all at once and together fill a\nboundless space throughout an endless time. Therefore, because all these\nphenomena of the eternal Ideas are directed to one and the same matter,\nmust there be a rule for their appearance and disappearance; for if there\nwere not, they would not make way for each other. Thus the law of\ncausality is essentially bound up with that of the permanence of\nsubstance; they reciprocally derive significance from each other. Time and\nspace, again, are related to them in the same way. For time is merely the\npossibility of conflicting states of the same matter, and space is merely\nthe possibility of the permanence of the same matter under all sorts of\nconflicting states. Accordingly, in the preceding book we explained matter\nas the union of space and time, and this union shows itself as change of\nthe accidents in the permanence of the substance, of which causality or\nbecoming is the universal possibility. And accordingly, we said that\nmatter is through and through causality. We explained the understanding as\nthe subjective correlative of causality, and said matter (and thus the\nwhole world as idea) exists only for the understanding; the understanding\nis its condition, its supporter as its necessary correlative. I repeat all\nthis in passing, merely to call to mind what was demonstrated in the First\nBook, for it is necessary for the complete understanding of these two\nbooks that their inner agreement should be observed, since what is\ninseparably united in the actual world as its two sides, will and idea,\nhas, in order that we might understand each of them more clearly in\nisolation, been dissevered in these two books.\n\nIt may not perhaps be superfluous to elucidate further by an example how\nthe law of causality has meaning only in relation to time and space, and\nthe matter which consists in the union of the two. For it determines the\nlimits in accordance with which the phenomena of the forces of nature\ndivide themselves in the possession of matter, while the original forces\nof nature, as the immediate objectification of will, which, as a thing in\nitself, is not subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason, lie\noutside these forms, within which alone all etiological explanation has\nvalidity and meaning, and just on that account can never lead us to the\ninner reality of nature. For this purpose let us think of some kind of\nmachine constructed according to the laws of mechanics. Iron weights begin\nthe motion by their gravity; copper wheels resist by their rigidity,\naffect and raise each other and the lever by their impenetrability, and so\non. Here gravity, rigidity, and impenetrability are original unexplained\nforces; mechanics only gives us the condition under which, and the manner\nin which, they manifest themselves, appear, and govern a definite matter,\ntime, and place. If, now, a strong magnet is made to attract the iron of\nthe weight, and overcome its gravity, the movement of the machine stops,\nand the matter becomes forthwith the scene of quite a different force of\nnature—magnetism, of which etiology again gives no further explanation\nthan the condition under which it appears. Or let us suppose that the\ncopper discs of such a machine are laid upon zinc plates, and an acid\nsolution introduced between them. At once the same matter of the machine\nhas become subject to another original force, galvanism, which now governs\nit according to its own laws, and reveals itself in it through its\nphenomena; and etiology can again tell us nothing about this force except\nthe conditions under which, and the laws in accordance with which, it\nmanifests itself. Let us now raise the temperature and add pure acid; the\nwhole machine burns; that is to say, once more an entirely different force\nof nature, chemical energy, asserts at this time and in this place\nirresistible claims to this particular matter, and reveals itself in it as\nIdea, as a definite grade of the objectification of will. The calcined\nmetal thus produced now unites with an acid, and a salt is obtained which\nforms itself into crystals. These are the phenomena of another Idea, which\nin itself is again quite inexplicable, while the appearance of its\nphenomena is dependent upon certain conditions which etiology can give us.\nThe crystals dissolve, mix with other materials, and vegetation springs up\nfrom them—a new phenomenon of will: and so the same permanent matter may\nbe followed _ad infinitum_, to observe how now this and now that natural\nforce obtains a right to it and temporarily takes possession of it, in\norder to appear and reveal its own nature. The condition of this right,\nthe point of time and space at which it becomes valid, is given by\ncausality, but the explanation founded upon this law only extends thus\nfar. The force itself is a manifestation of will, and as such is not\nsubject to the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, that is, it is\ngroundless. It lies outside all time, is omnipresent, and seems as it were\nto wait constantly till the circumstances occur under which it can appear\nand take possession of a definite matter, supplanting the forces which\nhave reigned in it till then. All time exists only for the phenomena of\nsuch a force, and is without significance for the force itself. Through\nthousands of years chemical forces slumber in matter till the contact with\nthe reagents sets them free; then they appear; but time exists only for\nthe phenomena, not for the forces themselves. For thousands of years\ngalvanism slumbered in copper and zinc, and they lay quietly beside\nsilver, which must be consumed in flame as soon as all three are brought\ntogether under the required conditions. Even in the organic kingdom we see\na dry seed preserve the slumbering force through three thousand years, and\nwhen at last the favourable circumstances occur, grow up as a plant.(35)\n\nIf by this exposition the difference between a force of nature and all its\nphenomena has been made quite distinct; if we have seen clearly that the\nformer is the will itself at this particular grade of its objectification,\nbut that multiplicity comes to phenomena only through time and space, and\nthat the law of causality is nothing but the determination of the position\nof these phenomena in time and space; then we shall recognise the complete\ntruth and the deep meaning of Malebranche’s doctrine of occasional causes\n(_causes occasionelles_). It is well worth while comparing this doctrine\nof his, as he explains it in the “_Recherches de la Vérite_,” both in the\n3rd Chapter of the second part of the 6th Book, and in the\n_éclaircissements_ appended to this chapter, with this exposition of mine,\nand observing the complete agreement of the two doctrines in the case of\nsuch different systems of thought. Indeed I cannot help admiring how\nMalebranche, though thoroughly involved in the positive dogmas which his\nage inevitably forced upon him, yet, in such bonds and under such a\nburden, hit the truth so happily, so correctly, and even knew how to\ncombine it with these dogmas, at all events verbally.\n\nFor the power of truth is incredibly great and of unspeakable endurance.\nWe find constant traces of it in all, even the most eccentric and absurd\ndogmas, of different times and different lands,—often indeed in strange\ncompany, curiously mixed up with other things, but still recognisable. It\nis like a plant that germinates under a heap of great stones, but still\nstruggles up to the light, working itself through with many deviations and\nwindings, disfigured, worn out, stunted in its growth,—but yet, to the\nlight.\n\nIn any case Malebranche is right: every natural cause is only an\noccasional cause. It only gives opportunity or occasion for the\nmanifestation of the one indivisible will which is the “in-itself” of all\nthings, and whose graduated objectification is the whole visible world.\nOnly the appearance, the becoming visible, in this place, at this time, is\nbrought about by the cause and is so far dependent on it, but not the\nwhole of the phenomenon, nor its inner nature. This is the will itself, to\nwhich the principle of sufficient reason has not application, and which is\ntherefore groundless. Nothing in the world has a sufficient cause of its\nexistence generally, but only a cause of existence just here and just now.\nThat a stone exhibits now gravity, now rigidity, now electricity, now\nchemical qualities, depends upon causes, upon impressions upon it from\nwithout, and is to be explained from these. But these qualities\nthemselves, and thus the whole inner nature of the stone which consists in\nthem, and therefore manifests itself in all the ways referred to; thus, in\ngeneral, that the stone is such as it is, that it exists generally—all\nthis, I say, has no ground, but is the visible appearance of the\ngroundless will. Every cause is thus an occasional cause. We have found it\nto be so in nature, which is without knowledge, and it is also precisely\nthe same when motives and not causes or stimuli determine the point at\nwhich the phenomena are to appear, that is to say, in the actions of\nanimals and human beings. For in both cases it is one and the same will\nwhich appears; very different in the grades of its manifestation,\nmultiplied in the phenomena of these grades, and, in respect of these,\nsubordinated to the principle of sufficient reason, but in itself free\nfrom all this. Motives do not determine the character of man, but only the\nphenomena of his character, that is, his actions; the outward fashion of\nhis life, not its inner meaning and content. These proceed from the\ncharacter which is the immediate manifestation of the will, and is\ntherefore groundless. That one man is bad and another good, does not\ndepend upon motives or outward influences, such as teaching and preaching,\nand is in this sense quite inexplicable. But whether a bad man shows his\nbadness in petty acts of injustice, cowardly tricks, and low knavery which\nhe practises in the narrow sphere of his circumstances, or whether as a\nconqueror he oppresses nations, throws a world into lamentation, and sheds\nthe blood of millions; this is the outward form of his manifestation, that\nwhich is unessential to it, and depends upon the circumstances in which\nfate has placed him, upon his surroundings, upon external influences, upon\nmotives; but his decision upon these motives can never be explained from\nthem; it proceeds from the will, of which this man is a manifestation. Of\nthis we shall speak in the Fourth Book. The manner in which the character\ndiscloses its qualities is quite analogous to the way in which those of\nevery material body in unconscious nature are disclosed. Water remains\nwater with its intrinsic qualities, whether as a still lake it reflects\nits banks, or leaps in foam from the cliffs, or, artificially confined,\nspouts in a long jet into the air. All that depends upon external causes;\nthe one form is as natural to it as the other, but it will always show the\nsame form in the same circumstances; it is equally ready for any, but in\nevery case true to its character, and at all times revealing this alone.\nSo will every human character under all circumstances reveal itself, but\nthe phenomena which proceed from it will always be in accordance with the\ncircumstances.",

    "page_content": "their phenomena, we have come to see clearly how far an explanation from\ncauses can go, and where it must stop if it is not to degenerate into the\nvain attempt to reduce the content of all phenomena to their mere form, in\nwhich case there would ultimately remain nothing but form, we shall be\nable to settle in general terms what is to be demanded of etiology as a\nwhole. It must seek out the causes of all phenomena in nature, _i.e._, the\ncircumstances under which they invariably appear. Then it must refer the\nmultitude of phenomena which have various forms in various circumstances\nto what is active in every phenomenon, and is presupposed in the\ncause,—original forces of nature. It must correctly distinguish between a\ndifference of the phenomenon which arises from a difference of the force,\nand one which results merely from a difference of the circumstances under\nwhich the force expresses itself; and with equal care it must guard\nagainst taking the expressions of one and the same force under different\ncircumstances for the manifestations of different forces, and conversely\nagainst taking for manifestations of one and the same force what\noriginally belongs to different forces. Now this is the direct work of the\nfaculty of judgment, and that is why so few men are capable of increasing\nour insight in physics, while all are able to enlarge experience.\nIndolence and ignorance make us disposed to appeal too soon to original\nforces. This is exemplified with an exaggeration that savours of irony in\nthe entities and quidities of the schoolmen. Nothing is further from my\ndesire than to favour their resuscitation. We have just as little right to\nappeal to the objectification of will, instead of giving a physical\nexplanation, as we have to appeal to the creative power of God. For\nphysics demands causes, and the will is never a cause. Its whole relation\nto the phenomenon is not in accordance with the principle of sufficient\nreason. But that which in itself is the will exists in another aspect as\nidea; that is to say, is phenomenon. As such, it obeys the laws which\nconstitute the form of the phenomenon. Every movement, for example,\nalthough it is always a manifestation of will, must yet have a cause from\nwhich it is to be explained in relation to a particular time and space;\nthat is, not in general in its inner nature, but as a _particular_\nphenomenon. In the case of the stone, this is a mechanical cause; in that\nof the movement of a man, it is a motive; but in no case can it be\nwanting. On the other hand, the universal common nature of all phenomena\nof one particular kind, that which must be presupposed if the explanation\nfrom causes is to have any sense and meaning, is the general force of\nnature, which, in physics, must remain a _qualitas occulta_, because with\nit the etiological explanation ends and the metaphysical begins. But the\nchain of causes and effects is never broken by an original force to which\nit has been necessary to appeal. It does not run back to such a force as\nif it were its first link, but the nearest link, as well as the remotest,\npresupposes the original force, and could otherwise explain nothing. A\nseries of causes and effects may be the manifestation of the most\ndifferent kinds of forces, whose successive visible appearances are\nconducted through it, as I have illustrated above by the example of a\nmetal machine. But the difference of these original forces, which cannot\nbe referred to each other, by no means breaks the unity of that chain of\ncauses, and the connection between all its links. The etiology and the\nphilosophy of nature never do violence to each other, but go hand in hand,\nregarding the same object from different points of view. Etiology gives an\naccount of the causes which necessarily produce the particular phenomenon\nto be explained. It exhibits, as the foundation of all its explanations,\nthe universal forces which are active in all these causes and effects. It\naccurately defines, enumerates, and distinguishes these forces, and then\nindicates all the different effects in which each force appears, regulated\nby the difference of the circumstances, always in accordance with its own\npeculiar character, which it discloses in obedience to an invariable rule,\ncalled _a law of nature_. When all this has been thoroughly accomplished\nby physics in every particular, it will be complete, and its work will be\ndone. There will then remain no unknown force in unorganised nature, nor\nany effect, which has not been proved to be the manifestation of one of\nthese forces under definite circumstances, in accordance with a law of\nnature. Yet a law of nature remains merely the observed rule according to\nwhich nature invariably proceeds whenever certain definite circumstances\noccur. Therefore a law of nature may be defined as a fact expressed\ngenerally—_un fait généralisé_—and thus a complete enumeration of all the\nlaws of nature would only be a complete register of facts. The\nconsideration of nature as a whole is thus completed in _morphology_,\nwhich enumerates, compares, and arranges all the enduring forms of\norganised nature. Of the causes of the appearance of the individual\ncreature it has little to say, for in all cases this is procreation (the\ntheory of which is a separate matter), and in rare cases the _generatio\næquivoca_. But to this last belongs, strictly speaking, the manner in\nwhich all the lower grades of the objectification of will, that is to say,\nphysical and chemical phenomena, appear as individual, and it is precisely\nthe task of etiology to point out the conditions of this appearance.\nPhilosophy, on the other hand, concerns itself only with the universal, in\nnature as everywhere else. The original forces themselves are here its\nobject, and it recognises in them the different grades of the objectivity\nof will, which is the inner nature, the “in-itself” of this world; and\nwhen it regards the world apart from will, it explains it as merely the\nidea of the subject. But if etiology, instead of preparing the way for\nphilosophy, and supplying its doctrines with practical application by\nmeans of instances, supposes that its aim is rather to deny the existence\nof all original forces, except perhaps _one_, the most general, for\nexample, impenetrability, which it imagines it thoroughly understands, and\nconsequently seeks forcibly to refer all the others to it—it forsakes its\nown province and can only give us error instead of truth. The content of\nnature is supplanted by its form, everything is ascribed to the\ncircumstances which work from without, and nothing to the inner nature of\nthe thing. Now if it were possible to succeed by this method, a problem in\narithmetic would ultimately, as we have already remarked, solve the riddle\nof the universe. But this is the method adopted by those, referred to\nabove, who think that all physiological effects ought to be reduced to\nform and combination, this, perhaps, to electricity, and this again to\nchemism, and chemism to mechanism. The mistake of Descartes, for example,\nand of all the Atomists, was of this last description. They referred the\nmovements of the globe to the impact of a fluid, and the qualities of\nmatter to the connection and form of the atoms, and hence they laboured to\nexplain all the phenomena of nature as merely manifestations of\nimpenetrability and cohesion. Although this has been given up, precisely\nthe same error is committed in our own day by the electrical, chemical,\nand mechanical physiologists, who obstinately attempt to explain the whole\nof life and all the functions of the organism from “form and combination.”\nIn Meckel’s “Archiv für Physiologie” (1820, vol. v. p. 185) we still find\nit stated that the aim of physiological explanation is the reduction of\norganic life to the universal forces with which physics deals. Lamarck\nalso, in his “_Philosophie Zoologique_,” explains life as merely the\neffect of warmth and electricity: _le calorique et la matière électrique\nsuffisent parfaitement pour composer ensemble cette cause essentielle de\nla vie_ (p. 16). According to this, warmth and electricity would be the\n“thing-in-itself,” and the world of animals and plants its phenomenal\nappearance. The absurdity of this opinion becomes glaringly apparent at\nthe 306th and following pages of that work. It is well known that all\nthese opinions, that have been so often refuted, have reappeared quite\nrecently with renewed confidence. If we carefully examine the foundation\nof these views, we shall find that they ultimately involve the\npresupposition that the organism is merely an aggregate of phenomena of\nphysical, chemical, and mechanical forces, which have come together here\nby chance, and produced the organism as a freak of nature without further\nsignificance. The organism of an animal or of a human being would\ntherefore be, if considered philosophically, not the exhibition of a\nspecial Idea, that is, not itself immediate objectivity of the will at a\ndefinite higher grade, but in it would appear only those Ideas which\nobjectify the will in electricity, in chemism, and in mechanism. Thus the\norganism would be as fortuitously constructed by the concurrence of these\nforces as the forms of men and beasts in clouds and stalactites, and would\ntherefore in itself be no more interesting than they are. However, we\nshall see immediately how far the application of physical and chemical\nmodes of explanation to the organism may yet, within certain limits, be\nallowable and useful; for I shall explain that the vital force certainly\navails itself of and uses the forces of unorganised nature; yet these\nforces no more constitute the vital force than a hammer and anvil make a\nblacksmith. Therefore even the most simple example of plant life can never\nbe explained from these forces by any theory of capillary attraction and\nendosmose, much less animal life. The following observations will prepare\nthe way for this somewhat difficult discussion.\n\nIt follows from all that has been said that it is certainly an error on\nthe part of natural science to seek to refer the higher grades of the\nobjectification of will to the lower; for the failure to recognise, or the\ndenial of, original and self-existing forces of nature is just as wrong as\nthe groundless assumption of special forces when what occurs is merely a\npeculiar kind of manifestation of what is already known. Thus Kant rightly\nsays that it would be absurd to hope for a blade of grass from a Newton,\nthat is, from one who reduced the blade of grass to the manifestations of\nphysical and chemical forces, of which it was the chance product, and\ntherefore a mere freak of nature, in which no special Idea appeared,\n_i.e._, the will did not directly reveal itself in it in a higher and\nspecific grade, but just as in the phenomena of unorganised nature and by\nchance in this form. The schoolmen, who certainly would not have allowed\nsuch a doctrine, would rightly have said that it was a complete denial of\nthe _forma substantialis_, and a degradation of it to the _forma\naccidentalis_. For the _forma substantialis_ of Aristotle denotes exactly\nwhat I call the grade of the objectification of will in a thing. On the\nother hand, it is not to be overlooked that in all Ideas, that is, in all\nforces of unorganised, and all forms of organised nature, it is _one and\nthe same_ will that reveals itself, that is to say, which enters the form\nof the idea and passes into _objectivity_. Its unity must therefore be\nalso recognisable through an inner relationship between all its phenomena.\nNow this reveals itself in the higher grades of the objectification of\nwill, where the whole phenomenon is more distinct, thus in the vegetable\nand animal kingdoms, through the universally prevailing analogy of all\nforms, the fundamental type which recurs in all phenomena. This has,\ntherefore, become the guiding principle of the admirable zoological system\nwhich was originated by the French in this century, and it is most\ncompletely established in comparative anatomy as _l’unité de plan_,\n_l’uniformité de l’élément anatomique_. To discover this fundamental type\nhas been the chief concern, or at any rate the praiseworthy endeavour, of\nthe natural philosophers of the school of Schelling, who have in this\nrespect considerable merit, although in many cases their hunt after\nanalogies in nature degenerated into mere conceits. They have, however,\nrightly shown that that general relationship and family likeness exists\nalso in the Ideas of unorganised nature; for example, between electricity\nand magnetism, the identity of which was afterwards established; between\nchemical attraction and gravitation, and so forth. They specially called\nattention to the fact that _polarity_, that is, the sundering of a force\ninto two qualitatively different and opposed activities striving after\nreunion, which also shows itself for the most part in space as a\ndispersion in opposite directions, is a fundamental type of almost all the\nphenomena of nature, from the magnet and the crystal to man himself. Yet\nthis knowledge has been current in China from the earliest times, in the\ndoctrine of opposition of Yin and Yang. Indeed, since all things in the\nworld are the objectification of one and the same will, and therefore in\ntheir inner nature identical, it must not only be the case that there is\nthat unmistakable analogy between them, and that in every phenomenon the\ntrace, intimation, and plan of the higher phenomenon that lies next to it\nin point of development shows itself, but also because all these forms\nbelong to the world as _idea_, it is indeed conceivable that even in the\nmost universal forms of the idea, in that peculiar framework of the\nphenomenal world space and time, it may be possible to discern and\nestablish the fundamental type, intimation, and plan of what fills the\nforms. It seems to have been a dim notion of this that was the origin of\nthe Cabala and all the mathematical philosophy of the Pythagoreans, and\nalso of the Chinese in Y-king. In the school of Schelling also, to which\nwe have already referred, we find, among their efforts to bring to light\nthe similarity among the phenomena of nature, several attempts (though\nrather unfortunate ones) to deduce laws of nature from the laws of pure\nspace and time. However, one can never tell to what extent a man of genius\nwill realise both endeavours.\n\nNow, although the difference between phenomenon and thing-in-itself is\nnever lost sight of, and therefore the identity of the will which\nobjectifies itself in all Ideas can never (because it has different grades\nof its objectification) be distorted to mean identity of the particular\nIdeas themselves in which it appears, so that, for example, chemical or\nelectrical attraction can never be reduced to the attraction of\ngravitation, although this inner analogy is known, and the former may be\nregarded as, so to speak, higher powers of the latter, just as little does\nthe similarity of the construction of all animals warrant us in mixing and\nidentifying the species and explaining the more developed as mere\nvariations of the less developed; and although, finally, the physiological\nfunctions are never to be reduced to chemical or physical processes, yet,\nin justification of this procedure, within certain limits, we may accept\nthe following observations as highly probable.\n\nIf several of the phenomena of will in the lower grades of its\nobjectification—that is, in unorganised nature—come into conflict because\neach of them, under the guidance of causality, seeks to possess a given\nportion of matter, there arises from the conflict the phenomenon of a\nhigher Idea which prevails over all the less developed phenomena\npreviously there, yet in such a way that it allows the essence of these to\ncontinue to exist in a subordinate manner, in that it takes up into itself\nfrom them something which is analogous to them. This process is only\nintelligible from the identity of the will which manifests itself in all\nthe Ideas, and which is always striving after higher objectification. We\nthus see, for example, in the hardening of the bones, an unmistakable\nanalogy to crystallisation, as the force which originally had possession\nof the chalk, although ossification is never to be reduced to\ncrystallisation. The analogy shows itself in a weaker degree in the flesh\nbecoming firm. The combination of humours in the animal body and secretion\nare also analogous to chemical combination and separation. Indeed, the\nlaws of chemistry are still strongly operative in this case, but\nsubordinated, very much modified, and mastered by a higher Idea; therefore\nmere chemical forces outside the organism will never afford us such\nhumours; but\n\n    “Encheiresin naturæ nennt es die Chemie,\n    Spottet ihrer selbst und weiss nicht wie.”\n\nThe more developed Idea resulting from this victory over several lower\nIdeas or objectifications of will, gains an entirely new character by\ntaking up into itself from every Idea over which it has prevailed a\nstrengthened analogy. The will objectifies itself in a new, more distinct\nway. It originally appears in _generatio æquivoca_; afterwards in\nassimilation to the given germ, organic moisture, plant, animal, man. Thus\nfrom the strife of lower phenomena the higher arise, swallowing them all\nup, but yet realising in the higher grade the tendency of all the lower.\nHere, then, already the law applies—_Serpens nisi serpentem comederit non\nfit draco._\n\nI wish it had been possible for me to dispel by clearness of explanation\nthe obscurity which clings to the subject of these thoughts; but I see\nvery well that the reader’s own consideration of the matter must\nmaterially aid me if I am not to remain uncomprehended or misunderstood.\nAccording to the view I have expressed, the traces of chemical and\nphysical modes of operation will indeed be found in the organism, but it\ncan never be explained from them; because it is by no means a phenomenon\neven accidentally brought about through the united actions of such forces,\nbut a higher Idea which has overcome these lower ideas by _subduing\nassimilation_; for the _one_ will which objectifies itself in all Ideas\nalways seeks the highest possible objectification, and has therefore in\nthis case given up the lower grades of its manifestation after a conflict,\nin order to appear in a higher grade, and one so much the more powerful.\nNo victory without conflict: since the higher Idea or objectification of\nwill can only appear through the conquest of the lower, it endures the\nopposition of these lower Ideas, which, although brought into subjection,\nstill constantly strive to obtain an independent and complete expression\nof their being. The magnet that has attracted a piece of iron carries on a\nperpetual conflict with gravitation, which, as the lower objectification\nof will, has a prior right to the matter of the iron; and in this constant\nbattle the magnet indeed grows stronger, for the opposition excites it, as\nit were, to greater effort. In the same way every manifestation of the\nwill, including that which expresses itself in the human organism, wages a\nconstant war against the many physical and chemical forces which, as lower\nIdeas, have a prior right to that matter. Thus the arm falls which for a\nwhile, overcoming gravity, we have held stretched out; thus the pleasing\nsensation of health, which proclaims the victory of the Idea of the\nself-conscious organism over the physical and chemical laws, which\noriginally governed the humours of the body, is so often interrupted, and\nis indeed always accompanied by greater or less discomfort, which arises\nfrom the resistance of these forces, and on account of which the\nvegetative part of our life is constantly attended by slight pain. Thus\nalso digestion weakens all the animal functions, because it requires the\nwhole vital force to overcome the chemical forces of nature by\nassimilation. Hence also in general the burden of physical life, the\nnecessity of sleep, and, finally, of death; for at last these subdued\nforces of nature, assisted by circumstances, win back from the organism,\nwearied even by the constant victory, the matter it took from them, and\nattain to an unimpeded expression of their being. We may therefore say\nthat every organism expresses the Idea of which it is the image, only\nafter we have subtracted the part of its force which is expended in\nsubduing the lower Ideas that strive with it for matter. This seems to\nhave been running in the mind of Jacob Böhm when he says somewhere that\nall the bodies of men and animals, and even all plants, are really half\ndead. According as the subjection in the organism of these forces of\nnature, which express the lower grades of the objectification of will, is\nmore or less successful, the more or the less completely does it attain to\nthe expression of its Idea; that is to say, the nearer it is to the\n_ideal_ or the further from it—the _ideal_ of beauty in its species.\n\nThus everywhere in nature we see strife, conflict, and alternation of\nvictory, and in it we shall come to recognise more distinctly that\nvariance with itself which is essential to the will. Every grade of the\nobjectification of will fights for the matter, the space, and the time of\nthe others. The permanent matter must constantly change its form; for\nunder the guidance of causality, mechanical, physical, chemical, and\norganic phenomena, eagerly striving to appear, wrest the matter from each\nother, for each desires to reveal its own Idea. This strife may be\nfollowed through the whole of nature; indeed nature exists only through\nit: ει γαρ μη ην το νεικος εν τοις πραγμασιν, ἑν αν ην ἁπαντα, ὡς φησιν\nΕμπεδοκλης; (nam si non inesset in rebus contentio, unum omnia essent, ut\nait Empedocles. Aris. Metaph., B. 5). Yet this strife itself is only the\nrevelation of that variance with itself which is essential to the will.\nThis universal conflict becomes most distinctly visible in the animal\nkingdom. For animals have the whole of the vegetable kingdom for their\nfood, and even within the animal kingdom every beast is the prey and the\nfood of another; that is, the matter in which its Idea expresses itself\nmust yield itself to the expression of another Idea, for each animal can\nonly maintain its existence by the constant destruction of some other.\nThus the will to live everywhere preys upon itself, and in different forms\nis its own nourishment, till finally the human race, because it subdues\nall the others, regards nature as a manufactory for its use. Yet even the\nhuman race, as we shall see in the Fourth Book, reveals in itself with\nmost terrible distinctness this conflict, this variance with itself of the\nwill, and we find _homo homini lupus_. Meanwhile we can recognise this\nstrife, this subjugation, just as well in the lower grades of the\nobjectification of will. Many insects (especially ichneumon-flies) lay\ntheir eggs on the skin, and even in the body of the larvæ of other\ninsects, whose slow destruction is the first work of the newly hatched\nbrood. The young hydra, which grows like a bud out of the old one, and\nafterwards separates itself from it, fights while it is still joined to\nthe old one for the prey that offers itself, so that the one snatches it\nout of the mouth of the other (Trembley, Polypod., ii. p. 110, and iii. p.\n165). But the bulldog-ant of Australia affords us the most extraordinary\nexample of this kind; for if it is cut in two, a battle begins between the\nhead and the tail. The head seizes the tail with its teeth, and the tail\ndefends itself bravely by stinging the head: the battle may last for half\nan hour, until they die or are dragged away by other ants. This contest\ntakes place every time the experiment is tried. (From a letter by Howitt\nin the W. Journal, reprinted in Galignani’s Messenger, 17th November\n1855.) On the banks of the Missouri one sometimes sees a mighty oak the\nstem and branches of which are so encircled, fettered, and interlaced by a\ngigantic wild vine, that it withers as if choked. The same thing shows\nitself in the lowest grades; for example, when water and carbon are\nchanged into vegetable sap, or vegetables or bread into blood by organic\nassimilation; and so also in every case in which animal secretion takes\nplace, along with the restriction of chemical forces to a subordinate mode\nof activity. This also occurs in unorganised nature, when, for example,\ncrystals in process of formation meet, cross, and mutually disturb each\nother to such an extent that they are unable to assume the pure\ncrystalline form, so that almost every cluster of crystals is an image of\nsuch a conflict of will at this low grade of its objectification; or\nagain, when a magnet forces its magnetism upon iron, in order to express\nits Idea in it; or when galvanism overcomes chemical affinity, decomposes\nthe closest combinations, and so entirely suspends the laws of chemistry\nthat the acid of a decomposed salt at the negative pole must pass to the\npositive pole without combining with the alkalies through which it goes on\nits way, or turning red the litmus paper that touches it. On a large scale\nit shows itself in the relation between the central body and the planet,\nfor although the planet is in absolute dependence, yet it always resists,\njust like the chemical forces in the organism; hence arises the constant\ntension between centripetal and centrifugal force, which keeps the globe\nin motion, and is itself an example of that universal essential conflict\nof the manifestation of will which we are considering. For as every body\nmust be regarded as the manifestation of a will, and as will necessarily\nexpresses itself as a struggle, the original condition of every world that\nis formed into a globe cannot be rest, but motion, a striving forward in\nboundless space without rest and without end. Neither the law of inertia\nnor that of causality is opposed to this: for as, according to the former,\nmatter as such is alike indifferent to rest and motion, its original\ncondition may just as well be the one as the other, therefore if we first\nfind it in motion, we have just as little right to assume that this was\npreceded by a condition of rest, and to inquire into the cause of the\norigin of the motion, as, conversely, if we found it at rest, we would\nhave to assume a previous motion and inquire into the cause of its\nsuspension. It is, therefore, not needful to seek for a first impulse for\ncentrifugal force, for, according to the hypothesis of Kant and Laplace,\nit is, in the case of the planets, the residue of the original rotation of\nthe central body, from which the planets have separated themselves as it\ncontracted. But to this central body itself motion is essential; it always\ncontinues its rotation, and at the same time rushes forward in endless\nspace, or perhaps circulates round a greater central body invisible to us.\nThis view entirely agrees with the conjecture of astronomers that there is\na central sun, and also with the observed advance of our whole solar\nsystem, and perhaps of the whole stellar system to which our sun belongs.\nFrom this we are finally led to assume a general advance of fixed stars,\ntogether with the central sun, and this certainly loses all meaning in\nboundless space (for motion in absolute space cannot be distinguished from\nrest), and becomes, as is already the case from its striving and aimless\nflight, an expression of that nothingness, that failure of all aim, which,\nat the close of this book, we shall be obliged to recognise in the\nstriving of will in all its phenomena. Thus boundless space and endless\ntime must be the most universal and essential forms of the collective\nphenomena of will, which exist for the expression of its whole being.\nLastly, we can recognise that conflict which we are considering of all\nphenomena of will against each other in simple matter regarded as such;\nfor the real characteristic of matter is correctly expressed by Kant as\nrepulsive and attractive force; so that even crude matter has its\nexistence only in the strife of conflicting forces. If we abstract from\nall chemical differences in matter, or go so far back in the chain of\ncauses and effects that as yet there is no chemical difference, there\nremains mere matter,—the world rounded to a globe, whose life, _i.e._,\nobjectification of will, is now constituted by the conflict between\nattractive and repulsive forces, the former as gravitation pressing from\nall sides towards the centre, the latter as impenetrability always\nopposing the former either as rigidity or elasticity; and this constant\npressure and resistance may be regarded as the objectivity of will in its\nvery lowest grade, and even there it expresses its character.\n\nWe should see the will express itself here in the lowest grade as blind\nstriving, an obscure, inarticulate impulse, far from susceptible of being\ndirectly known. It is the simplest and the weakest mode of its\nobjectification. But it appears as this blind and unconscious striving in\nthe whole of unorganised nature, in all those original forces of which it\nis the work of physics and chemistry to discover and to study the laws,\nand each of which manifests itself to us in millions of phenomena which\nare exactly similar and regular, and show no trace of individual\ncharacter, but are mere multiplicity through space and time, _i.e._,\nthrough the _principium individuationis_, as a picture is multiplied\nthrough the facets of a glass.\n\nFrom grade to grade objectifying itself more distinctly, yet still\ncompletely without consciousness as an obscure striving force, the will\nacts in the vegetable kingdom also, in which the bond of its phenomena\nconsists no longer properly of causes, but of stimuli; and, finally, also\nin the vegetative part of the animal phenomenon, in the production and\nmaturing of the animal, and in sustaining its inner economy, in which the\nmanifestation of will is still always necessarily determined by stimuli.\nThe ever-ascending grades of the objectification of will bring us at last\nto the point at which the individual that expresses the Idea could no\nlonger receive food for its assimilation through mere movement following\nupon stimuli. For such a stimulus must be waited for, but the food has now\ncome to be of a more special and definite kind, and with the\never-increasing multiplicity of the individual phenomena, the crowd and\nconfusion has become so great that they interfere with each other, and the\nchance of the individual that is moved merely by stimuli and must wait for\nits food would be too unfavourable. From the point, therefore, at which\nthe animal has delivered itself from the egg or the womb in which it\nvegetated without consciousness, its food must be sought out and selected.\nFor this purpose movement following upon motives, and therefore\nconsciousness, becomes necessary, and consequently it appears as an agent,\nμηχανη, called in at this stage of the objectification of will for the\nconservation of the individual and the propagation of the species. It\nappears represented by the brain or a large ganglion, just as every other\neffort or determination of the will which objectifies itself is\nrepresented by an organ, that is to say, manifests itself for the idea as\nan organ.(36) But with this means of assistance, this μηχανη, the _world\nas idea_ comes into existence at a stroke, with all its forms, object and\nsubject, time, space, multiplicity, and causality. The world now shows its\nsecond side. Till now _mere will_, it becomes also _idea_, object of the\nknowing subject. The will, which up to this point followed its tendency in\nthe dark with unerring certainty, has at this grade kindled for itself a\nlight as a means which became necessary for getting rid of the\ndisadvantage which arose from the throng and the complicated nature of its\nmanifestations, and which would have accrued precisely to the most perfect\nof them. The hitherto infallible certainty and regularity with which it\nworked in unorganised and merely vegetative nature, rested upon the fact\nthat it alone was active in its original nature, as blind impulse, will,\nwithout assistance, and also without interruption, from a second and\nentirely different world, the world as idea, which is indeed only the\nimage of its own inner being, but is yet of quite another nature, and now\nencroaches on the connected whole of its phenomena. Hence its infallible\ncertainty comes to an end. Animals are already exposed to illusion, to\ndeception. They have, however, merely ideas of perception, no conceptions,\nno reflection, and they are therefore bound to the present; they cannot\nhave regard for the future. It seems as if this knowledge without reason\nwas not in all cases sufficient for its end, and at times required, as it\nwere, some assistance. For the very remarkable phenomenon presents itself,\nthat the blind working of the will and the activity enlightened by\nknowledge encroach in a most astonishing manner upon each other’s spheres\nin two kinds of phenomena. In the one case we find in the very midst of\nthose actions of animals which are guided by perceptive knowledge and its\nmotives one kind of action which is accomplished apart from these, and\nthus through the necessity of the blindly acting will. I refer to those\nmechanical instincts which are guided by no motive or knowledge, and which\nyet have the appearance of performing their work from abstract rational\nmotives. The other case, which is opposed to this, is that in which, on\nthe contrary, the light of knowledge penetrates into the workshop of the\nblindly active will, and illuminates the vegetative functions of the human\norganism. I mean clairvoyance. Finally, when the will has attained to the\nhighest grade of its objectification, that knowledge of the understanding\ngiven to brutes to which the senses supply the data, out of which there\narises mere perception confined to what is immediately present, does not\nsuffice. That complicated, many-sided, imaginative being, man, with his\nmany needs, and exposed as he is to innumerable dangers, must, in order to\nexist, be lighted by a double knowledge; a higher power, as it were, of\nperceptive knowledge must be given him, and also reason, as the faculty of\nframing abstract conceptions. With this there has appeared reflection,\nsurveying the future and the past, and, as a consequence, deliberation,\ncare, the power of premeditated action independent of the present, and\nfinally, the full and distinct consciousness of one’s own deliberate\nvolition as such. Now if with mere knowledge of perception there arose the\npossibility of illusion and deception, by which the previous infallibility\nof the blind striving of will was done away with, so that mechanical and\nother instincts, as expressions of unconscious will, had to lend their\nhelp in the midst of those that were conscious, with the entrance of\nreason that certainty and infallibility of the expressions of will (which\nat the other extreme in unorganised nature appeared as strict conformity\nto law) is almost entirely lost; instinct disappears altogether;\ndeliberation, which is supposed to take the place of everything else,\nbegets (as was shown in the First Book) irresolution and uncertainty; then\nerror becomes possible, and in many cases obstructs the adequate\nobjectification of the will in action. For although in the character the\nwill has already taken its definite and unchangeable bent or direction, in\naccordance with which volition, when occasioned by the presence of a\nmotive, invariably takes place, yet error can falsify its expressions, for\nit introduces illusive motives that take the place of the real ones which\nthey resemble;(37) as, for example, when superstition forces on a man\nimaginary motives which impel him to a course of action directly opposed\nto the way in which the will would otherwise express itself in the given\ncircumstances. Agamemnon slays his daughter; a miser dispenses alms, out\nof pure egotism, in the hope that he will some day receive an\nhundred-fold; and so on.\n\nThus knowledge generally, rational as well as merely sensuous, proceeds\noriginally from the will itself, belongs to the inner being of the higher\ngrades of its objectification as a mere μηχανη, a means of supporting the\nindividual and the species, just like any organ of the body. Originally\ndestined for the service of the will for the accomplishment of its aims,\nit remains almost throughout entirely subjected to its service: it is so\nin all brutes and in almost all men. Yet we shall see in the Third Book\nhow in certain individual men knowledge can deliver itself from this\nbondage, throw off its yoke, and, free from all the aims of will, exist\npurely for itself, simply as a clear mirror of the world, which is the\nsource of art. Finally, in the Fourth Book, we shall see how, if this kind\nof knowledge reacts on the will, it can bring about self-surrender,\n_i.e._, resignation, which is the final goal, and indeed the inmost nature\nof all virtue and holiness, and is deliverance from the world.",

    "page_content": "phenomena in which the will objectifies itself, and we have seen their\nendless and implacable strife with each other. Yet, according to the whole\ndiscussion up to this point, the will itself, as thing-in-itself, is by no\nmeans included in that multiplicity and change. The diversity of the\n(Platonic) Ideas, _i.e._, grades of objectification, the multitude of\nindividuals in which each of these expresses itself, the struggle of forms\nfor matter,—all this does not concern it, but is only the manner of its\nobjectification, and only through this has an indirect relation to it, by\nvirtue of which it belongs to the expression of the nature of will for the\nidea. As the magic-lantern shows many different pictures, which are all\nmade visible by one and the same light, so in all the multifarious\nphenomena which fill the world together or throng after each other as\nevents, only _one will_ manifests itself, of which everything is the\nvisibility, the objectivity, and which remains unmoved in the midst of\nthis change; it alone is thing-in-itself; all objects are manifestations,\nor, to speak the language of Kant, phenomena. Although in man, as\n(Platonic) Idea, the will finds its clearest and fullest objectification,\nyet man alone could not express its being. In order to manifest the full\nsignificance of the will, the Idea of man would need to appear, not alone\nand sundered from everything else, but accompanied by the whole series of\ngrades, down through all the forms of animals, through the vegetable\nkingdom to unorganised nature. All these supplement each other in the\ncomplete objectification of will; they are as much presupposed by the Idea\nof man as the blossoms of a tree presuppose leaves, branches, stem, and\nroot; they form a pyramid, of which man is the apex. If fond of similes,\none might also say that their manifestations accompany that of man as\nnecessarily as the full daylight is accompanied by all the gradations of\ntwilight, through which, little by little, it loses itself in darkness; or\none might call them the echo of man, and say: Animal and plant are the\ndescending fifth and third of man, the inorganic kingdom is the lower\noctave. The full truth of this last comparison will only become clear to\nus when, in the following book, we attempt to fathom the deep significance\nof music, and see how a connected, progressive melody, made up of high,\nquick notes, may be regarded as in some sense expressing the life and\nefforts of man connected by reflection, while the unconnected complemental\nnotes and the slow bass, which make up the harmony necessary to perfect\nthe music, represent the rest of the animal kingdom and the whole of\nnature that is without knowledge. But of this in its own place, where it\nwill not sound so paradoxical. We find, however, that the _inner\nnecessity_ of the gradation of its manifestations, which is inseparable\nfrom the adequate objectification of the will, is expressed by an _outer\nnecessity_ in the whole of these manifestations themselves, by reason of\nwhich man has need of the beasts for his support, the beasts in their\ngrades have need of each other as well as of plants, which in their turn\nrequire the ground, water, chemical elements and their combinations, the\nplanet, the sun, rotation and motion round the sun, the curve of the\nellipse, &c., &c. At bottom this results from the fact that the will must\nlive on itself, for there exists nothing beside it, and it is a hungry\nwill. Hence arise eager pursuit, anxiety, and suffering.\n\nIt is only the knowledge of the unity of will as thing-in-itself, in the\nendless diversity and multiplicity of the phenomena, that can afford us\nthe true explanation of that wonderful, unmistakable analogy of all the\nproductions of nature, that family likeness on account of which we may\nregard them as variations on the same ungiven theme. So in like measure,\nthrough the distinct and thoroughly comprehended knowledge of that\nharmony, that essential connection of all the parts of the world, that\nnecessity of their gradation which we have just been considering, we shall\nobtain a true and sufficient insight into the inner nature and meaning of\nthe undeniable _teleology_ of all organised productions of nature, which,\nindeed, we presupposed _a priori_, when considering and investigating\nthem.\n\nThis _teleology_ is of a twofold description; sometimes an _inner\nteleology_, that is, an agreement of all the parts of a particular\norganism, so ordered that the sustenance of the individual and the species\nresults from it, and therefore presents itself as the end of that\ndisposition or arrangement. Sometimes, however, there is an _outward\nteleology_, a relation of unorganised to organised nature in general, or\nof particular parts of organised nature to each other, which makes the\nmaintenance of the whole of organised nature, or of the particular animal\nspecies, possible, and therefore presents itself to our judgment as the\nmeans to this end.\n\n_Inner teleology_ is connected with the scheme of our work in the\nfollowing way. If, in accordance with what has been said, all variations\nof form in nature, and all multiplicity of individuals, belong not to the\nwill itself, but merely to its objectivity and the form of this\nobjectivity, it necessarily follows that the will is indivisible and is\npresent as a whole in every manifestation, although the grades of its\nobjectification, the (Platonic) Ideas, are very different from each other.\nWe may, for the sake of simplicity, regard these different Ideas as in\nthemselves individual and simple acts of the will, in which it expresses\nits nature more or less. Individuals, however, are again manifestations of\nthe Ideas, thus of these acts, in time, space, and multiplicity. Now, in\nthe lowest grades of objectivity, such an act (or an Idea) retains its\nunity in the manifestation; while, in order to appear in higher grades, it\nrequires a whole series of conditions and developments in time, which only\ncollectively express its nature completely. Thus, for example the Idea\nthat reveals itself in any general force of nature has always one single\nexpression, although it presents itself differently according to the\nexternal relations that are present: otherwise its identity could not be\nproved, for this is done by abstracting the diversity that arises merely\nfrom external relations. In the same way the crystal has only _one_\nmanifestation of life, crystallisation, which afterwards has its fully\nadequate and exhaustive expression in the rigid form, the corpse of that\nmomentary life. The plant, however, does not express the Idea, whose\nphenomenon it is, at once and through a single manifestation, but in a\nsuccession of developments of its organs in time. The animal not only\ndevelops its organism in the same manner, in a succession of forms which\nare often very different (metamorphosis), but this form itself, although\nit is already objectivity of will at this grade, does not attain to a full\nexpression of its Idea. This expression must be completed through the\nactions of the animal, in which its empirical character, common to the\nwhole species, manifests itself, and only then does it become the full\nrevelation of the Idea, a revelation which presupposes the particular\norganism as its first condition. In the case of man, the empirical\ncharacter is peculiar to every individual (indeed, as we shall see in the\nFourth Book, even to the extent of supplanting entirely the character of\nthe species, through the self-surrender of the whole will). That which is\nknown as the empirical character, through the necessary development in\ntime, and the division into particular actions that is conditioned by it,\nis, when we abstract from this temporal form of the manifestation the\n_intelligible character_, according to the expression of Kant, who shows\nhis undying merit especially in establishing this distinction and\nexplaining the relation between freedom and necessity, _i.e._, between the\nwill as thing-in-itself and its manifestations in time.(38) Thus the\nintelligible character coincides with the Idea, or, more accurately, with\nthe original act of will which reveals itself in it. So far then, not only\nthe empirical character of every man, but also that of every species of\nanimal and plant, and even of every original force of unorganised nature,\nis to be regarded as the manifestation of an intelligible character, that\nis, of a timeless, indivisible act of will. I should like here to draw\nattention in passing to the naïveté with which every plant expresses and\nlays open its whole character in its mere form, reveals its whole being\nand will. This is why the physiognomy of plants is so interesting; while\nin order to know an animal in its Idea, it is necessary to observe the\ncourse of its action. As for man, he must be fully investigated and\ntested, for reason makes him capable of a high degree of dissimulation.\nThe beast is as much more naïve than the man as the plant is more naïve\nthan the beast. In the beast we see the will to live more naked, as it\nwere, than in the man, in whom it is clothed with so much knowledge, and\nis, moreover, so veiled through the capacity for dissimulation, that it is\nalmost only by chance, and here and there, that its true nature becomes\napparent. In the plant it shows itself quite naked, but also much weaker,\nas mere blind striving for existence without end or aim. For the plant\nreveals its whole being at the first glance, and with complete innocence,\nwhich does not suffer from the fact that it carries its organs of\ngeneration exposed to view on its upper surface, though in all animals\nthey have been assigned to the most hidden part. This innocence of the\nplant results from its complete want of knowledge. Guilt does not lie in\nwilling, but in willing with knowledge. Every plant speaks to us first of\nall of its home, of the climate, and the nature of the ground in which it\nhas grown. Therefore, even those who have had little practice easily tell\nwhether an exotic plant belongs to the tropical or the temperate zone, and\nwhether it grows in water, in marshes, on mountain, or on moorland.\nBesides this, however, every plant expresses the special will of its\nspecies, and says something that cannot be uttered in any other tongue.\nBut we must now apply what has been said to the teleological consideration\nof the organism, so far as it concerns its inner design. If in unorganised\nnature the Idea, which is everywhere to be regarded as a single act of\nwill, reveals itself also in a single manifestation which is always the\nsame, and thus one may say that here the empirical character directly\npartakes of the unity of the intelligible, coincides, as it were, with it,\nso that no inner design can show itself here; if, on the contrary, all\norganisms express their Ideas through a series of successive developments,\nconditioned by a multiplicity of co-existing parts, and thus only the sum\nof the manifestations of the empirical character collectively constitute\nthe expression of the intelligible character; this necessary co-existence\nof the parts and succession of the stages of development does not destroy\nthe unity of the appearing Idea, the act of will which expresses itself;\nnay, rather this unity finds its expression in the necessary relation and\nconnection of the parts and stages of development with each other, in\naccordance with the law of causality. Since it is the will which is one,\nindivisible, and therefore entirely in harmony with itself, that reveals\nitself in the whole Idea as in act, its manifestation, although broken up\ninto a number of different parts and conditions, must yet show this unity\nagain in the thorough agreement of all of these. This is effected by a\nnecessary relation and dependence of all the parts upon each other, by\nmeans of which the unity of the Idea is re-established in the\nmanifestation. In accordance with this, we now recognise these different\nparts and functions of the organism as related to each other reciprocally\nas means and end, but the organism itself as the final end of all.\nConsequently, neither the breaking up of the Idea, which in itself is\nsimple, into the multiplicity of the parts and conditions of the organism,\non the one hand, nor, on the other hand, the re-establishment of its unity\nthrough the necessary connection of the parts and functions which arises\nfrom the fact that they are the cause and effect, the means and end, of\neach other, is peculiar and essential to the appearing will as such, to\nthe thing-in-itself, but only to its manifestation in space, time, and\ncausality (mere modes of the principle of sufficient reason, the form of\nthe phenomenon). They belong to the world as idea, not to the world as\nwill; they belong to the way in which the will becomes object, _i.e._,\nidea at this grade of its objectivity. Every one who has grasped the\nmeaning of this discussion—a discussion which is perhaps somewhat\ndifficult—will now fully understand the doctrine of Kant, which follows\nfrom it, that both the design of organised and the conformity to law of\nunorganised nature are only introduced by our understanding, and therefore\nboth belong only to the phenomenon, not to the thing-in-itself. The\nsurprise, which was referred to above, at the infallible constancy of the\nconformity to law of unorganised nature, is essentially the same as the\nsurprise that is excited by design in organised nature; for in both cases\nwhat we wonder at is only the sight of the original unity of the Idea,\nwhich, for the phenomenon, has assumed the form of multiplicity and\ndiversity.(39)\n\nAs regards the second kind of teleology, according to the division made\nabove, the _outer_ design, which shows itself, not in the inner economy of\nthe organisms, but in the support and assistance they receive from\nwithout, both from unorganised nature and from each other; its general\nexplanation is to be found in the exposition we have just given. For the\nwhole world, with all its phenomena, is the objectivity of the one\nindivisible will, the Idea, which is related to all other Ideas as harmony\nis related to the single voice. Therefore that unity of the will must show\nitself also in the agreement of all its manifestations. But we can very\nmuch increase the clearness of this insight if we go somewhat more closely\ninto the manifestations of that outer teleology and agreement of the\ndifferent parts of nature with each other, an inquiry which will also\nthrow some light on the foregoing exposition. We shall best attain this\nend by considering the following analogy.\n\nThe character of each individual man, so far as it is thoroughly\nindividual, and not entirely included in that of the species, may be\nregarded as a special Idea, corresponding to a special act of the\nobjectification of will. This act itself would then be his intelligible\ncharacter, and his empirical character would be the manifestation of it.\nThe empirical character is entirely determined through the intelligible,\nwhich is without ground, _i.e._, as thing-in-itself is not subordinated to\nthe principle of sufficient reason (the form of the phenomenon). The\nempirical character must in the course of life afford us the express image\nof the intelligible, and can only become what the nature of the latter\ndemands. But this property extends only to the essential, not to the\nunessential in the course of life to which it applies. To this unessential\nbelong the detailed events and actions which are the material in which the\nempirical character shows itself. These are determined by outward\ncircumstances, which present the motives upon which the character reacts\naccording to its nature; and as they may be very different, the outward\nform of the manifestation of the empirical character, that is, the\ndefinite actual or historical form of the course of life, will have to\naccommodate itself to their influence. Now this form may be very\ndifferent, although what is essential to the manifestation, its content,\nremains the same. Thus, for example it is immaterial whether a man plays\nfor nuts or for crowns; but whether a man cheats or plays fairly, that is\nthe real matter; the latter is determined by the intelligible character,\nthe former by outward circumstances. As the same theme may be expressed in\na hundred different variations, so the same character may be expressed in\na hundred very different lives. But various as the outward influence may\nbe, the empirical character which expresses itself in the course of life\nmust yet, whatever form it takes, accurately objectify the intelligible\ncharacter, for the latter adapts its objectification to the given material\nof actual circumstances. We have now to assume something analogous to the\ninfluence of outward circumstances upon the life that is determined in\nessential matters by the character, if we desire to understand how the\nwill, in the original act of its objectification, determines the various\nIdeas in which it objectifies itself, that is, the different forms of\nnatural existence of every kind, among which it distributes its\nobjectification, and which must therefore necessarily have a relation to\neach other in the manifestation. We must assume that between all these\nmanifestations of the _one_ will there existed a universal and reciprocal\nadaptation and accommodation of themselves to each other, by which,\nhowever, as we shall soon see more clearly, all time-determination is to\nbe excluded, for the Idea lies outside time. In accordance with this,\nevery manifestation must have adapted itself to the surroundings into\nwhich it entered, and these again must have adapted themselves to it,\nalthough it occupied a much later position in time; and we see this\n_consensus naturæ_ everywhere. Every plant is therefore adapted to its\nsoil and climate, every animal to its element and the prey that will be\nits food, and is also in some way protected, to a certain extent, against\nits natural enemy: the eye is adapted to the light and its refrangibility,\nthe lungs and the blood to the air, the air-bladder of fish to water, the\neye of the seal to the change of the medium in which it must see, the\nwater-pouch in the stomach of the camel to the drought of the African\ndeserts, the sail of the nautilus to the wind that is to drive its little\nbark, and so on down to the most special and astonishing outward\nadaptations.(40) We must abstract however here from all temporal\nrelations, for these can only concern the manifestation of the Idea, not\nthe Idea itself. Accordingly this kind of explanation must also be used\nretrospectively, and we must not merely admit that every species\naccommodated itself to the given environment, but also that this\nenvironment itself, which preceded it in time, had just as much regard for\nthe being that would some time come into it. For it is one and the same\nwill that objectifies itself in the whole world; it knows no time, for\nthis form of the principle of sufficient reason does not belong to it, nor\nto its original objectivity, the Ideas, but only to the way in which these\nare known by the individuals who themselves are transitory, _i.e._, to the\nmanifestation of the Ideas. Thus, time has no significance for our present\nexamination of the manner in which the objectification of the will\ndistributes itself among the Ideas, and the Ideas whose _manifestations_\nentered into the course of time earlier, according to the law of\ncausality, to which as phenomena they are subject, have no advantage over\nthose whose manifestation entered later; nay rather, these last are the\ncompletest objectifications of the will, to which the earlier\nmanifestations must adapt themselves just as much as they must adapt\nthemselves to the earlier. Thus the course of the planets, the tendency to\nthe ellipse, the rotation of the earth, the division of land and sea, the\natmosphere, light, warmth, and all such phenomena, which are in nature\nwhat bass is in harmony, adapted themselves in anticipation of the coming\nspecies of living creatures of which they were to become the supporter and\nsustainer. In the same way the ground adapted itself to the nutrition of\nplants, plants adapted themselves to the nutrition of animals, animals to\nthat of other animals, and conversely they all adapted themselves to the\nnutrition of the ground. All the parts of nature correspond to each other,\nfor it is _one_ will that appears in them all, but the course of time is\nquite foreign to its original and only _adequate objectification_ (this\nexpression will be explained in the following book), the Ideas. Even now,\nwhen the species have only to sustain themselves, no longer to come into\nexistence, we see here and there some such forethought of nature extending\nto the future, and abstracting as it were from the process of time, a\nself-adaptation of what is to what is yet to come. The bird builds the\nnest for the young which it does not yet know; the beaver constructs a dam\nthe object of which is unknown to it; ants, marmots, and bees lay in\nprovision for the winter they have never experienced; the spider and the\nant-lion make snares, as if with deliberate cunning, for future unknown\nprey; insects deposit their eggs where the coming brood finds future\nnourishment. In the spring-time the female flower of the diœcian\nvalisneria unwinds the spirals of its stalk, by which till now it was held\nat the bottom of the water, and thus rises to the surface. Just then the\nmale flower, which grows on a short stalk from the bottom, breaks away,\nand so, at the sacrifice of its life, reaches the surface, where it swims\nabout in search of the female. The latter is fructified, and then draws\nitself down again to the bottom by contracting its spirals, and there the\nfruit grows.(41) I must again refer here to the larva of the male\nstag-beetle, which makes the hole in the wood for its metamorphosis as big\nagain as the female does, in order to have room for its future horns. The\ninstinct of animals in general gives us the best illustration of what\nremains of teleology in nature. For as instinct is an action, like that\nwhich is guided by the conception of an end, and yet is entirely without\nthis; so all construction of nature resembles that which is guided by the\nconception of an end, and yet is entirely without it. For in the outer as\nin the inner teleology of nature, what we are obliged to think as means\nand end is, in every case, _the manifestation of the unity of the one will\nso thoroughly agreeing with itself_, which has assumed multiplicity in\nspace and time for our manner of knowing.\n\nThe reciprocal adaptation and self-accommodation of phenomena that springs\nfrom this unity cannot, however, annul the inner contradiction which\nappears in the universal conflict of nature described above, and which is\nessential to the will. That harmony goes only so far as to render possible\nthe duration of the world and the different kinds of existences in it,\nwhich without it would long since have perished. Therefore it only extends\nto the continuance of the species, and the general conditions of life, but\nnot to that of the individual. If, then, by reason of that harmony and\naccommodation, the _species_ in organised nature and the _universal\nforces_ in unorganised nature continue to exist beside each other, and\nindeed support each other reciprocally, on the other hand, the inner\ncontradiction of the will which objectifies itself in all these ideas\nshows itself in the ceaseless internecine war of the _individuals_ of\nthese species, and in the constant struggle of the _manifestations_ of\nthese natural forces with each other, as we pointed out above. The scene\nand the object of this conflict is matter, which they try to wrest from\neach other, and also space and time, the combination of which through the\nform of causality is, in fact, matter, as was explained in the First\nBook.(42)",

    "page_content": "the hope that, so far as is possible in the case of an entirely new\nthought, which cannot be quite free from traces of the individuality in\nwhich it originated, I have succeeded in conveying to the reader the\ncomplete certainty that this world in which we live and have our being is\nin its whole nature through and through _will_, and at the same time\nthrough and through _idea_: that this idea, as such, already presupposes a\nform, object and subject, is therefore relative; and if we ask what\nremains if we take away this form, and all those forms which are\nsubordinate to it, and which express the principle of sufficient reason,\nthe answer must be that as something _toto genere_ different from idea,\nthis can be nothing but _will_, which is thus properly the\n_thing-in-itself_. Every one finds that he himself is this will, in which\nthe real nature of the world consists, and he also finds that he is the\nknowing subject, whose idea the whole world is, the world which exists\nonly in relation to his consciousness, as its necessary supporter. Every\none is thus himself in a double aspect the whole world, the microcosm;\nfinds both sides whole and complete in himself. And what he thus\nrecognises as his own real being also exhausts the being of the whole\nworld—the macrocosm; thus the world, like man, is through and through\n_will_, and through and through _idea_, and nothing more than this. So we\nsee the philosophy of Thales, which concerned the macrocosm, unite at this\npoint with that of Socrates, which dealt with the microcosm, for the\nobject of both is found to be the same. But all the knowledge that has\nbeen communicated in the two first books will gain greater completeness,\nand consequently greater certainty, from the two following books, in which\nI hope that several questions that have more or less distinctly arisen in\nthe course of our work will also be sufficiently answered.\n\nIn the meantime _one_ such question may be more particularly considered,\nfor it can only properly arise so long as one has not fully penetrated the\nmeaning of the foregoing exposition, and may so far serve as an\nillustration of it. It is this: Every will is a will towards something,\nhas an object, an end of its willing; what then is the final end, or\ntowards what is that will striving that is exhibited to us as the\nbeing-in-itself of the world? This question rests, like so many others,\nupon the confusion of the thing-in-itself with the manifestation. The\nprinciple of sufficient reason, of which the law of motivation is also a\nform, extends only to the latter, not to the former. It is only of\nphenomena, of individual things, that a ground can be given, never of the\nwill itself, nor of the Idea in which it adequately objectifies itself. So\nthen of every particular movement or change of any kind in nature, a cause\nis to be sought, that is, a condition that of necessity produced it, but\nnever of the natural force itself which is revealed in this and\ninnumerable similar phenomena; and it is therefore simple\nmisunderstanding, arising from want of consideration, to ask for a cause\nof gravity, electricity, and so on. Only if one had somehow shown that\ngravity and electricity were not original special forces of nature, but\nonly the manifestations of a more general force already known, would it be\nallowable to ask for the cause which made this force produce the phenomena\nof gravity or of electricity here. All this has been explained at length\nabove. In the same way every particular act of will of a knowing\nindividual (which is itself only a manifestation of will as the\nthing-in-itself) has necessarily a motive without which that act would\nnever have occurred; but just as material causes contain merely the\ndetermination that at this time, in this place, and in this matter, a\nmanifestation of this or that natural force must take place, so the motive\ndetermines only the act of will of a knowing being, at this time, in this\nplace, and under these circumstances, as a particular act, but by no means\ndetermines that that being wills in general or wills in this manner; this\nis the expression of his intelligible character, which, as will itself,\nthe thing-in-itself, is without ground, for it lies outside the province\nof the principle of sufficient reason. Therefore every man has permanent\naims and motives by which he guides his conduct, and he can always give an\naccount of his particular actions; but if he were asked why he wills at\nall, or why in general he wills to exist, he would have no answer, and the\nquestion would indeed seem to him meaningless; and this would be just the\nexpression of his consciousness that he himself is nothing but will, whose\nwilling stands by itself and requires more particular determination by\nmotives only in its individual acts at each point of time.\n\nIn fact, freedom from all aim, from all limits, belongs to the nature of\nthe will, which is an endless striving. This was already touched on above\nin the reference to centrifugal force. It also discloses itself in its\nsimplest form in the lowest grade of the objectification of will, in\ngravitation, which we see constantly exerting itself, though a final goal\nis obviously impossible for it. For if, according to its will, all\nexisting matter were collected in one mass, yet within this mass gravity,\never striving towards the centre, would still wage war with\nimpenetrability as rigidity or elasticity. The tendency of matter can\ntherefore only be confined, never completed or appeased. But this is\nprecisely the case with all tendencies of all phenomena of will. Every\nattained end is also the beginning of a new course, and so on _ad\ninfinitum_. The plant raises its manifestation from the seed through the\nstem and the leaf to the blossom and the fruit, which again is the\nbeginning of a new seed, a new individual, that runs through the old\ncourse, and so on through endless time. Such also is the life of the\nanimal; procreation is its highest point, and after attaining to it, the\nlife of the first individual quickly or slowly sinks, while a new life\nensures to nature the endurance of the species and repeats the same\nphenomena. Indeed, the constant renewal of the matter of every organism is\nalso to be regarded as merely the manifestation of this continual pressure\nand change, and physiologists are now ceasing to hold that it is the\nnecessary reparation of the matter wasted in motion, for the possible\nwearing out of the machine can by no means be equivalent to the support it\nis constantly receiving through nourishment. Eternal becoming, endless\nflux, characterises the revelation of the inner nature of will. Finally,\nthe same thing shows itself in human endeavours and desires, which always\ndelude us by presenting their satisfaction as the final end of will. As\nsoon as we attain to them they no longer appear the same, and therefore\nthey soon grow stale, are forgotten, and though not openly disowned, are\nyet always thrown aside as vanished illusions. We are fortunate enough if\nthere still remains something to wish for and to strive after, that the\ngame may be kept up of constant transition from desire to satisfaction,\nand from satisfaction to a new desire, the rapid course of which is called\nhappiness, and the slow course sorrow, and does not sink into that\nstagnation that shows itself in fearful ennui that paralyses life, vain\nyearning without a definite object, deadening languor. According to all\nthis, when the will is enlightened by knowledge, it always knows what it\nwills now and here, never what it wills in general; every particular act\nof will has its end, the whole will has none; just as every particular\nphenomenon of nature is determined by a sufficient cause so far as\nconcerns its appearance in this place at this time, but the force which\nmanifests itself in it has no general cause, for it belongs to the\nthing-in-itself, to the groundless will. The single example of\nself-knowledge of the will as a whole is the idea as a whole, the whole\nworld of perception. It is the objectification, the revelation, the mirror\nof the will. What the will expresses in it will be the subject of our\nfurther consideration.(43)\n\nTHIRD BOOK. THE WORLD AS IDEA.\n\nSecond Aspect.

    "page_content": "a subject. In the Second Book we considered it from its other side, and\nfound that in this aspect it is _will_, which proved to be simply that\nwhich this world is besides being idea. In accordance with this knowledge\nwe called the world as idea, both as a whole and in its parts, the\n_objectification of will_, which therefore means the will become object,\n_i.e._, idea. Further, we remember that this objectification of will was\nfound to have many definite grades, in which, with gradually increasing\ndistinctness and completeness, the nature of will appears in the idea,\nthat is to say, presents itself as object. In these grades we already\nrecognised the Platonic Ideas, for the grades are just the determined\nspecies, or the original unchanging forms and qualities of all natural\nbodies, both organised and unorganised, and also the general forces which\nreveal themselves according to natural laws. These Ideas, then, as a whole\nexpress themselves in innumerable individuals and particulars, and are\nrelated to these as archetypes to their copies. The multiplicity of such\nindividuals is only conceivable through time and space, their appearing\nand passing away through causality, and in all these forms we recognise\nmerely the different modes of the principle of sufficient reason, which is\nthe ultimate principle of all that is finite, of all individual existence,\nand the universal form of the idea as it appears in the knowledge of the\nindividual as such. The Platonic Idea, on the other hand, does not come\nunder this principle, and has therefore neither multiplicity nor change.\nWhile the individuals in which it expresses itself are innumerable, and\nunceasingly come into being and pass away, it remains unchanged as one and\nthe same, and the principle of sufficient reason has for it no meaning.\nAs, however, this is the form under which all knowledge of the subject\ncomes, so far as the subject knows as an _individual_, the Ideas lie quite\noutside the sphere of its knowledge. If, therefore, the Ideas are to\nbecome objects of knowledge, this can only happen by transcending the\nindividuality of the knowing subject. The more exact and detailed\nexplanation of this is what will now occupy our attention.",

    "page_content": "the preceding book I have succeeded in producing the conviction that what\nis called in the Kantian philosophy the _thing-in-itself_, and appears\nthere as so significant, and yet so obscure and paradoxical a doctrine,\nand especially on account of the manner in which Kant introduced it as an\ninference from the caused to the cause, was considered a stumbling-stone,\nand, in fact, the weak side of his philosophy,—that this, I say, if it is\nreached by the entirely different way by which we have arrived at it, is\nnothing but the _will_ when the sphere of that conception is extended and\ndefined in the way I have shown. I hope, further, that after what has been\nsaid there will be no hesitation in recognising the definite grades of the\nobjectification of the will, which is the inner reality of the world, to\nbe what Plato called the _eternal Ideas_ or unchangeable forms (ειδῆ); a\ndoctrine which is regarded as the principal, but at the same time the most\nobscure and paradoxical dogma of his system, and has been the subject of\nreflection and controversy of ridicule and of reverence to so many and\nsuch differently endowed minds in the course of many centuries.\n\nIf now the will is for us the _thing-in-itself_, and the Idea is the\nimmediate objectivity of that will at a definite grade, we find that\nKant’s thing-in-itself, and Plato’s Idea, which to him is the only οντως\nον, these two great obscure paradoxes of the two greatest philosophers of\nthe West are not indeed identical, but yet very closely related, and only\ndistinguished by a single circumstance. The purport of these two great\nparadoxes, with all inner harmony and relationship, is yet so very\ndifferent on account of the remarkable diversity of the individuality of\ntheir authors, that they are the best commentary on each other, for they\nare like two entirely different roads that conduct us to the same goal.\nThis is easily made clear. What Kant says is in substance this:—“Time,\nspace, and causality are not determinations of the thing-in-itself, but\nbelong only to its phenomenal existence, for they are nothing but the\nforms of our knowledge. Since, however, all multiplicity, and all coming\ninto being and passing away, are only possible through time, space, and\ncausality, it follows that they also belong only to the phenomenon, not to\nthe thing-in-itself. But as our knowledge is conditioned by these forms,\nthe whole of experience is only knowledge of the phenomenon, not of the\nthing-in-itself; therefore its laws cannot be made valid for the\nthing-in-itself. This extends even to our own _ego_, and we know it only\nas phenomenon, and not according to what it may be in itself.” This is the\nmeaning and content of the doctrine of Kant in the important respect we\nare considering. What Plato says is this:—“The things of this world which\nour senses perceive have no true being; _they always become, they never\nare:_ they have only a relative being; they all exist merely in and\nthrough their relations to each other; their whole being may, therefore,\nquite as well be called a non-being. They are consequently not objects of\na true knowledge (επιστημη), for such a knowledge can only be of what\nexists for itself, and always in the same way; they, on the contrary, are\nonly the objects of an opinion based on sensation (δοξα μετ᾽ αισθησεως\nαλογου). So long as we are confined to the perception of these, we are\nlike men who sit in a dark cave, bound so fast that they cannot turn their\nheads, and who see nothing but the shadows of real things which pass\nbetween them and a fire burning behind them, the light of which casts the\nshadows on the wall opposite them; and even of themselves and of each\nother they see only the shadows on the wall. Their wisdom would thus\nconsist in predicting the order of the shadows learned from experience.\nThe real archetypes, on the other hand, to which these shadows correspond,\nthe eternal Ideas, the original forms of all things, can alone be said to\nhave true being (οντως ον), because they _always are, but never become nor\npass away_. To them belongs _no multiplicity_; for each of them is\naccording to its nature only one, for it is the archetype itself, of which\nall particular transitory things of the same kind which are named after it\nare copies or shadows. They have also _no coming into being nor passing\naway_, for they are truly being, never becoming nor vanishing, like their\nfleeting shadows. (It is necessarily presupposed, however, in these two\nnegative definitions, that time, space, and causality have no significance\nor validity for these Ideas, and that they do not exist in them.) Of these\nonly can there be true knowledge, for the object of such knowledge can\nonly be that which always and in every respect (thus in-itself) is; not\nthat which is and again is not, according as we look at it.” This is\nPlato’s doctrine. It is clear, and requires no further proof that the\ninner meaning of both doctrines is entirely the same; that both explain\nthe visible world as a manifestation, which in itself is nothing, and\nwhich only has meaning and a borrowed reality through that which expresses\nitself in it (in the one case the thing-in-itself, in the other the Idea).\nTo this last, which has true being, all the forms of that phenomenal\nexistence, even the most universal and essential, are, according to both\ndoctrines, entirely foreign. In order to disown these forms Kant has\ndirectly expressed them even in abstract terms, and distinctly refused\ntime, space, and causality as mere forms of the phenomenon to the\nthing-in-itself. Plato, on the other hand, did not attain to the fullest\nexpression, and has only distinctly refused these forms to his Ideas in\nthat he denies of the Ideas what is only possible through these forms,\nmultiplicity of similar things, coming into being and passing away. Though\nit is perhaps superfluous, I should like to illustrate this remarkable and\nimportant agreement by an example. There stands before us, let us suppose,\nan animal in the full activity of life. Plato would say, “This animal has\nno true existence, but merely an apparent existence, a constant becoming,\na relative existence which may just as well be called non-being as being.\nOnly the Idea which expresses itself in that animal is truly ‘being,’ or\nthe animal in-itself (αυτο το θηριον), which is dependent upon nothing,\nbut is in and for itself (καθ᾽ ἑαυτο, αει ὡς αυτως); it has not become, it\nwill not end, but always is in the same way (αει ον, και μηδεποτε ουτε\nγυγνομενον ουτε απολλυμενον). If now we recognise its Idea in this animal,\nit is all one and of no importance whether we have this animal now before\nus or its progenitor of a thousand years ago, whether it is here or in a\ndistant land, whether it presents itself in this or that manner, position,\nor action; whether, lastly, it is this or any other individual of the same\nspecies; all this is nothing, and only concerns the phenomenon; the Idea\nof the animal alone has true being, and is the object of real knowledge.”\nSo Plato; Kant would say something of this kind, “This animal is a\nphenomenon in time, space, and causality, which are collectively the\nconditions _a priori_ of the possibility of experience, lying in our\nfaculty of knowledge, not determinations of the thing-in-itself. Therefore\nthis animal as we perceive it at this definite point of time, in this\nparticular place, as an individual in the connection of experience\n(_i.e._, in the chain of causes and effects), which has come into being,\nand will just as necessarily pass away, is not a thing-in-itself, but a\nphenomenon which only exists in relation to our knowledge. To know it as\nwhat it may be in itself, that is to say, independent of all the\ndeterminations which lie in time, space, and causality, would demand\nanother kind of knowledge than that which is possible for us through the\nsenses and the understanding.”\n\nIn order to bring Kant’s mode of expression nearer the Platonic, we might\nsay: Time, space, and causality are that arrangement of our intellect by\nvirtue of which the _one_ being of each kind which alone really is,\nmanifests itself to us as a multiplicity of similar beings, constantly\nappearing and disappearing in endless succession. The apprehension of\nthings by means of and in accordance with this arrangement is _immanent_\nknowledge; that, on the other hand, which is conscious of the true state\nof the case, is _transcendental_ knowledge. The latter is obtained _in\nabstracto_ through the criticism of pure reason, but in exceptional cases\nit may also appear intuitively. This last is an addition of my own, which\nI am endeavouring in this Third Book to explain.\n\nIf the doctrine of Kant had ever been properly understood and grasped, and\nsince Kant’s time that of Plato, if men had truly and earnestly reflected\non the inner meaning and content of the teaching of these two great\nmasters, instead of involving themselves in the technicalities of the one\nand writing parodies of the style of the other, they could not have failed\nto discern long ago to what an extent these two great philosophers agree,\nand that the true meaning, the aim of both systems, is the same. Not only\nwould they have refrained from constantly comparing Plato to Leibnitz, on\nwhom his spirit certainly did not rest, or indeed to a well-known\ngentleman who is still alive,(44) as if they wanted to mock the manes of\nthe great thinker of the past; but they would have advanced much farther\nin general, or rather they would not have fallen so disgracefully far\nbehind as they have in the last forty years. They would not have let\nthemselves be led by the nose, to-day by one vain boaster and to-morrow by\nanother, nor would they have opened the nineteenth century, which promised\nso much in Germany, with the philosophical farces that were performed over\nthe grave of Kant (as the ancients sometimes did at the funeral obsequies\nof their dead), and which deservedly called forth the derision of other\nnations, for such things least become the earnest and strait-laced German.\nBut so small is the chosen public of true philosophers, that even students\nwho understand are but scantily brought them by the centuries—Εισι δη\nναρθηκοφοροι μεν πολλοι, βακχοι δε γε παυροι (_Thyrsigeri quidem multi,\nBaachi vero pauci_). Ἡ ατιμια φιλοσοφιᾳ δια ταυτα προσπεπτωκεν, ὁτι ου κατ\nαξιαν αυτης ἁπτονται; ου γαρ νοθους εδει ἁπτεσθαι, αλλα γνησιους (_Eam ob\nrem philosophia in infamiam incidit, quad non pro dignitate ipsam\nattingunt: neque enim a spuriis, sad a legitimis erat\nattrectanda_).—Plato.\n\nMen followed the words,—such words as “_a priori_ ideas,” “forms of\nperception and thought existing in consciousness independently of\nexperience,” “fundamental conceptions of the pure understanding,” &c.,\n&c.,—and asked whether Plato’s Ideas, which were also original\nconceptions, and besides this were supposed to be reminiscences of a\nperception before life of the truly real things, were in some way the same\nas Kant’s forms of perception and thought, which lie _a priori_ in our\nconsciousness. On account of some slight resemblance in the expression of\nthese two entirely different doctrines, the Kantian doctrine of the forms\nwhich limit the knowledge of the individual to the phenomenon, and the\nPlatonic doctrine of Ideas, the knowledge of which these very forms\nexpressly deny, these so far diametrically opposed doctrines were\ncarefully compared, and men deliberated and disputed as to whether they\nwere identical, found at last that they were not the same, and concluded\nthat Plato’s doctrine of Ideas and Kant’s “Critique of Reason” had nothing\nin common. But enough of this.(45)",

    "page_content": "and thing-in-itself are not entirely one and the same, in spite of the\ninner agreement between Kant and Plato, and the identity of the aim they\nhad before them, or the conception of the world which roused them and led\nthem to philosophise. The Idea is for us rather the direct, and therefore\nadequate, objectivity of the thing-in-itself, which is, however, itself\nthe _will_—the will as not yet objectified, not yet become idea. For the\nthing-in-itself must, even according to Kant, be free from all the forms\nconnected with knowing as such; and it is merely an error on his part (as\nis shown in the Appendix) that he did not count among these forms, before\nall others, that of being object for a subject, for it is the first and\nmost universal form of all phenomena, _i.e._, of all idea; he should\ntherefore have distinctly denied objective existence to his\nthing-in-itself, which would have saved him from a great inconsistency\nthat was soon discovered. The Platonic Idea, on the other hand, is\nnecessarily object, something known, an idea, and in that respect is\ndifferent from the thing-in-itself, but in that respect only. It has\nmerely laid aside the subordinate forms of the phenomenon, all of which we\ninclude in the principle of sufficient reason, or rather it has not yet\nassumed them; but it has retained the first and most universal form, that\nof the idea in general, the form of being object for a subject. It is the\nforms which are subordinate to this (whose general expression is the\nprinciple of sufficient reason) that multiply the Idea in particular\ntransitory individuals, whose number is a matter of complete indifference\nto the Idea. The principle of sufficient reason is thus again the form\ninto which the Idea enters when it appears in the knowledge of the subject\nas individual. The particular thing that manifests itself in accordance\nwith the principle of sufficient reason is thus only an indirect\nobjectification of the thing-in-itself (which is the will), for between it\nand the thing-in-itself stands the Idea as the only direct objectivity of\nthe will, because it has assumed none of the special forms of knowledge as\nsuch, except that of the idea in general, _i.e._, the form of being object\nfor a subject. Therefore it alone is the most _adequate objectivity_ of\nthe will or thing-in-itself which is possible; indeed it is the whole\nthing-in-itself, only under the form of the idea; and here lies the ground\nof the great agreement between Plato and Kant, although, in strict\naccuracy, that of which they speak is not the same. But the particular\nthings are no really adequate objectivity of the will, for in them it is\nobscured by those forms whose general expression is the principle of\nsufficient reason, but which are conditions of the knowledge which belongs\nto the individual as such. If it is allowable to draw conclusions from an\nimpossible presupposition, we would, in fact, no longer know particular\nthings, nor events, nor change, nor multiplicity, but would comprehend\nonly Ideas,—only the grades of the objectification of that one will, of\nthe thing-in-itself, in pure unclouded knowledge. Consequently our world\nwould be a _nunc stans_, if it were not that, as knowing subjects, we are\nalso individuals, _i.e._, our perceptions come to us through the medium of\na body, from the affections of which they proceed, and which is itself\nonly concrete willing, objectivity of the will, and thus is an object\namong objects, and as such comes into the knowing consciousness in the\nonly way in which an object can, through the forms of the principle of\nsufficient reason, and consequently already presupposes, and therefore\nbrings in, time, and all other forms which that principle expresses. Time\nis only the broken and piecemeal view which the individual being has of\nthe Ideas, which are outside time, and consequently _eternal_. Therefore\nPlato says time is the moving picture of eternity: αιωνος εικων κινητη ὁ\nχρονος.(46)",

    "page_content": "which is subject to the principle of sufficient reason, and this form of\nknowledge excludes the Ideas, it is certain that if it is possible for us\nto raise ourselves from the knowledge of particular things to that of the\nIdeas, this can only happen by an alteration taking place in the subject\nwhich is analogous and corresponds to the great change of the whole nature\nof the object, and by virtue of which the subject, so far as it knows an\nIdea, is no more individual.\n\nIt will be remembered from the preceding book that knowledge in general\nbelongs to the objectification of will at its higher grades, and\nsensibility, nerves, and brain, just like the other parts of the organised\nbeing, are the expression of the will at this stage of its objectivity,\nand therefore the idea which appears through them is also in the same way\nbound to the service of will as a means (μηχανη) for the attainment of its\nnow complicated (πολυτελεστερα) aims for sustaining a being of manifold\nrequirements. Thus originally and according to its nature, knowledge is\ncompletely subject to the will, and, like the immediate object, which, by\nmeans of the application of the law of causality, is its starting-point,\nall knowledge which proceeds in accordance with the principle of\nsufficient reason remains in a closer or more distant relation to the\nwill. For the individual finds his body as an object among objects, to all\nof which it is related and connected according to the principle of\nsufficient reason. Thus all investigations of these relations and\nconnections lead back to his body, and consequently to his will. Since it\nis the principle of sufficient reason which places the objects in this\nrelation to the body, and, through it, to the will, the one endeavour of\nthe knowledge which is subject to this principle will be to find out the\nrelations in which objects are placed to each other through this\nprinciple, and thus to trace their innumerable connections in space, time,\nand causality. For only through these is the object _interesting_ to the\nindividual, _i.e._, related to the will. Therefore the knowledge which is\nsubject to the will knows nothing further of objects than their relations,\nknows the objects only so far as they exist at this time, in this place,\nunder these circumstances, from these causes, and with these effects—in a\nword, as particular things; and if all these relations were to be taken\naway, the objects would also have disappeared for it, because it knew\nnothing more about them. We must not disguise the fact that what the\nsciences consider in things is also in reality nothing more than this;\ntheir relations, the connections of time and space, the causes of natural\nchanges, the resemblance of forms, the motives of actions,—thus merely\nrelations. What distinguishes science from ordinary knowledge is merely\nits systematic form, the facilitating of knowledge by the comprehension of\nall particulars in the universal, by means of the subordination of\nconcepts, and the completeness of knowledge which is thereby attained. All\nrelation has itself only a relative existence; for example, all being in\ntime is also non-being; for time is only that by means of which opposite\ndeterminations can belong to the same thing; therefore every phenomenon\nwhich is in time again is not, for what separates its beginning from its\nend is only time, which is essentially a fleeting, inconstant, and\nrelative thing, here called duration. But time is the most universal form\nof all objects of the knowledge which is subject to the will, and the\nprototype of its other forms.\n\nKnowledge now, as a rule, remains always subordinate to the service of the\nwill, as indeed it originated for this service, and grew, so to speak, to\nthe will, as the head to the body. In the case of the brutes this\nsubjection of knowledge to the will can never be abolished. In the case of\nmen it can be abolished only in exceptional cases, which we shall\npresently consider more closely. This distinction between man and brute is\noutwardly expressed by the difference of the relation of the head to the\nbody. In the case of the lower brutes both are deformed: in all brutes the\nhead is directed towards the earth, where the objects of its will lie;\neven in the higher species the head and the body are still far more one\nthan in the case of man, whose head seems freely set upon his body, as if\nonly carried by and not serving it. This human excellence is exhibited in\nthe highest degree by the Apollo of Belvedere; the head of the god of the\nMuses, with eyes fixed on the far distance, stands so freely on his\nshoulders that it seems wholly delivered from the body, and no more\nsubject to its cares.",

    "page_content": "regarded as only exceptional, from the common knowledge of particular\nthings to the knowledge of the Idea, takes place suddenly; for knowledge\nbreaks free from the service of the will, by the subject ceasing to be\nmerely individual, and thus becoming the pure will-less subject of\nknowledge, which no longer traces relations in accordance with the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, but rests in fixed contemplation of the\nobject presented to it, out of its connection with all others, and rises\ninto it.\n\nA full explanation is necessary to make this clear, and the reader must\nsuspend his surprise for a while, till he has grasped the whole thought\nexpressed in this work, and then it will vanish of itself.\n\nIf, raised by the power of the mind, a man relinquishes the common way of\nlooking at things, gives up tracing, under the guidance of the forms of\nthe principle of sufficient reason, their relations to each other, the\nfinal goal of which is always a relation to his own will; if he thus\nceases to consider the where, the when, the why, and the whither of\nthings, and looks simply and solely at the _what_; if, further, he does\nnot allow abstract thought, the concepts of the reason, to take possession\nof his consciousness, but, instead of all this, gives the whole power of\nhis mind to perception, sinks himself entirely in this, and lets his whole\nconsciousness be filled with the quiet contemplation of the natural object\nactually present, whether a landscape, a tree, a mountain, a building, or\nwhatever it may be; inasmuch as he _loses_ himself in this object (to use\na pregnant German idiom), _i.e._, forgets even his individuality, his\nwill, and only continues to exist as the pure subject, the clear mirror of\nthe object, so that it is as if the object alone were there, without any\none to perceive it, and he can no longer separate the perceiver from the\nperception, but both have become one, because the whole consciousness is\nfilled and occupied with one single sensuous picture; if thus the object\nhas to such an extent passed out of all relation to something outside it,\nand the subject out of all relation to the will, then that which is so\nknown is no longer the particular thing as such; but it is the _Idea_, the\neternal form, the immediate objectivity of the will at this grade; and,\ntherefore, he who is sunk in this perception is no longer individual, for\nin such perception the individual has lost himself; but he is _pure_,\nwill-less, painless, timeless _subject of knowledge_. This, which in\nitself is so remarkable (which I well know confirms the saying that\noriginated with Thomas Paine, _Du sublime au ridicule il n’y a qu’un\npas_), will by degrees become clearer and less surprising from what\nfollows. It was this that was running in Spinoza’s mind when he wrote:\n_Meus æterna est, quatenus res sub æternitatis specie __ concipit_ (Eth.\nV. pr. 31, Schol.)(47) In such contemplation the particular thing becomes\nat once the _Idea_ of its species, and the perceiving individual becomes\n_pure subject of knowledge_. The individual, as such, knows only\nparticular things; the pure subject of knowledge knows only Ideas. For the\nindividual is the subject of knowledge in its relation to a definite\nparticular manifestation of will, and in subjection to this. This\nparticular manifestation of will is, as such, subordinated to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason in all its forms; therefore, all knowledge\nwhich relates itself to it also follows the principle of sufficient\nreason, and no other kind of knowledge is fitted to be of use to the will\nbut this, which always consists merely of relations to the object. The\nknowing individual as such, and the particular things known by him, are\nalways in some place, at some time, and are links in the chain of causes\nand effects. The pure subject of knowledge and his correlative, the Idea,\nhave passed out of all these forms of the principle of sufficient reason:\ntime, place, the individual that knows, and the individual that is known,\nhave for them no meaning. When an individual knower has raised himself in\nthe manner described to be pure subject of knowledge, and at the same time\nhas raised the observed object to the Platonic Idea, the _world as idea_\nappears complete and pure, and the full objectification of the will takes\nplace, for the Platonic Idea alone is its _adequate objectivity_. The Idea\nincludes object and subject in like manner in itself, for they are its one\nform; but in it they are absolutely of equal importance; for as the object\nis here, as elsewhere, simply the idea of the subject, the subject, which\npasses entirely into the perceived object has thus become this object\nitself, for the whole consciousness is nothing but its perfectly distinct\npicture. Now this consciousness constitutes the whole _world as idea_, for\none imagines the whole of the Platonic Ideas, or grades of the objectivity\nof will, in their series passing through it. The particular things of all\ntime and space are nothing but Ideas multiplied through the principle of\nsufficient reason (the form of the knowledge of the individual as such),\nand thus obscured as regards their pure objectivity. When the Platonic\nIdea appears, in it subject and object are no longer to be distinguished,\nfor the Platonic Idea, the adequate objectivity of will, the true world as\nidea, arises only when the subject and object reciprocally fill and\npenetrate each other completely; and in the same way the knowing and the\nknown individuals, as things in themselves, are not to be distinguished.\nFor if we look entirely away from the true _world as idea_, there remains\nnothing but the _world as will_. The will is the “in-itself” of the\nPlatonic Idea, which fully objectifies it; it is also the “in-itself” of\nthe particular thing and of the individual that knows it, which objectify\nit incompletely. As will, outside the idea and all its forms, it is one\nand the same in the object contemplated and in the individual, who soars\naloft in this contemplation, and becomes conscious of himself as pure\nsubject. These two are, therefore, in themselves not different, for in\nthemselves they are will, which here knows itself; and multiplicity and\ndifference exist only as the way in which this knowledge comes to the\nwill, _i.e._, only in the phenomenon, on account of its form, the\nprinciple of sufficient reason.\n\nNow the known thing, without me as the subject of knowledge, is just as\nlittle an object, and not mere will, blind effort, as without the object,\nwithout the idea, I am a knowing subject and not mere blind will. This\nwill is in itself, _i.e._, outside the idea, one and the same with mine:\nonly in the world as idea, whose form is always at least that of subject\nand object, we are separated as the known and the knowing individual. As\nsoon as knowledge, the world as idea, is abolished, there remains nothing\nbut mere will, blind effort. That it should receive objectivity, become\nidea, supposes at once both subject and object; but that this should be\npure, complete, and adequate objectivity of the will, supposes the object\nas Platonic Idea, free from the forms of the principle of sufficient\nreason, and the subject as the pure subject of knowledge, free from\nindividuality and subjection to the will.\n\nWhoever now, has, after the manner referred to, become so absorbed and\nlost in the perception of nature that he only continues to exist as the\npure knowing subject, becomes in this way directly conscious that, as\nsuch, he is the condition, that is, the supporter, of the world and all\nobjective existence; for this now shows itself as dependent upon his\nexistence. Thus he draws nature into himself, so that he sees it to be\nmerely an accident of his own being. In this sense Byron says—\n\n    “Are not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part\n      Of me and of my soul, as I of them?”\n\nBut how shall he who feels this, regard himself as absolutely transitory,\nin contrast to imperishable nature? Such a man will rather be filled with\nthe consciousness, which the Upanishad of the Veda expresses: _Hæ omnes\ncreaturæ in totum ego sum, et præter me aliud ens non est_ (Oupnek’hat, i.\n122).(48)",

    "page_content": "is absolutely necessary that we should learn to distinguish the will as\nthing-in-itself from its adequate objectivity, and also the different\ngrades in which this appears more and more distinctly and fully, _i.e._,\nthe Ideas themselves, from the merely phenomenal existence of these Ideas\nin the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, the restricted method\nof knowledge of the individual. We shall then agree with Plato when he\nattributes actual being only to the Ideas, and allows only an illusive,\ndream-like existence to things in space and time, the real world for the\nindividual. Then we shall understand how one and the same Idea reveals\nitself in so many phenomena, and presents its nature only bit by bit to\nthe individual, one side after another. Then we shall also distinguish the\nIdea itself from the way in which its manifestation appears in the\nobservation of the individual, and recognise the former as essential and\nthe latter as unessential. Let us consider this with the help of examples\ntaken from the most insignificant things, and also from the greatest. When\nthe clouds move, the figures which they form are not essential, but\nindifferent to them; but that as elastic vapour they are pressed together,\ndrifted along, spread out, or torn asunder by the force of the wind: this\nis their nature, the essence of the forces which objectify themselves in\nthem, the Idea; their actual forms are only for the individual observer.\nTo the brook that flows over stones, the eddies, the waves, the\nfoam-flakes which it forms are indifferent and unessential; but that it\nfollows the attraction of gravity, and behaves as inelastic, perfectly\nmobile, formless, transparent fluid: this is its nature; this, _if known\nthrough perception_, is its Idea; these accidental forms are only for us\nso long as we know as individuals. The ice on the window-pane forms itself\ninto crystals according to the laws of crystallisation, which reveal the\nessence of the force of nature that appears here, exhibit the Idea; but\nthe trees and flowers which it traces on the pane are unessential, and are\nonly there for us. What appears in the clouds, the brook, and the crystal\nis the weakest echo of that will which appears more fully in the plant,\nmore fully still in the beast, and most fully in man. But only the\nessential in all these grades of its objectification constitutes the Idea;\non the other hand, its unfolding or development, because broken up in the\nforms of the principle of sufficient reason into a multiplicity of\nmany-sided phenomena, is unessential to the Idea, lies merely in the kind\nof knowledge that belongs to the individual and has reality only for this.\nThe same thing necessarily holds good of the unfolding of that Idea which\nis the completest objectivity of will. Therefore, the history of the human\nrace, the throng of events, the change of times, the multifarious forms of\nhuman life in different lands and countries, all this is only the\naccidental form of the manifestation of the Idea, does not belong to the\nIdea itself, in which alone lies the adequate objectivity of the will, but\nonly to the phenomenon which appears in the knowledge of the individual,\nand is just as foreign, unessential, and indifferent to the Idea itself as\nthe figures which they assume are to the clouds, the form of its eddies\nand foam-flakes to the brook, or its trees and flowers to the ice.\n\nTo him who has thoroughly grasped this, and can distinguish between the\nwill and the Idea, and between the Idea and its manifestation, the events\nof the world will have significance only so far as they are the letters\nout of which we may read the Idea of man, but not in and for themselves.\nHe will not believe with the vulgar that time may produce something\nactually new and significant; that through it, or in it, something\nabsolutely real may attain to existence, or indeed that it itself as a\nwhole has beginning and end, plan and development, and in some way has for\nits final aim the highest perfection (according to their conception) of\nthe last generation of man, whose life is a brief thirty years. Therefore\nhe will just as little, with Homer, people a whole Olympus with gods to\nguide the events of time, as, with Ossian, he will take the forms of the\nclouds for individual beings; for, as we have said, both have just as much\nmeaning as regards the Idea which appears in them. In the manifold forms\nof human life and in the unceasing change of events, he will regard the\nIdea only as the abiding and essential, in which the will to live has its\nfullest objectivity, and which shows its different sides in the\ncapacities, the passions, the errors and the excellences of the human\nrace; in self-interest, hatred, love, fear, boldness, frivolity,\nstupidity, slyness, wit, genius, and so forth, all of which crowding\ntogether and combining in thousands of forms (individuals), continually\ncreate the history of the great and the little world, in which it is all\nthe same whether they are set in motion by nuts or by crowns. Finally, he\nwill find that in the world it is the same as in the dramas of Gozzi, in\nall of which the same persons appear, with like intention, and with a like\nfate; the motives and incidents are certainly different in each piece, but\nthe spirit of the incidents is the same; the actors in one piece know\nnothing of the incidents of another, although they performed in it\nthemselves; therefore, after all experience of former pieces, Pantaloon\nhas become no more agile or generous, Tartaglia no more conscientious,\nBrighella no more courageous, and Columbine no more modest.\n\nSuppose we were allowed for once a clearer glance into the kingdom of the\npossible, and over the whole chain of causes and effects; if the\nearth-spirit appeared and showed us in a picture all the greatest men,\nenlighteners of the world, and heroes, that chance destroyed before they\nwere ripe for their work; then the great events that would have changed\nthe history of the world and brought in periods of the highest culture and\nenlightenment, but which the blindest chance, the most insignificant\naccident, hindered at the outset; lastly, the splendid powers of great\nmen, that would have enriched whole ages of the world, but which, either\nmisled by error or passion, or compelled by necessity, they squandered\nuselessly on unworthy or unfruitful objects, or even wasted in play. If we\nsaw all this, we would shudder and lament at the thought of the lost\ntreasures of whole periods of the world. But the earth-spirit would smile\nand say, “The source from which the individuals and their powers proceed\nis inexhaustible and unending as time and space; for, like these forms of\nall phenomena, they also are only phenomena, visibility of the will. No\nfinite measure can exhaust that infinite source; therefore an undiminished\neternity is always open for the return of any event or work that was\nnipped in the bud. In this world of phenomena true loss is just as little\npossible as true gain. The will alone is; it is the thing in-itself, and\nthe source of all these phenomena. Its self-knowledge and its assertion or\ndenial, which is then decided upon, is the only event in-itself.”(49)",

    "page_content": "deduces them in accordance with the law of motivation, a law that\ndetermines the self-manifesting will wherever it is enlightened by\nknowledge. At the lowest grades of its objectivity, where it still acts\nwithout knowledge, natural science, in the form of etiology, treats of the\nlaws of the changes of its phenomena, and, in the form of morphology, of\nwhat is permanent in them. This almost endless task is lightened by the\naid of concepts, which comprehend what is general in order that we may\ndeduce what is particular from it. Lastly, mathematics treats of the mere\nforms, time and space, in which the Ideas, broken up into multiplicity,\nappear for the knowledge of the subject as individual. All these, of which\nthe common name is science, proceed according to the principle of\nsufficient reason in its different forms, and their theme is always the\nphenomenon, its laws, connections, and the relations which result from\nthem. But what kind of knowledge is concerned with that which is outside\nand independent of all relations, that which alone is really essential to\nthe world, the true content of its phenomena, that which is subject to no\nchange, and therefore is known with equal truth for all time, in a word,\nthe _Ideas_, which are the direct and adequate objectivity of the thing\nin-itself, the will? We answer, _Art_, the work of genius. It repeats or\nreproduces the eternal Ideas grasped through pure contemplation, the\nessential and abiding in all the phenomena of the world; and according to\nwhat the material is in which it reproduces, it is sculpture or painting,\npoetry or music. Its one source is the knowledge of Ideas; its one aim the\ncommunication of this knowledge. While science, following the unresting\nand inconstant stream of the fourfold forms of reason and consequent, with\neach end attained sees further, and can never reach a final goal nor\nattain full satisfaction, any more than by running we can reach the place\nwhere the clouds touch the horizon; art, on the contrary, is everywhere at\nits goal. For it plucks the object of its contemplation out of the stream\nof the world’s course, and has it isolated before it. And this particular\nthing, which in that stream was a small perishing part, becomes to art the\nrepresentative of the whole, an equivalent of the endless multitude in\nspace and time. It therefore pauses at this particular thing; the course\nof time stops; the relations vanish for it; only the essential, the Idea,\nis its object. We may, therefore, accurately define it as the _way of\nviewing things independent of the principle of sufficient reason_, in\nopposition to the way of viewing them which proceeds in accordance with\nthat principle, and which is the method of experience and of science. This\nlast method of considering things may be compared to a line infinitely\nextended in a horizontal direction, and the former to a vertical line\nwhich cuts it at any point. The method of viewing things which proceeds in\naccordance with the principle of sufficient reason is the rational method,\nand it alone is valid and of use in practical life and in science. The\nmethod which looks away from the content of this principle is the method\nof genius, which is only valid and of use in art. The first is the method\nof Aristotle; the second is, on the whole, that of Plato. The first is\nlike the mighty storm, that rushes along without beginning and without\naim, bending, agitating, and carrying away everything before it; the\nsecond is like the silent sunbeam, that pierces through the storm quite\nunaffected by it. The first is like the innumerable showering drops of the\nwaterfall, which, constantly changing, never rest for an instant; the\nsecond is like the rainbow, quietly resting on this raging torrent. Only\nthrough the pure contemplation described above, which ends entirely in the\nobject, can Ideas be comprehended; and the nature of _genius_ consists in\npre-eminent capacity for such contemplation. Now, as this requires that a\nman should entirely forget himself and the relations in which he stands,\n_genius_ is simply the completest _objectivity_, _i.e._, the objective\ntendency of the mind, as opposed to the subjective, which is directed to\none’s own self—in other words, to the will. Thus genius is the faculty of\ncontinuing in the state of pure perception, of losing oneself in\nperception, and of enlisting in this service the knowledge which\noriginally existed only for the service of the will; that is to say,\ngenius is the power of leaving one’s own interests, wishes, and aims\nentirely out of sight, thus of entirely renouncing one’s own personality\nfor a time, so as to remain _pure knowing subject_, clear vision of the\nworld; and this not merely at moments, but for a sufficient length of\ntime, and with sufficient consciousness, to enable one to reproduce by\ndeliberate art what has thus been apprehended, and “to fix in lasting\nthoughts the wavering images that float before the mind.” It is as if,\nwhen genius appears in an individual, a far larger measure of the power of\nknowledge falls to his lot than is necessary for the service of an\nindividual will; and this superfluity of knowledge, being free, now\nbecomes subject purified from will, a clear mirror of the inner nature of\nthe world. This explains the activity, amounting even to disquietude, of\nmen of genius, for the present can seldom satisfy them, because it does\nnot fill their consciousness. This gives them that restless aspiration,\nthat unceasing desire for new things, and for the contemplation of lofty\nthings, and also that longing that is hardly ever satisfied, for men of\nsimilar nature and of like stature, to whom they might communicate\nthemselves; whilst the common mortal, entirely filled and satisfied by the\ncommon present, ends in it, and finding everywhere his like, enjoys that\npeculiar satisfaction in daily life that is denied to genius.\n\nImagination has rightly been recognised as an essential element of genius;\nit has sometimes even been regarded as identical with it; but this is a\nmistake. As the objects of genius are the eternal Ideas, the permanent,\nessential forms of the world and all its phenomena, and as the knowledge\nof the Idea is necessarily knowledge through perception, is not abstract,\nthe knowledge of the genius would be limited to the Ideas of the objects\nactually present to his person, and dependent upon the chain of\ncircumstances that brought these objects to him, if his imagination did\nnot extend his horizon far beyond the limits of his actual personal\nexistence, and thus enable him to construct the whole out of the little\nthat comes into his own actual apperception, and so to let almost all\npossible scenes of life pass before him in his own consciousness. Further,\nthe actual objects are almost always very imperfect copies of the Ideas\nexpressed in them; therefore the man of genius requires imagination in\norder to see in things, not that which Nature has actually made, but that\nwhich she endeavoured to make, yet could not because of that conflict of\nher forms among themselves which we referred to in the last book. We shall\nreturn to this farther on in treating of sculpture. The imagination then\nextends the intellectual horizon of the man of genius beyond the objects\nwhich actually present themselves to him, both as regards quality and\nquantity. Therefore extraordinary strength of imagination accompanies, and\nis indeed a necessary condition of genius. But the converse does not hold,\nfor strength of imagination does not indicate genius; on the contrary, men\nwho have no touch of genius may have much imagination. For as it is\npossible to consider a real object in two opposite ways, purely\nobjectively, the way of genius grasping its Idea, or in the common way,\nmerely in the relations in which it stands to other objects and to one’s\nown will, in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason, it is\nalso possible to perceive an imaginary object in both of these ways.\nRegarded in the first way, it is a means to the knowledge of the Idea, the\ncommunication of which is the work of art; in the second case, the\nimaginary object is used to build castles in the air congenial to egotism\nand the individual humour, and which for the moment delude and gratify;\nthus only the relations of the phantasies so linked together are known.\nThe man who indulges in such an amusement is a dreamer; he will easily\nmingle those fancies that delight his solitude with reality, and so unfit\nhimself for real life: perhaps he will write them down, and then we shall\nhave the ordinary novel of every description, which entertains those who\nare like him and the public at large, for the readers imagine themselves\nin the place of the hero, and then find the story very agreeable.\n\nThe common mortal, that manufacture of Nature which she produces by the\nthousand every day, is, as we have said, not capable, at least not\ncontinuously so, of observation that in every sense is wholly\ndisinterested, as sensuous contemplation, strictly so called, is. He can\nturn his attention to things only so far as they have some relation to his\nwill, however indirect it may be. Since in this respect, which never\ndemands anything but the knowledge of relations, the abstract conception\nof the thing is sufficient, and for the most part even better adapted for\nuse; the ordinary man does not linger long over the mere perception, does\nnot fix his attention long on one object, but in all that is presented to\nhim hastily seeks merely the concept under which it is to be brought, as\nthe lazy man seeks a chair, and then it interests him no further. This is\nwhy he is so soon done with everything, with works of art, objects of\nnatural beauty, and indeed everywhere with the truly significant\ncontemplation of all the scenes of life. He does not linger; only seeks to\nknow his own way in life, together with all that might at any time become\nhis way. Thus he makes topographical notes in the widest sense; over the\nconsideration of life itself as such he wastes no time. The man of genius,\non the other hand, whose excessive power of knowledge frees it at times\nfrom the service of will, dwells on the consideration of life itself,\nstrives to comprehend the Idea of each thing, not its relations to other\nthings; and in doing this he often forgets to consider his own path in\nlife, and therefore for the most part pursues it awkwardly enough. While\nto the ordinary man his faculty of knowledge is a lamp to lighten his\npath, to the man of genius it is the sun which reveals the world. This\ngreat diversity in their way of looking at life soon becomes visible in\nthe outward appearance both of the man of genius and of the ordinary\nmortal. The man in whom genius lives and works is easily distinguished by\nhis glance, which is both keen and steady, and bears the stamp of\nperception, of contemplation. This is easily seen from the likenesses of\nthe few men of genius whom Nature has produced here and there among\ncountless millions. On the other hand, in the case of an ordinary man, the\ntrue object of his contemplation, what he is prying into, can be easily\nseen from his glance, if indeed it is not quite stupid and vacant, as is\ngenerally the case. Therefore the expression of genius in a face consists\nin this, that in it a decided predominance of knowledge over will is\nvisible, and consequently there also shows itself in it a knowledge that\nis entirely devoid of relation to will, _i.e._, _pure knowing_. On the\ncontrary, in ordinary countenances there is a predominant expression of\nwill; and we see that knowledge only comes into activity under the impulse\nof will, and thus is directed merely by motives.\n\nSince the knowledge that pertains to genius, or the knowledge of Ideas, is\nthat knowledge which does not follow the principle of sufficient reason,\nso, on the other hand, the knowledge which does follow that principle is\nthat which gives us prudence and rationality in life, and which creates\nthe sciences. Thus men of genius are affected with the deficiencies\nentailed in the neglect of this latter kind of knowledge. Yet what I say\nin this regard is subject to the limitation that it only concerns them in\nso far as and while they are actually engaged in that kind of knowledge\nwhich is peculiar to genius; and this is by no means at every moment of\ntheir lives, for the great though spontaneous exertion which is demanded\nfor the comprehension of Ideas free from will must necessarily relax, and\nthere are long intervals during which men of genius are placed in very\nmuch the same position as ordinary mortals, both as regards advantages and\ndeficiencies. On this account the action of genius has always been\nregarded as an inspiration, as indeed the name indicates, as the action of\na superhuman being distinct from the individual himself, and which takes\npossession of him only periodically. The disinclination of men of genius\nto direct their attention to the content of the principle of sufficient\nreason will first show itself, with regard to the ground of being, as\ndislike of mathematics; for its procedure is based upon the most universal\nforms of the phenomenon space and time, which are themselves merely modes\nof the principle of sufficient reason, and is consequently precisely the\nopposite of that method of thought which seeks merely the content of the\nphenomenon, the Idea which expresses itself in it apart from all\nrelations. The logical method of mathematics is also antagonistic to\ngenius, for it does not satisfy but obstructs true insight, and presents\nmerely a chain of conclusions in accordance with the principle of the\nground of knowing. The mental faculty upon which it makes the greatest\nclaim is memory, for it is necessary to recollect all the earlier\npropositions which are referred to. Experience has also proved that men of\ngreat artistic genius have no faculty for mathematics; no man was ever\nvery distinguished for both. Alfieri relates that he was never able to\nunderstand the fourth proposition of Euclid. Goethe was constantly\nreproached with his want of mathematical knowledge by the ignorant\nopponents of his theory of colours. Here certainly, where it was not a\nquestion of calculation and measurement upon hypothetical data, but of\ndirect knowledge by the understanding of causes and effects, this reproach\nwas so utterly absurd and inappropriate, that by making it they have\nexposed their entire want of judgment, just as much as by the rest of\ntheir ridiculous arguments. The fact that up to the present day, nearly\nhalf a century after the appearance of Goethe’s theory of colours, even in\nGermany the Newtonian fallacies still have undisturbed possession of the\nprofessorial chair, and men continue to speak quite seriously of the seven\nhomogeneous rays of light and their different refrangibility, will some\nday be numbered among the great intellectual peculiarities of men\ngenerally, and especially of Germans. From the same cause as we have\nreferred to above, may be explained the equally well-known fact that,\nconversely, admirable mathematicians have very little susceptibility for\nworks of fine art. This is very naïvely expressed in the well-known\nanecdote of the French mathematician, who, after having read Racine’s\n“Iphigenia,” shrugged his shoulders and asked, “_Qu’est ce que cela\nprouve?_” Further, as quick comprehension of relations in accordance with\nthe laws of causality and motivation is what specially constitutes\nprudence or sagacity, a prudent man, so far as and while he is so, will\nnot be a genius, and a man of genius, so far as and while he is so, will\nnot be a prudent man. Lastly, perceptive knowledge generally, in the\nprovince of which the Idea always lies, is directly opposed to rational or\nabstract knowledge, which is guided by the principle of the ground of\nknowing. It is also well known that we seldom find great genius united\nwith pre-eminent reasonableness; on the contrary, persons of genius are\noften subject to violent emotions and irrational passions. But the ground\nof this is not weakness of reason, but partly unwonted energy of that\nwhole phenomenon of will—the man of genius—which expresses itself through\nthe violence of all his acts of will, and partly preponderance of the\nknowledge of perception through the senses and understanding over abstract\nknowledge, producing a decided tendency to the perceptible, the\nexceedingly lively impressions of which so far outshine colourless\nconcepts, that they take their place in the guidance of action, which\nconsequently becomes irrational. Accordingly the impression of the present\nmoment is very strong with such persons, and carries them away into\nunconsidered action, violent emotions and passions. Moreover, since, in\ngeneral, the knowledge of persons of genius has to some extent freed\nitself from the service of will, they will not in conversation think so\nmuch of the person they are addressing as of the thing they are speaking\nabout, which is vividly present to them; and therefore they are likely to\njudge or narrate things too objectively for their own interests; they will\nnot pass over in silence what would more prudently be concealed, and so\nforth. Finally, they are given to soliloquising, and in general may\nexhibit certain weaknesses which are actually akin to madness. It has\noften been remarked that there is a side at which genius and madness\ntouch, and even pass over into each other, and indeed poetical inspiration\nhas been called a kind of madness: _amabilis insania_, Horace calls it\n(Od. iii. 4), and Wieland in the introduction to “Oberon” speaks of it as\n“amiable madness.” Even Aristotle, as quoted by Seneca (De Tranq. Animi,\n15, 16), is reported to have said: _Nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura\ndementiæ fuit_. Plato expresses it in the figure of the dark cave,\nreferred to above (De Rep. 7), when he says: “Those who, outside the cave,\nhave seen the true sunlight and the things that have true being (Ideas),\ncannot afterwards see properly down in the cave, because their eyes are\nnot accustomed to the darkness; they cannot distinguish the shadows, and\nare jeered at for their mistakes by those who have never left the cave and\nits shadows.” In the “Phædrus” also (p. 317), he distinctly says that\nthere can be no true poet without a certain madness; in fact, (p. 327),\nthat every one appears mad who recognises the eternal Ideas in fleeting\nthings. Cicero also quotes: _Negat enim sine furore, Democritus, quemquam\npoetam magnum esse posse; quod idem dicit Plato_ (De Divin., i. 37). And,\nlastly, Pope says—\n\n    “Great wits to madness sure are near allied,\n    And thin partitions do their bounds divide.”\n\nEspecially instructive in this respect is Goethe’s “Torquato Tasso,” in\nwhich he shows us not only the suffering, the martyrdom of genius as such,\nbut also how it constantly passes into madness. Finally, the fact of the\ndirect connection of genius and madness is established by the biographies\nof great men of genius, such as Rousseau, Byron, and Alfieri, and by\nanecdotes from the lives of others. On the other hand, I must mention\nthat, by a diligent search in lunatic asylums, I have found individual\ncases of patients who were unquestionably endowed with great talents, and\nwhose genius distinctly appeared through their madness, which, however,\nhad completely gained the upper hand. Now this cannot be ascribed to\nchance, for on the one hand the number of mad persons is relatively very\nsmall, and on the other hand a person of genius is a phenomenon which is\nrare beyond all ordinary estimation, and only appears in nature as the\ngreatest exception. It will be sufficient to convince us of this if we\ncompare the number of really great men of genius that the whole of\ncivilised Europe has produced, both in ancient and modern times, with the\ntwo hundred and fifty millions who are always living in Europe, and who\nchange entirely every thirty years. In estimating the number of men of\noutstanding genius, we must of course only count those who have produced\nworks which have retained through all time an enduring value for mankind.\nI shall not refrain from mentioning, that I have known some persons of\ndecided, though not remarkable, mental superiority, who also showed a\nslight trace of insanity. It might seem from this that every advance of\nintellect beyond the ordinary measure, as an abnormal development,\ndisposes to madness. In the meantime, however, I will explain as briefly\nas possible my view of the purely intellectual ground of the relation\nbetween genius and madness, for this will certainly assist the explanation\nof the real nature of genius, that is to say, of that mental endowment\nwhich alone can produce genuine works of art. But this necessitates a\nbrief explanation of madness itself.(50)\n\nA clear and complete insight into the nature of madness, a correct and\ndistinct conception of what constitutes the difference between the sane\nand the insane, has, as far as I know, not as yet been found. Neither\nreason nor understanding can be denied to madmen, for they talk and\nunderstand, and often draw very accurate conclusions; they also, as a\nrule, perceive what is present quite correctly, and apprehend the\nconnection between cause and effect. Visions, like the phantasies of\ndelirium, are no ordinary symptom of madness: delirium falsifies\nperception, madness the thoughts. For the most part, madmen do not err in\nthe knowledge of what is immediately _present_; their raving always\nrelates to what is _absent_ and _past_, and only through these to their\nconnection with what is present. Therefore it seems to me that their\nmalady specially concerns the memory; not indeed that memory fails them\nentirely, for many of them know a great deal by heart, and sometimes\nrecognise persons whom they have not seen for a long time; but rather that\nthe thread of memory is broken, the continuity of its connection\ndestroyed, and no uniformly connected recollection of the past is\npossible. Particular scenes of the past are known correctly, just like the\nparticular present; but there are gaps in their recollection which they\nfill up with fictions, and these are either always the same, in which case\nthey become fixed ideas, and the madness that results is called monomania\nor melancholy; or they are always different, momentary fancies, and then\nit is called folly, _fatuitas_. This is why it is so difficult to find out\ntheir former life from lunatics when they enter an asylum. The true and\nthe false are always mixed up in their memory. Although the immediate\npresent is correctly known, it becomes falsified through its fictitious\nconnection with an imaginary past; they therefore regard themselves and\nothers as identical with persons who exist only in their imaginary past;\nthey do not recognise some of their acquaintances at all, and thus while\nthey perceive correctly what is actually present, they have only false\nconceptions of its relations to what is absent. If the madness reaches a\nhigh degree, there is complete absence of memory, so that the madman is\nquite incapable of any reference to what is absent or past, and is only\ndetermined by the caprice of the moment in connection with the fictions\nwhich, in his mind, fill the past. In such a case, we are never for a\nmoment safe from violence or murder, unless we constantly make the madman\naware of the presence of superior force. The knowledge of the madman has\nthis in common with that of the brute, both are confined to the present.\nWhat distinguishes them is that the brute has really no idea of the past\nas such, though the past acts upon it through the medium of custom, so\nthat, for example, the dog recognises its former master even after years,\nthat is to say, it receives the wonted impression at the sight of him; but\nof the time that has passed since it saw him it has no recollection. The\nmadman, on the other hand, always carries about in his reason an abstract\npast, but it is a false past, which exists only for him, and that either\nconstantly, or only for the moment. The influence of this false past\nprevents the use of the true knowledge of the present which the brute is\nable to make. The fact that violent mental suffering or unexpected and\nterrible calamities should often produce madness, I explain in the\nfollowing manner. All such suffering is as an actual event confined to the\npresent. It is thus merely transitory, and is consequently never\nexcessively heavy; it only becomes unendurably great when it is lasting\npain; but as such it exists only in thought, and therefore lies in the\n_memory_. If now such a sorrow, such painful knowledge or reflection, is\nso bitter that it becomes altogether unbearable, and the individual is\nprostrated under it, then, terrified Nature seizes upon _madness_ as the\nlast resource of life; the mind so fearfully tortured at once destroys the\nthread of its memory, fills up the gaps with fictions, and thus seeks\nrefuge in madness from the mental suffering that exceeds its strength,\njust as we cut off a mortified limb and replace it with a wooden one. The\ndistracted Ajax, King Lear, and Ophelia may be taken as examples; for the\ncreations of true genius, to which alone we can refer here, as universally\nknown, are equal in truth to real persons; besides, in this case, frequent\nactual experience shows the same thing. A faint analogy of this kind of\ntransition from pain to madness is to be found in the way in which all of\nus often seek, as it were mechanically, to drive away a painful thought\nthat suddenly occurs to us by some loud exclamation or quick movement—to\nturn ourselves from it, to distract our minds by force.\n\nWe see, from what has been said, that the madman has a true knowledge of\nwhat is actually present, and also of certain particulars of the past, but\nthat he mistakes the connection, the relations, and therefore falls into\nerror and talks nonsense. Now this is exactly the point at which he comes\ninto contact with the man of genius; for he also leaves out of sight the\nknowledge of the connection of things, since he neglects that knowledge of\nrelations which conforms to the principle of sufficient reason, in order\nto see in things only their Ideas, and to seek to comprehend their true\nnature, which manifests itself to perception, and in regard to which _one\nthing_ represents its whole species, in which way, as Goethe says, one\ncase is valid for a thousand. The particular object of his contemplation,\nor the present which is perceived by him with extraordinary vividness,\nappear in so strong a light that the other links of the chain to which\nthey belong are at once thrown into the shade, and this gives rise to\nphenomena which have long been recognised as resembling those of madness.\nThat which in particular given things exists only incompletely and\nweakened by modifications, is raised by the man of genius, through his way\nof contemplating it, to the Idea of the thing, to completeness: he\ntherefore sees everywhere extremes, and therefore his own action tends to\nextremes; he cannot hit the mean, he lacks soberness, and the result is\nwhat we have said. He knows the Ideas completely but not the individuals.\nTherefore it has been said that a poet may know mankind deeply and\nthoroughly, and may yet have a very imperfect knowledge of men. He is\neasily deceived, and is a tool in the hands of the crafty.",

    "page_content": "capacity for knowing, independently of the principle of sufficient reason,\nnot individual things, which have their existence only in their relations,\nbut the Ideas of such things, and of being oneself the correlative of the\nIdea, and thus no longer an individual, but the pure subject of knowledge.\nYet this faculty must exist in all men in a smaller and different degree;\nfor if not, they would be just as incapable of enjoying works of art as of\nproducing them; they would have no susceptibility for the beautiful or the\nsublime; indeed, these words could have no meaning for them. We must\ntherefore assume that there exists in all men this power of knowing the\nIdeas in things, and consequently of transcending their personality for\nthe moment, unless indeed there are some men who are capable of no\næsthetic pleasure at all. The man of genius excels ordinary men only by\npossessing this kind of knowledge in a far higher degree and more\ncontinuously. Thus, while under its influence he retains the presence of\nmind which is necessary to enable him to repeat in a voluntary and\nintentional work what he has learned in this manner; and this repetition\nis the work of art. Through this he communicates to others the Idea he has\ngrasped. This Idea remains unchanged and the same, so that æsthetic\npleasure is one and the same whether it is called forth by a work of art\nor directly by the contemplation of nature and life. The work of art is\nonly a means of facilitating the knowledge in which this pleasure\nconsists. That the Idea comes to us more easily from the work of art than\ndirectly from nature and the real world, arises from the fact that the\nartist, who knew only the Idea, no longer the actual, has reproduced in\nhis work the pure Idea, has abstracted it from the actual, omitting all\ndisturbing accidents. The artist lets us see the world through his eyes.\nThat he has these eyes, that he knows the inner nature of things apart\nfrom all their relations, is the gift of genius, is inborn; but that he is\nable to lend us this gift, to let us see with his eyes, is acquired, and\nis the technical side of art. Therefore, after the account which I have\ngiven in the preceding pages of the inner nature of æsthetical knowledge\nin its most general outlines, the following more exact philosophical\ntreatment of the beautiful and the sublime will explain them both, in\nnature and in art, without separating them further. First of all we shall\nconsider what takes place in a man when he is affected by the beautiful\nand the sublime; whether he derives this emotion directly from nature,\nfrom life, or partakes of it only through the medium of art, does not make\nany essential, but merely an external, difference.",

    "page_content": "inseparable constituent parts_—the knowledge of the object, not as\nindividual thing but as Platonic Idea, that is, as the enduring form of\nthis whole species of things; and the self-consciousness of the knowing\nperson, not as individual, but as _pure will-less subject of knowledge_.\nThe condition under which both these constituent parts appear always\nunited was found to be the abandonment of the method of knowing which is\nbound to the principle of sufficient reason, and which, on the other hand,\nis the only kind of knowledge that is of value for the service of the will\nand also for science. Moreover, we shall see that the pleasure which is\nproduced by the contemplation of the beautiful arises from these two\nconstituent parts, sometimes more from the one, sometimes more from the\nother, according to what the object of the æsthetical contemplation may\nbe.\n\nAll _willing_ arises from want, therefore from deficiency, and therefore\nfrom suffering. The satisfaction of a wish ends it; yet for one wish that\nis satisfied there remain at least ten which are denied. Further, the\ndesire lasts long, the demands are infinite; the satisfaction is short and\nscantily measured out. But even the final satisfaction is itself only\napparent; every satisfied wish at once makes room for a new one; both are\nillusions; the one is known to be so, the other not yet. No attained\nobject of desire can give lasting satisfaction, but merely a fleeting\ngratification; it is like the alms thrown to the beggar, that keeps him\nalive to-day that his misery may be prolonged till the morrow. Therefore,\nso long as our consciousness is filled by our will, so long as we are\ngiven up to the throng of desires with their constant hopes and fears, so\nlong as we are the subject of willing, we can never have lasting happiness\nnor peace. It is essentially all the same whether we pursue or flee, fear\ninjury or seek enjoyment; the care for the constant demands of the will,\nin whatever form it may be, continually occupies and sways the\nconsciousness; but without peace no true well-being is possible. The\nsubject of willing is thus constantly stretched on the revolving wheel of\nIxion, pours water into the sieve of the Danaids, is the ever-longing\nTantalus.\n\nBut when some external cause or inward disposition lifts us suddenly out\nof the endless stream of willing, delivers knowledge from the slavery of\nthe will, the attention is no longer directed to the motives of willing,\nbut comprehends things free from their relation to the will, and thus\nobserves them without personal interest, without subjectivity, purely\nobjectively, gives itself entirely up to them so far as they are ideas,\nbut not in so far as they are motives. Then all at once the peace which we\nwere always seeking, but which always fled from us on the former path of\nthe desires, comes to us of its own accord, and it is well with us. It is\nthe painless state which Epicurus prized as the highest good and as the\nstate of the gods; for we are for the moment set free from the miserable\nstriving of the will; we keep the Sabbath of the penal servitude of\nwilling; the wheel of Ixion stands still.\n\nBut this is just the state which I described above as necessary for the\nknowledge of the Idea, as pure contemplation, as sinking oneself in\nperception, losing oneself in the object, forgetting all individuality,\nsurrendering that kind of knowledge which follows the principle of\nsufficient reason, and comprehends only relations; the state by means of\nwhich at once and inseparably the perceived particular thing is raised to\nthe Idea of its whole species, and the knowing individual to the pure\nsubject of will-less knowledge, and as such they are both taken out of the\nstream of time and all other relations. It is then all one whether we see\nthe sun set from the prison or from the palace.\n\nInward disposition, the predominance of knowing over willing, can produce\nthis state under any circumstances. This is shown by those admirable Dutch\nartists who directed this purely objective perception to the most\ninsignificant objects, and established a lasting monument of their\nobjectivity and spiritual peace in their pictures of _still life_, which\nthe æsthetic beholder does not look on without emotion; for they present\nto him the peaceful, still, frame of mind of the artist, free from will,\nwhich was needed to contemplate such insignificant things so objectively,\nto observe them so attentively, and to repeat this perception so\nintelligently; and as the picture enables the onlooker to participate in\nthis state, his emotion is often increased by the contrast between it and\nthe unquiet frame of mind, disturbed by vehement willing, in which he\nfinds himself. In the same spirit, landscape-painters, and particularly\nRuisdael, have often painted very insignificant country scenes, which\nproduce the same effect even more agreeably.\n\nAll this is accomplished by the inner power of an artistic nature alone;\nbut that purely objective disposition is facilitated and assisted from\nwithout by suitable objects, by the abundance of natural beauty which\ninvites contemplation, and even presses itself upon us. Whenever it\ndiscloses itself suddenly to our view, it almost always succeeds in\ndelivering us, though it may be only for a moment, from subjectivity, from\nthe slavery of the will, and in raising us to the state of pure knowing.\nThis is why the man who is tormented by passion, or want, or care, is so\nsuddenly revived, cheered, and restored by a single free glance into\nnature: the storm of passion, the pressure of desire and fear, and all the\nmiseries of willing are then at once, and in a marvellous manner, calmed\nand appeased. For at the moment at which, freed from the will, we give\nourselves up to pure will-less knowing, we pass into a world from which\neverything is absent that influenced our will and moved us so violently\nthrough it. This freeing of knowledge lifts us as wholly and entirely away\nfrom all that, as do sleep and dreams; happiness and unhappiness have\ndisappeared; we are no longer individual; the individual is forgotten; we\nare only pure subject of knowledge; we are only that _one_ eye of the\nworld which looks out from all knowing creatures, but which can become\nperfectly free from the service of will in man alone. Thus all difference\nof individuality so entirely disappears, that it is all the same whether\nthe perceiving eye belongs to a mighty king or to a wretched beggar; for\nneither joy nor complaining can pass that boundary with us. So near us\nalways lies a sphere in which we escape from all our misery; but who has\nthe strength to continue long in it? As soon as any single relation to our\nwill, to our person, even of these objects of our pure contemplation,\ncomes again into consciousness, the magic is at an end; we fall back into\nthe knowledge which is governed by the principle of sufficient reason; we\nknow no longer the Idea, but the particular thing, the link of a chain to\nwhich we also belong, and we are again abandoned to all our woe. Most men\nremain almost always at this standpoint because they entirely lack\nobjectivity, _i.e._, genius. Therefore they have no pleasure in being\nalone with nature; they need company, or at least a book. For their\nknowledge remains subject to their will; they seek, therefore, in objects,\nonly some relation to their will, and whenever they see anything that has\nno such relation, there sounds within them, like a ground bass in music,\nthe constant inconsolable cry, “It is of no use to me;” thus in solitude\nthe most beautiful surroundings have for them a desolate, dark, strange,\nand hostile appearance.\n\nLastly, it is this blessedness of will-less perception which casts an\nenchanting glamour over the past and distant, and presents them to us in\nso fair a light by means of self-deception. For as we think of days long\ngone by, days in which we lived in a distant place, it is only the objects\nwhich our fancy recalls, not the subject of will, which bore about with it\nthen its incurable sorrows just as it bears them now; but they are\nforgotten, because since then they have often given place to others. Now,\nobjective perception acts with regard to what is remembered just as it\nwould in what is present, if we let it have influence over us, if we\nsurrendered ourselves to it free from will. Hence it arises that,\nespecially when we are more than ordinarily disturbed by some want, the\nremembrance of past and distant scenes suddenly flits across our minds\nlike a lost paradise. The fancy recalls only what was objective, not what\nwas individually subjective, and we imagine that that objective stood\nbefore us then just as pure and undisturbed by any relation to the will as\nits image stands in our fancy now; while in reality the relation of the\nobjects to our will gave us pain then just as it does now. We can deliver\nourselves from all suffering just as well through present objects as\nthrough distant ones whenever we raise ourselves to a purely objective\ncontemplation of them, and so are able to bring about the illusion that\nonly the objects are present and not we ourselves. Then, as the pure\nsubject of knowledge, freed from the miserable self, we become entirely\none with these objects, and, for the moment, our wants are as foreign to\nus as they are to them. The world as idea alone remains, and the world as\nwill has disappeared.\n\nIn all these reflections it has been my object to bring out clearly the\nnature and the scope of the subjective element in æsthetic pleasure; the\ndeliverance of knowledge from the service of the will, the forgetting of\nself as an individual, and the raising of the consciousness to the pure\nwill-less, timeless, subject of knowledge, independent of all relations.\nWith this subjective side of æsthetic contemplation, there must always\nappear as its necessary correlative the objective side, the intuitive\ncomprehension of the Platonic Idea. But before we turn to the closer\nconsideration of this, and to the achievements of art in relation to it,\nit is better that we should pause for a little at the subjective side of\næsthetic pleasure, in order to complete our treatment of this by\nexplaining the impression of the _sublime_ which depends altogether upon\nit, and arises from a modification of it. After that we shall complete our\ninvestigation of æsthetic pleasure by considering its objective side.\n\nBut we must first add the following remarks to what has been said. Light\nis the pleasantest and most gladdening of things; it has become the symbol\nof all that is good and salutary. In all religions it symbolises\nsalvation, while darkness symbolises damnation. Ormuzd dwells in the\npurest light, Ahrimines in eternal night. Dante’s Paradise would look very\nmuch like Vauxhall in London, for all the blessed spirits appear as points\nof light and arrange themselves in regular figures. The very absence of\nlight makes us sad; its return cheers us. Colours excite directly a keen\ndelight, which reaches its highest degree when they are transparent. All\nthis depends entirely upon the fact that light is the correlative and\ncondition of the most perfect kind of knowledge of perception, the only\nknowledge which does not in any way affect the will. For sight, unlike the\naffections of the other senses, cannot, in itself, directly and through\nits sensuous effect, make the _sensation_ of the special organ agreeable\nor disagreeable; that is, it has no immediate connection with the will.\nSuch a quality can only belong to the perception which arises in the\nunderstanding, and then it lies in the relation of the object to the will.\nIn the case of hearing this is to some extent otherwise; sounds can give\npain directly, and they may also be sensuously agreeable, directly and\nwithout regard to harmony or melody. Touch, as one with the feeling of the\nwhole body, is still more subordinated to this direct influence upon the\nwill; and yet there is such a thing as a sensation of touch which is\nneither painful nor pleasant. But smells are always either agreeable or\ndisagreeable, and tastes still more so. Thus the last two senses are most\nclosely related to the will, and therefore they are always the most\nignoble, and have been called by Kant the subjective senses. The pleasure\nwhich we experience from light is in fact only the pleasure which arises\nfrom the objective possibility of the purest and fullest perceptive\nknowledge, and as such it may be traced to the fact that pure knowledge,\nfreed and delivered from all will, is in the highest degree pleasant, and\nof itself constitutes a large part of æsthetic enjoyment. Again, we must\nrefer to this view of light the incredible beauty which we associate with\nthe reflection of objects in water. That lightest, quickest, finest\nspecies of the action of bodies upon each other, that to which we owe by\nfar the completest and purest of our perceptions, the action of reflected\nrays of light, is here brought clearly before our eyes, distinct and\nperfect, in cause and in effect, and indeed in its entirety, hence the\næsthetic delight it gives us, which, in the most important aspect, is\nentirely based on the subjective ground of æsthetic pleasure, and is\ndelight in pure knowing and its method.",

    "page_content": "of æsthetic pleasure; that is to say, that pleasure so far as it consists\nsimply of delight in perceptive knowledge as such, in opposition to will.\nAnd as directly connected with this, there naturally follows the\nexplanation of that disposition or frame of mind which has been called the\nsense of the _sublime_.\n\nWe have already remarked above that the transition to the state of pure\nperception takes place most easily when the objects bend themselves to it,\nthat is, when by their manifold and yet definite and distinct form they\neasily become representatives of their Ideas, in which beauty, in the\nobjective sense, consists. This quality belongs pre-eminently to natural\nbeauty, which thus affords even to the most insensible at least a fleeting\næsthetic satisfaction: indeed it is so remarkable how especially the\nvegetable world invites æsthetic observation, and, as it were, presses\nitself upon it, that one might say, that these advances are connected with\nthe fact that these organisms, unlike the bodies of animals, are not\nthemselves immediate objects of knowledge, and therefore require the\nassistance of a foreign intelligent individual in order to rise out of the\nworld of blind will and enter the world of idea, and that thus they long,\nas it were, for this entrance, that they may attain at least indirectly\nwhat is denied them directly. But I leave this suggestion which I have\nhazarded, and which borders perhaps upon extravagance, entirely undecided,\nfor only a very intimate and devoted consideration of nature can raise or\njustify it.(51) As long as that which raises us from the knowledge of mere\nrelations subject to the will, to æsthetic contemplation, and thereby\nexalts us to the position of the subject of knowledge free from will, is\nthis fittingness of nature, this significance and distinctness of its\nforms, on account of which the Ideas individualised in them readily\npresent themselves to us; so long is it merely _beauty_ that affects us\nand the sense of the _beautiful_ that is excited. But if these very\nobjects whose significant forms invite us to pure contemplation, have a\nhostile relation to the human will in general, as it exhibits itself in\nits objectivity, the human body, if they are opposed to it, so that it is\nmenaced by the irresistible predominance of their power, or sinks into\ninsignificance before their immeasurable greatness; if, nevertheless, the\nbeholder does not direct his attention to this eminently hostile relation\nto his will, but, although perceiving and recognising it, turns\nconsciously away from it, forcibly detaches himself from his will and its\nrelations, and, giving himself up entirely to knowledge, quietly\ncontemplates those very objects that are so terrible to the will,\ncomprehends only their Idea, which is foreign to all relation, so that he\nlingers gladly over its contemplation, and is thereby raised above\nhimself, his person, his will, and all will:—in that case he is filled\nwith the sense of the _sublime_, he is in the state of spiritual\nexaltation, and therefore the object producing such a state is called\n_sublime_. Thus what distinguishes the sense of the sublime from that of\nthe beautiful is this: in the case of the beautiful, pure knowledge has\ngained the upper hand without a struggle, for the beauty of the object,\n_i.e._, that property which facilitates the knowledge of its Idea, has\nremoved from consciousness without resistance, and therefore\nimperceptibly, the will and the knowledge of relations which is subject to\nit, so that what is left is the pure subject of knowledge without even a\nremembrance of will. On the other hand, in the case of the sublime that\nstate of pure knowledge is only attained by a conscious and forcible\nbreaking away from the relations of the same object to the will, which are\nrecognised as unfavourable, by a free and conscious transcending of the\nwill and the knowledge related to it.\n\nThis exaltation must not only be consciously won, but also consciously\nretained, and it is therefore accompanied by a constant remembrance of\nwill; yet not of a single particular volition, such as fear or desire, but\nof human volition in general, so far as it is universally expressed in its\nobjectivity the human body. If a single real act of will were to come into\nconsciousness, through actual personal pressure and danger from the\nobject, then the individual will thus actually influenced would at once\ngain the upper hand, the peace of contemplation would become impossible,\nthe impression of the sublime would be lost, because it yields to the\nanxiety, in which the effort of the individual to right itself has sunk\nevery other thought. A few examples will help very much to elucidate this\ntheory of the æsthetic sublime and remove all doubt with regard to it; at\nthe same time they will bring out the different degrees of this sense of\nthe sublime. It is in the main identical with that of the beautiful, with\npure will-less knowing, and the knowledge, that necessarily accompanies it\nof Ideas out of all relation determined by the principle of sufficient\nreason, and it is distinguished from the sense of the beautiful only by\nthe additional quality that it rises above the known hostile relation of\nthe object contemplated to the will in general. Thus there come to be\nvarious degrees of the sublime, and transitions from the beautiful to the\nsublime, according as this additional quality is strong, bold, urgent,\nnear, or weak, distant, and merely indicated. I think it is more in\nkeeping with the plan of my treatise, first to give examples of these\ntransitions, and of the weaker degrees of the impression of the sublime,\nalthough persons whose æsthetical susceptibility in general is not very\ngreat, and whose imagination is not very lively, will only understand the\nexamples given later of the higher and more distinct grades of that\nimpression; and they should therefore confine themselves to these, and\npass over the examples of the very weak degrees of the sublime that are to\nbe given first.\n\nAs man is at once impetuous and blind striving of will (whose pole or\nfocus lies in the genital organs), and eternal, free, serene subject of\npure knowing (whose pole is the brain); so, corresponding to this\nantithesis, the sun is both the source of _light_, the condition of the\nmost perfect kind of knowledge, and therefore of the most delightful of\nthings—and the source of _warmth_, the first condition of life, _i.e._, of\nall phenomena of will in its higher grades. Therefore, what warmth is for\nthe will, light is for knowledge. Light is the largest gem in the crown of\nbeauty, and has the most marked influence on the knowledge of every\nbeautiful object. Its presence is an indispensable condition of beauty;\nits favourable disposition increases the beauty of the most beautiful.\nArchitectural beauty more than any other object is enhanced by favourable\nlight, though even the most insignificant things become through its\ninfluence most beautiful. If, in the dead of winter, when all nature is\nfrozen and stiff, we see the rays of the setting sun reflected by masses\nof stone, illuminating without warming, and thus favourable only to the\npurest kind of knowledge, not to the will; the contemplation of the\nbeautiful effect of the light upon these masses lifts us, as does all\nbeauty, into a state of pure knowing. But, in this case, a certain\ntranscending of the interests of the will is needed to enable us to rise\ninto the state of pure knowing, because there is a faint recollection of\nthe lack of warmth from these rays, that is, an absence of the principle\nof life; there is a slight challenge to persist in pure knowing, and to\nrefrain from all willing, and therefore it is an example of a transition\nfrom the sense of the beautiful to that of the sublime. It is the faintest\ntrace of the sublime in the beautiful; and beauty itself is indeed present\nonly in a slight degree. The following is almost as weak an example.\n\nLet us imagine ourselves transported to a very lonely place, with unbroken\nhorizon, under a cloudless sky, trees and plants in the perfectly\nmotionless air, no animals, no men, no running water, the deepest silence.\nSuch surroundings are, as it were, a call to seriousness and\ncontemplation, apart from all will and its cravings; but this is just what\nimparts to such a scene of desolate stillness a touch of the sublime. For,\nbecause it affords no object, either favourable or unfavourable, for the\nwill which is constantly in need of striving and attaining, there only\nremains the state of pure contemplation, and whoever is incapable of this,\nis ignominiously abandoned to the vacancy of unoccupied will, and the\nmisery of ennui. So far it is a test of our intellectual worth, of which,\ngenerally speaking, the degree of our power of enduring solitude, or our\nlove of it, is a good criterion. The scene we have sketched affords us,\nthen, an example of the sublime in a low degree, for in it, with the state\nof pure knowing in its peace and all-sufficiency, there is mingled, by way\nof contrast, the recollection of the dependence and poverty of the will\nwhich stands in need of constant action. This is the species of the\nsublime for which the sight of the boundless prairies of the interior of\nNorth America is celebrated.\n\nBut let us suppose such a scene, stripped also of vegetation, and showing\nonly naked rocks; then from the entire absence of that organic life which\nis necessary for existence, the will at once becomes uneasy, the desert\nassumes a terrible aspect, our mood becomes more tragic; the elevation to\nthe sphere of pure knowing takes place with a more decided tearing of\nourselves away from the interests of the will; and because we persist in\ncontinuing in the state of pure knowing, the sense of the sublime\ndistinctly appears.\n\nThe following situation may occasion this feeling in a still higher\ndegree: Nature convulsed by a storm; the sky darkened by black threatening\nthunder-clouds; stupendous, naked, overhanging cliffs, completely shutting\nout the view; rushing, foaming torrents; absolute desert; the wail of the\nwind sweeping through the clefts of the rocks. Our dependence, our strife\nwith hostile nature, our will broken in the conflict, now appears visibly\nbefore our eyes. Yet, so long as the personal pressure does not gain the\nupper hand, but we continue in æsthetic contemplation, the pure subject of\nknowing gazes unshaken and unconcerned through that strife of nature,\nthrough that picture of the broken will, and quietly comprehends the Ideas\neven of those objects which are threatening and terrible to the will. In\nthis contrast lies the sense of the sublime.\n\nBut the impression becomes still stronger, if, when we have before our\neyes, on a large scale, the battle of the raging elements, in such a scene\nwe are prevented from hearing the sound of our own voice by the noise of a\nfalling stream; or, if we are abroad in the storm of tempestuous seas,\nwhere the mountainous waves rise and fall, dash themselves furiously\nagainst steep cliffs, and toss their spray high into the air; the storm\nhowls, the sea boils, the lightning flashes from black clouds, and the\npeals of thunder drown the voice of storm and sea. Then, in the undismayed\nbeholder, the two-fold nature of his consciousness reaches the highest\ndegree of distinctness. He perceives himself, on the one hand, as an\nindividual, as the frail phenomenon of will, which the slightest touch of\nthese forces can utterly destroy, helpless against powerful nature,\ndependent, the victim of chance, a vanishing nothing in the presence of\nstupendous might; and, on the other hand, as the eternal, peaceful,\nknowing subject, the condition of the object, and, therefore, the\nsupporter of this whole world; the terrific strife of nature only his\nidea; the subject itself free and apart from all desires and necessities,\nin the quiet comprehension of the Ideas. This is the complete impression\nof the sublime. Here he obtains a glimpse of a power beyond all comparison\nsuperior to the individual, threatening it with annihilation.\n\nThe impression of the sublime may be produced in quite another way, by\npresenting a mere immensity in space and time; its immeasurable greatness\ndwindles the individual to nothing. Adhering to Kant’s nomenclature and\nhis accurate division, we may call the first kind the dynamical, and the\nsecond the mathematical sublime, although we entirely dissent from his\nexplanation of the inner nature of the impression, and can allow no share\nin it either to moral reflections, or to hypostases from scholastic\nphilosophy.\n\nIf we lose ourselves in the contemplation of the infinite greatness of the\nuniverse in space and time, meditate on the thousands of years that are\npast or to come, or if the heavens at night actually bring before our eyes\ninnumerable worlds and so force upon our consciousness the immensity of\nthe universe, we feel ourselves dwindle to nothing; as individuals, as\nliving bodies, as transient phenomena of will, we feel ourselves pass away\nand vanish into nothing like drops in the ocean. But at once there rises\nagainst this ghost of our own nothingness, against such lying\nimpossibility, the immediate consciousness that all these worlds exist\nonly as our idea, only as modifications of the eternal subject of pure\nknowing, which we find ourselves to be as soon as we forget our\nindividuality, and which is the necessary supporter of all worlds and all\ntimes the condition of their possibility. The vastness of the world which\ndisquieted us before, rests now in us; our dependence upon it is annulled\nby its dependence upon us. All this, however, does not come at once into\nreflection, but shows itself merely as the felt consciousness that in some\nsense or other (which philosophy alone can explain) we are one with the\nworld, and therefore not oppressed, but exalted by its immensity. It is\nthe felt consciousness of this that the Upanishads of the Vedas repeatedly\nexpress in such a multitude of different ways; very admirably in the\nsaying already quoted: _Hæ omnes creaturæ in totum ego sum, et præter me\naliud ens non est_ (Oupnek’hat, vol. i. p. 122.) It is the transcending of\nour own individuality, the sense of the sublime.\n\nWe receive this impression of the mathematical-sublime, quite directly, by\nmeans of a space which is small indeed as compared with the world, but\nwhich has become directly perceptible to us, and affects us with its whole\nextent in all its three dimensions, so as to make our own body seem almost\ninfinitely small. An empty space can never be thus perceived, and\ntherefore never an open space, but only space that is directly perceptible\nin all its dimensions by means of the limits which enclose it; thus for\nexample a very high, vast dome, like that of St. Peter’s at Rome, or St.\nPaul’s in London. The sense of the sublime here arises through the\nconsciousness of the vanishing nothingness of our own body in the presence\nof a vastness which, from another point of view, itself exists only in our\nidea, and of which we are as knowing subject, the supporter. Thus here as\neverywhere it arises from the contrast between the insignificance and\ndependence of ourselves as individuals, as phenomena of will, and the\nconsciousness of ourselves as pure subject of knowing. Even the vault of\nthe starry heaven produces this if it is contemplated without reflection;\nbut just in the same way as the vault of stone, and only by its apparent,\nnot its real extent. Some objects of our perception excite in us the\nfeeling of the sublime because, not only on account of their spatial\nvastness, but also of their great age, that is, their temporal duration,\nwe feel ourselves dwarfed to insignificance in their presence, and yet\nrevel in the pleasure of contemplating them: of this kind are very high\nmountains, the Egyptian pyramids, and colossal ruins of great antiquity.\n\nOur explanation of the sublime applies also to the ethical, to what is\ncalled the sublime character. Such a character arises from this, that the\nwill is not excited by objects which are well calculated to excite it, but\nthat knowledge retains the upper hand in their presence. A man of sublime\ncharacter will accordingly consider men in a purely objective way, and not\nwith reference to the relations which they might have to his will; he\nwill, for example, observe their faults, even their hatred and injustice\nto himself, without being himself excited to hatred; he will behold their\nhappiness without envy; he will recognise their good qualities without\ndesiring any closer relations with them; he will perceive the beauty of\nwomen, but he will not desire them. His personal happiness or unhappiness\nwill not greatly affect him, he will rather be as Hamlet describes\nHoratio:—\n\n            “... for thou hast been,\n    As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;\n    A man that fortune’s buffets and rewards\n    Hast ta’en with equal thanks,” &c. (A. 3. Sc. 2.)\n\nFor in the course of his own life and its misfortunes, he will consider\nless his individual lot than that of humanity in general, and will\ntherefore conduct himself in its regard, rather as knowing than as\nsuffering.",

    "page_content": "be in place here, that the proper opposite of the sublime is something\nwhich would not at the first glance be recognised, as such: _the charming_\nor _attractive_. By this, however, I understand, that which excites the\nwill by presenting to it directly its fulfilment, its satisfaction. We saw\nthat the feeling of the sublime arises from the fact, that something\nentirely unfavourable to the will, becomes the object of pure\ncontemplation, so that such contemplation can only be maintained by\npersistently turning away from the will, and transcending its interests;\nthis constitutes the sublimity of the character. The charming or\nattractive, on the contrary, draws the beholder away from the pure\ncontemplation which is demanded by all apprehension of the beautiful,\nbecause it necessarily excites this will, by objects which directly appeal\nto it, and thus he no longer remains pure subject of knowing, but becomes\nthe needy and dependent subject of will. That every beautiful thing which\nis bright or cheering should be called charming, is the result of a too\ngeneral concept, which arises from a want of accurate discrimination, and\nwhich I must entirely set aside, and indeed condemn. But in the sense of\nthe word which has been given and explained, I find only two species of\nthe charming or attractive in the province of art, and both of them are\nunworthy of it. The one species, a very low one, is found in Dutch\npaintings of still life, when they err by representing articles of food,\nwhich by their deceptive likeness necessarily excite the appetite for the\nthings they represent, and this is just an excitement of the will, which\nputs an end to all æsthetic contemplation of the object. Painted fruit is\nyet admissible, because we may regard it as the further development of the\nflower, and as a beautiful product of nature in form and colour, without\nbeing obliged to think of it as eatable; but unfortunately we often find,\nrepresented with deceptive naturalness, prepared and served dishes,\noysters, herrings, crabs, bread and butter, beer, wine, and so forth,\nwhich is altogether to be condemned. In historical painting and in\nsculpture the charming consists in naked figures, whose position, drapery,\nand general treatment are calculated to excite the passions of the\nbeholder, and thus pure æsthetical contemplation is at once annihilated,\nand the aim of art is defeated. This mistake corresponds exactly to that\nwhich we have just censured in the Dutch paintings. The ancients are\nalmost always free from this fault in their representations of beauty and\ncomplete nakedness of form, because the artist himself created them in a\npurely objective spirit, filled with ideal beauty, not in the spirit of\nsubjective, and base sensuality. The charming is thus everywhere to be\navoided in art.\n\nThere is also a negative species of the charming or exciting which is even\nmore reprehensible than the positive form which has been discussed; this\nis the disgusting or the loathsome. It arouses the will of the beholder,\njust as what is properly speaking charming, and therefore disturbs pure\næsthetic contemplation. But it is an active aversion and opposition which\nis excited by it; it arouses the will by presenting to it objects which it\nabhors. Therefore it has always been recognised that it is altogether\ninadmissible in art, where even what is ugly, when it is not disgusting,\nis allowable in its proper place, as we shall see later.",

    "page_content": "point the treatment of the sublime, though we have only half done with the\nbeautiful, as we have considered its subjective side only. For it was\nmerely a special modification of this subjective side that distinguished\nthe beautiful from the sublime. This difference was found to depend upon\nwhether the state of pure will-less knowing, which is presupposed and\ndemanded by all æsthetic contemplation, was reached without opposition, by\nthe mere disappearance of the will from consciousness, because the object\ninvited and drew us towards it; or whether it was only attained through\nthe free, conscious transcending of the will, to which the object\ncontemplated had an unfavourable and even hostile relation, which would\ndestroy contemplation altogether, if we were to give ourselves up to it.\nThis is the distinction between the beautiful and the sublime. In the\nobject they are not essentially different, for in every case the object of\næsthetical contemplation is not the individual thing, but the Idea in it\nwhich is striving to reveal itself; that is to say, adequate objectivity\nof will at a particular grade. Its necessary correlative, independent,\nlike itself of the principle of sufficient reason, is the pure subject of\nknowing; just as the correlative of the particular thing is the knowing\nindividual, both of which lie within the province of the principle of\nsufficient reason.\n\nWhen we say that a thing is _beautiful_, we thereby assert that it is an\nobject of our æsthetic contemplation, and this has a double meaning; on\nthe one hand it means that the sight of the thing makes us _objective_,\nthat is to say, that in contemplating it we are no longer conscious of\nourselves as individuals, but as pure will-less subjects of knowledge; and\non the other hand it means that we recognise in the object, not the\nparticular thing, but an Idea; and this can only happen, so far as our\ncontemplation of it is not subordinated to the principle of sufficient\nreason, does not follow the relation of the object to anything outside it\n(which is always ultimately connected with relations to our own will), but\nrests in the object itself. For the Idea and the pure subject of knowledge\nalways appear at once in consciousness as necessary correlatives, and on\ntheir appearance all distinction of time vanishes, for they are both\nentirely foreign to the principle of sufficient reason in all its forms,\nand lie outside the relations which are imposed by it; they may be\ncompared to the rainbow and the sun, which have no part in the constant\nmovement and succession of the falling drops. Therefore, if, for example,\nI contemplate a tree æsthetically, _i.e._, with artistic eyes, and thus\nrecognise, not it, but its Idea, it becomes at once of no consequence\nwhether it is this tree or its predecessor which flourished a thousand\nyears ago, and whether the observer is this individual or any other that\nlived anywhere and at any time; the particular thing and the knowing\nindividual are abolished with the principle of sufficient reason, and\nthere remains nothing but the Idea and the pure subject of knowing, which\ntogether constitute the adequate objectivity of will at this grade. And\nthe Idea dispenses not only with time, but also with space, for the Idea\nproper is not this special form which appears before me but its\nexpression, its pure significance, its inner being, which discloses itself\nto me and appeals to me, and which may be quite the same though the\nspatial relations of its form be very different.\n\nSince, on the one hand, every given thing may be observed in a. purely\nobjective manner and apart from all relations; and since, on the other\nhand, the will manifests itself in everything at some grade of its\nobjectivity, so that everything is the expression of an Idea; it follows\nthat everything is also _beautiful_. That even the most insignificant\nthings admit of pure objective and will-less contemplation, and thus prove\nthat they are beautiful, is shown by what was said above in this reference\nabout the Dutch pictures of still-life (§ 38). But one thing is more\nbeautiful than another, because it makes this pure objective contemplation\neasier, it lends itself to it, and, so to speak, even compels it, and then\nwe call it very beautiful. This is the case sometimes because, as an\nindividual thing, it expresses in its purity the Idea of its species by\nthe very distinct, clearly defined, and significant relation of its parts,\nand also fully reveals that Idea through the completeness of all the\npossible expressions of its species united in it, so that it makes the\ntransition from the individual thing to the Idea, and therefore also the\ncondition of pure contemplation, very easy for the beholder. Sometimes\nthis possession of special beauty in an object lies in the fact that the\nIdea itself which appeals to us in it is a high grade of the objectivity\nof will, and therefore very significant and expressive. Therefore it is\nthat man is more beautiful than all other objects, and the revelation of\nhis nature is the highest aim of art. Human form and expression are the\nmost important objects of plastic art, and human action the most important\nobject of poetry. Yet each thing has its own peculiar beauty, not only\nevery organism which expresses itself in the unity of an individual being,\nbut also everything unorganised and formless, and even every manufactured\narticle. For all these reveal the Ideas through which the will objectifies\nitself at its lowest grades, they give, as it were, the deepest resounding\nbass-notes of nature. Gravity, rigidity, fluidity, light, and so forth,\nare the Ideas which express themselves in rocks, in buildings, in waters.\nLandscape-gardening or architecture can do no more than assist them to\nunfold their qualities distinctly, fully, and variously; they can only\ngive them the opportunity of expressing themselves purely, so that they\nlend themselves to æsthetic contemplation and make it easier. Inferior\nbuildings or ill-favoured localities, on the contrary, which nature has\nneglected or art has spoiled, perform this task in a very slight degree or\nnot at all; yet even from them these universal, fundamental Ideas of\nnature cannot altogether disappear. To the careful observer they present\nthemselves here also, and even bad buildings and the like are capable of\nbeing æsthetically considered; the Ideas of the most universal properties\nof their materials are still recognisable in them, only the artificial\nform which has been given them does not assist but hinders æsthetic\ncontemplation. Manufactured articles also serve to express Ideas, only it\nis not the Idea of the manufactured article which speaks in them, but the\nIdea of the material to which this artificial form has been given. This\nmay be very conveniently expressed in two words, in the language of the\nschoolmen, thus,—the manufactured article expresses the Idea of its _forma\nsubstantialis_, but not that of its _forma accidentalis_; the latter leads\nto no Idea, but only to a human conception of which it is the result. It\nis needless to say that by manufactured article no work of plastic art is\nmeant. The schoolmen understand, in fact, by _forma substantialis_ that\nwhich I call the grade of the objectification of will in a thing. We shall\nreturn immediately, when we treat of architecture, to the Idea of the\nmaterial. Our view, then, cannot be reconciled with that of Plato if he is\nof opinion that a table or a chair express the Idea of a table or a chair\n(De Rep., x., pp. 284, 285, et Parmen., p. 79, ed. Bip.), but we say that\nthey express the Ideas which are already expressed in their mere material\nas such. According to Aristotle (Metap. xi., chap. 3), however, Plato\nhimself only maintained Ideas of natural objects: ὁ Πλατων εφη, ὁτι ειδη\nεστιν ὁποσα φυσει (_Plato dixit, quod ideæ eorum sunt, quæ natura sunt_),\nand in chap. 5 he says that, according to the Platonists, there are no\nIdeas of house and ring. In any case, Plato’s earliest disciples, as\nAlcinous informs us (_Introductio __ in Platonicam Philosophiam_, chap.\n9), denied that there were any ideas of manufactured articles. He says:\nὉριζονται δε την ιδεαν, παραδειγμα των κατα φυσιν αιωνιον. Ουτε γαρ τοις\nπλειστοις των απο Πλατωνος αρεσκει, των τεχνικων ειναι ιδεας, οἱον ασπιδος\nη λυρας, ουτε μην των παρα φυσιν, οἱον πυρετου και χολερας, ουτε των κατα\nμερος, οἱον Σωκρατους και Πλατωνος, αλλ᾽ ουτε των ευτελων τινος, οἱον\nρυπου και καρφους, ουτε των προς τι, οἱον μειζονος και ὑπερεχοντος; ειναι\nγαρ τας ιδεας νοησεις θεου αιωνιους τε και αυτοτελεις (_Definiunt autem_\nIDEAM _exemplar æternum eorum, quæ secundum naturam existunt. Nam plurimis\nex iis, qui Platonem secuti sunt, minime placuit, arte factorum ideas\nesse, ut clypei atque lyræ; neque rursus eorum, quæ prætor naturam, ut\nfebris et choleræ, neque particularium, ceu Socratis et Platonis; neque\netiam rerum vilium, veluti sordium et festucæ; neque relationum, ut\nmajoris et excedentis: esse namque ideas intellectiones dei æternas, ac\nseipsis perfectas_). We may take this opportunity of mentioning another\npoint in which our doctrine of Ideas differs very much from that of Plato.\nHe teaches (De Rep., x., p. 288) that the object which art tries to\nexpress, the ideal of painting and poetry, is not the Idea but the\nparticular thing. Our whole exposition hitherto has maintained exactly the\nopposite, and Plato’s opinion is the less likely to lead us astray,\ninasmuch as it is the source of one of the greatest and best known errors\nof this great man, his depreciation and rejection of art, and especially\npoetry; he directly connects his false judgment in reference to this with\nthe passage quoted.",

    "page_content": "of the beautiful always supposes at once and inseparably the pure knowing\nsubject and the known Idea as object. Yet the source of æsthetic\nsatisfaction will sometimes lie more in the comprehension of the known\nIdea, sometimes more in the blessedness and spiritual peace of the pure\nknowing subject freed from all willing, and therefore from all\nindividuality, and the pain that proceeds from it. And, indeed, this\npredominance of one or the other constituent part of æsthetic feeling will\ndepend upon whether the intuitively grasped Idea is a higher or a lower\ngrade of the objectivity of will. Thus in æsthetic contemplation (in the\nreal, or through the medium of art) of the beauty of nature in the\ninorganic and vegetable worlds, or in works of architecture, the pleasure\nof pure will-less knowing will predominate, because the Ideas which are\nhere apprehended are only low grades of the objectivity of will, and are\ntherefore not manifestations of deep significance and rich content. On the\nother hand, if animals and man are the objects of æsthetic contemplation\nor representation, the pleasure will consist rather in the comprehension\nof these Ideas, which are the most distinct revelation of will; for they\nexhibit the greatest multiplicity of forms, the greatest richness and deep\nsignificance of phenomena, and reveal to us most completely the nature of\nwill, whether in its violence, its terribleness, its satisfaction or its\naberration (the latter in tragic situations), or finally in its change and\nself-surrender, which is the peculiar theme of christian painting; as the\nIdea of the will enlightened by full knowledge is the object of historical\npainting in general, and of the drama. We shall now go through the fine\narts one by one, and this will give completeness and distinctness to the\ntheory of the beautiful which we have advanced.",

    "page_content": "in the first book, it is throughout nothing but causality: its being\nconsists in its casual action. But causality is a form of the principle of\nsufficient reason; knowledge of the Idea, on the other hand, absolutely\nexcludes the content of that principle. We also found, in the second book,\nthat matter is the common substratum of all particular phenomena of the\nIdeas, and consequently is the connecting link between the Idea and the\nphenomenon, or the particular thing. Accordingly for both of these reasons\nit is impossible that matter can for itself express any Idea. This is\nconfirmed _a posteriori_ by the fact that it is impossible to have a\nperceptible idea of matter as such, but only an abstract conception; in\nthe former, _i.e._, in perceptible ideas are exhibited only the forms and\nqualities of which matter is the supporter, and in all of which Ideas\nreveal themselves. This corresponds also with the fact, that causality\n(the whole essence of matter) cannot for itself be presented perceptibly,\nbut is merely a definite casual connection. On the other hand, _every\nphenomenon_ of an Idea, because as such it has entered the form of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, or the _principium individuationis_, must\nexhibit itself in matter, as one of its qualities. So far then matter is,\nas we have said, the connecting link between the Idea and the _principium\nindividuationis_, which is the form of knowledge of the individual, or the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Plato is therefore perfectly right in his\nenumeration, for after the Idea and the phenomenon, which include all\nother things in the world, he gives matter only, as a third thing which is\ndifferent from both (Timaus, p. 345). The individual, as a phenomenon of\nthe Idea, is always matter. Every quality of matter is also the phenomenon\nof an Idea, and as such it may always be an object of æsthetic\ncontemplation, _i.e._, the Idea expressed in it may always be recognised.\nThis holds good of even the most universal qualities of matter, without\nwhich it never appears, and which are the weakest objectivity of will.\nSuch are gravity, cohesion, rigidity, fluidity, sensitiveness to light,\nand so forth.\n\nIf now we consider _architecture_ simply as a fine art and apart from its\napplication to useful ends, in which it serves the will and not pure\nknowledge, and therefore ceases to be art in our sense; we can assign to\nit no other aim than that of bringing to greater distinctness some of\nthose ideas, which are the lowest grades of the objectivity of will; such\nas gravity, cohesion, rigidity, hardness, those universal qualities of\nstone, those first, simplest, most inarticulate manifestations of will;\nthe bass notes of nature; and after these light, which in many respects is\ntheir opposite. Even at these low grades of the objectivity of will we see\nits nature revealing itself in discord; for properly speaking the conflict\nbetween gravity and rigidity is the sole æsthetic material of\narchitecture; its problem is to make this conflict appear with perfect\ndistinctness in a multitude of different ways. It solves it by depriving\nthese indestructible forces of the shortest way to their satisfaction, and\nconducting them to it by a circuitous route, so that the conflict is\nlengthened and the inexhaustible efforts of both forces become visible in\nmany different ways. The whole mass of the building, if left to its\noriginal tendency, would exhibit a mere heap or clump, bound as closely as\npossible to the earth, to which gravity, the form in which the will\nappears here, continually presses, while rigidity, also objectivity of\nwill, resists. But this very tendency, this effort, is hindered by\narchitecture from obtaining direct satisfaction, and only allowed to reach\nit indirectly and by roundabout ways. The roof, for example, can only\npress the earth through columns, the arch must support itself, and can\nonly satisfy its tendency towards the earth through the medium of the\npillars, and so forth. But just by these enforced digressions, just by\nthese restrictions, the forces which reside in the crude mass of stone\nunfold themselves in the most distinct and multifarious ways; and the\npurely æsthetic aim of architecture can go no further than this. Therefore\nthe beauty, at any rate, of a building lies in the obvious adaptation of\nevery part, not to the outward arbitrary end of man (so far the work\nbelongs to practical architecture), but directly to the stability of the\nwhole, to which the position, dimensions, and form of every part must have\nso necessary a relation that, where it is possible, if any one part were\ntaken away, the whole would fall to pieces. For just because each part\nbears just as much as it conveniently can, and each is supported just\nwhere it requires to be and just to the necessary extent, this opposition\nunfolds itself, this conflict between rigidity and gravity, which\nconstitutes the life, the manifestation of will, in the stone, becomes\ncompletely visible, and these lowest grades of the objectivity of will\nreveal themselves distinctly. In the same way the form of each part must\nnot be determined arbitrarily, but by its end, and its relation to the\nwhole. The column is the simplest form of support, determined simply by\nits end: the twisted column is tasteless; the four-cornered pillar is in\nfact not so simple as the round column, though it happens that it is\neasier to make it. The forms also of frieze, rafter, roof, and dome are\nentirely determined by their immediate end, and explain themselves from\nit. The decoration of capitals, &c., belongs to sculpture, not to\narchitecture, which admits it merely as extraneous ornament, and could\ndispense with it. According to what has been said, it is absolutely\nnecessary, in order to understand the æsthetic satisfaction afforded by a\nwork of architecture, to have immediate knowledge through perception of\nits matter as regards its weight, rigidity, and cohesion, and our pleasure\nin such a work would suddenly be very much diminished by the discovery\nthat the material used was pumice-stone; for then it would appear to us as\na kind of sham building. We would be affected in almost the same way if we\nwere told that it was made of wood, when we had supposed it to be of\nstone, just because this alters and destroys the relation between rigidity\nand gravity, and consequently the significance and necessity of all the\nparts, for these natural forces reveal themselves in a far weaker degree\nin a wooden building. Therefore no real work of architecture as a fine art\ncan be made of wood, although it assumes all forms so easily; this can\nonly be explained by our theory. If we were distinctly told that a\nbuilding, the sight of which gave us pleasure, was made of different kinds\nof material of very unequal weight and consistency, but not\ndistinguishable to the eye, the whole building would become as utterly\nincapable of affording us pleasure as a poem in an unknown language. All\nthis proves that architecture does not affect us mathematically, but also\ndynamically, and that what speaks to us through it, is not mere form and\nsymmetry, but rather those fundamental forces of nature, those first\nIdeas, those lowest grades of the objectivity of will. The regularity of\nthe building and its parts is partly produced by the direct adaptation of\neach member to the stability of the whole, partly it serves to facilitate\nthe survey and comprehension of the whole, and finally, regular figures to\nsome extent enhance the beauty because they reveal the constitution of\nspace as such. But all this is of subordinate value and necessity, and by\nno means the chief concern; indeed, symmetry is not invariably demanded,\nas ruins are still beautiful.\n\nWorks of architecture have further quite a special relation to light; they\ngain a double beauty in the full sunshine, with the blue sky as a\nbackground, and again they have quite a different effect by moonlight.\nTherefore, when a beautiful work of architecture is to be erected, special\nattention is always paid to the effects of the light and to the climate.\nThe reason of all this is, indeed, principally that all the parts and\ntheir relations are only made clearly visible by a bright, strong light;\nbut besides this I am of opinion that it is the function of architecture\nto reveal the nature of light just as it reveals that of things so\nopposite to it as gravity and rigidity. For the light is intercepted,\nconfined, and reflected by the great opaque, sharply outlined, and\nvariously formed masses of stone, and thus it unfolds its nature and\nqualities in the purest and clearest way, to the great pleasure of the\nbeholders, for light is the most joy-giving of things, as the condition\nand the objective correlative of the most perfect kind of knowledge of\nperception.\n\nNow, because the Ideas which architecture brings to clear perception, are\nthe lowest grades of the objectivity of will, and consequently their\nobjective significance, which architecture reveals to us, is comparatively\nsmall; the æsthetic pleasure of looking at a beautiful building in a good\nlight will lie, not so much in the comprehension of the Idea, as in the\nsubjective correlative which accompanies this comprehension; it will\nconsist pre-eminently in the fact that the beholder, set free from the\nkind of knowledge that belongs to the individual, and which serves the\nwill and follows the principle of sufficient reason, is raised to that of\nthe pure subject of knowing free from will. It will consist then\nprincipally in pure contemplation itself, free from all the suffering of\nwill and of individuality. In this respect the opposite of architecture,\nand the other extreme of the series of the fine arts, is the drama, which\nbrings to knowledge the most significant Ideas. Therefore in the æsthetic\npleasure afforded by the drama the objective side is throughout\npredominant.\n\nArchitecture has this distinction from plastic art and poetry: it does not\ngive us a copy but the thing itself. It does not repeat, as they do, the\nknown Idea, so that the artist lends his eyes to the beholder, but in it\nthe artist merely presents the object to the beholder, and facilitates for\nhim the comprehension of the Idea by bringing the actual, individual\nobject to a distinct and complete expression of its nature.\n\nUnlike the works of the other arts, those of architecture are very seldom\nexecuted for purely æsthetic ends. These are generally subordinated to\nother useful ends which are foreign to art itself. Thus the great merit of\nthe architect consists in achieving and attaining the pure æsthetic ends,\nin spite of their subordination to other ends which are foreign to them.\nThis he does by cleverly adapting them in a variety of ways to the\narbitrary ends in view, and by rightly judging which form of æsthetical\narchitectonic beauty is compatible and may be associated with a temple,\nwhich with a palace, which with a prison, and so forth. The more a harsh\nclimate increases these demands of necessity and utility, determines them\ndefinitely, and prescribes them more inevitably, the less free play has\nbeauty in architecture. In the mild climate of India, Egypt, Greece, and\nRome, where the demands of necessity were fewer and less definite,\narchitecture could follow its æsthetic ends with the greatest freedom. But\nunder a northern sky this was sorely hindered. Here, when caissons,\npointed roofs and towers were what was demanded, architecture could only\nunfold its own beauty within very narrow limits, and therefore it was\nobliged to make amends by resorting all the more to the borrowed ornaments\nof sculpture, as is seen in Gothic architecture.\n\nWe thus see that architecture is greatly restricted by the demands of\nnecessity and utility; but on the other hand it has in them a very\npowerful support, for, on account of the magnitude and costliness of its\nworks, and the narrow sphere of its æsthetic effect, it could not continue\nto exist merely as a fine art, if it had not also, as a useful and\nnecessary profession, a firm and honourable place among the occupations of\nmen. It is the want of this that prevents another art from taking its\nplace beside architecture as a sister art, although in an æsthetical point\nof view it is quite properly to be classed along with it as its\ncounterpart; I mean artistic arrangements of water. For what architecture\naccomplishes for the Idea of gravity when it appears in connection with\nthat of rigidity, hydraulics accomplishes for the same Idea, when it is\nconnected with fluidity, _i.e._, formlessness, the greatest mobility and\ntransparency. Leaping waterfalls foaming and tumbling over rocks,\ncataracts dispersed into floating spray, springs gushing up as high\ncolumns of water, and clear reflecting lakes, reveal the Ideas of fluid\nand heavy matter, in precisely the same way as the works of architecture\nunfold the Ideas of rigid matter. Artistic hydraulics, however, obtains no\nsupport from practical hydraulics, for, as a rule, their ends cannot be\ncombined; yet, in exceptional cases, this happens; for example, in the\nCascata di Trevi at Rome.(52)",

    "page_content": "grades of the objectivity of will, is performed for the higher grades of\nvegetable nature by artistic horticulture. The landscape beauty of a scene\nconsists, for the most part, in the multiplicity of natural objects which\nare present in it, and then in the fact that they are clearly separated,\nappear distinctly, and yet exhibit a fitting connection and alternation.\nThese two conditions are assisted and promoted by landscape-gardening, but\nit has by no means such a mastery over its material as architecture, and\ntherefore its effect is limited. The beauty with which it is concerned\nbelongs almost exclusively to nature; it has done little for it; and, on\nthe other hand, it can do little against unfavourable nature, and when\nnature works, not for it, but against it, its achievements are small.\n\nThe vegetable world offers itself everywhere for æsthetic enjoyment\nwithout the medium of art; but so far as it is an object of art, it\nbelongs principally to landscape-painting; to the province of which all\nthe rest of unconscious nature also belongs. In paintings of still life,\nand of mere architecture, ruins, interiors of churches, &c., the\nsubjective side of æsthetic pleasure is predominant, _i.e._, our\nsatisfaction does not lie principally in the direct comprehension of the\nrepresented Ideas, but rather in the subjective correlative of this\ncomprehension, pure, will-less knowing. For, because the painter lets us\nsee these things through his eyes, we at once receive a sympathetic and\nreflected sense of the deep spiritual peace and absolute silence of the\nwill, which were necessary in order to enter with knowledge so entirely\ninto these lifeless objects, and comprehend them with such love, _i.e._,\nin this case with such a degree of objectivity. The effect of\nlandscape-painting proper is indeed, as a whole, of this kind; but because\nthe Ideas expressed are more distinct and significant, as higher grades of\nthe objectivity of will, the objective side of æsthetic pleasure already\ncomes more to the front and assumes as much importance as the subjective\nside. Pure knowing as such is no longer the paramount consideration, for\nwe are equally affected by the known Platonic Idea, the world as idea at\nan important grade of the objectification of will.\n\nBut a far higher grade is revealed by animal painting and sculpture. Of\nthe latter we have some important antique remains; for example, horses at\nVenice, on Monte Cavallo, and on the Elgin Marbles, also at Florence in\nbronze and marble; the ancient boar, howling wolves, the lions in the\narsenal at Venice, also in the Vatican a whole room almost filled with\nancient animals, &c. In these representations the objective side of\næsthetic pleasure obtains a marked predominance over the subjective. The\npeace of the subject which knows these Ideas, which has silenced its own\nwill, is indeed present, as it is in all æsthetic contemplation; but its\neffect is not felt, for we are occupied with the restlessness and\nimpetuosity of the will represented. It is that very will, which\nconstitutes our own nature, that here appears to us in forms, in which its\nmanifestation is not, as in us, controlled and tempered by intellect, but\nexhibits itself in stronger traits, and with a distinctness that borders\non the grotesque and monstrous. For this very reason there is no\nconcealment; it is free, naïve, open as the day, and this is the cause of\nour interest in animals. The characteristics of species appeared already\nin the representation of plants, but showed itself only in the forms; here\nit becomes much more distinct, and expresses itself not only in the form,\nbut in the action, position, and mien, yet always merely as the character\nof the species, not of the individual. This knowledge of the Ideas of\nhigher grades, which in painting we receive through extraneous means, we\nmay gain directly by the pure contemplative perception of plants, and\nobservation of beasts, and indeed of the latter in their free, natural,\nand unrestrained state. The objective contemplation of their manifold and\nmarvellous forms, and of their actions and behaviour, is an instructive\nlesson from the great book of nature, it is a deciphering of the true\n_signatura rerum_.(53) We see in them the manifold grades and modes of the\nmanifestation of will, which in all beings of one and the same grade,\nwills always in the same way, which objectifies itself as life, as\nexistence in such endless variety, and such different forms, which are all\nadaptations to the different external circumstances, and may be compared\nto many variations on the same theme. But if we had to communicate to the\nobserver, for reflection, and in a word, the explanation of their inner\nnature, it would be best to make use of that Sanscrit formula which occurs\nso often in the sacred books of the Hindoos, and is called Mahavakya,\ni.e., the great word: “_Tat twam asi_,” which means, “this living thing\nart thou.”",

    "page_content": "directly and for perception the Idea in which the will reaches the highest\ngrade of its objectification. The objective side of the pleasure afforded\nby the beautiful is here always predominant, and the subjective side has\nretired into the background. It is further to be observed that at the next\ngrade below this, animal painting, the characteristic is entirely one with\nthe beautiful; the most characteristic lion, wolf, horse, sheep, or ox,\nwas always the most beautiful also. The reason of this is that animals\nhave only the character of their species, no individual character. In the\nrepresentation of men the character of the species is separated from that\nof the individual; the former is now called beauty (entirely in the\nobjective sense), but the latter retains the name, character, or\nexpression, and the new difficulty arises of representing both, at once\nand completely, in the same individual.\n\n_Human beauty_ is an objective expression, which means the fullest\nobjectification of will at the highest grade at which it is knowable, the\nIdea of man in general, completely expressed in the sensible form. But\nhowever much the objective side of the beautiful appears here, the\nsubjective side still always accompanies it. And just because no object\ntransports us so quickly into pure æsthetic contemplation, as the most\nbeautiful human countenance and form, at the sight of which we are\ninstantly filled with unspeakable satisfaction, and raised above ourselves\nand all that troubles us; this is only possible because this most distinct\nand purest knowledge of will raises us most easily and quickly to the\nstate of pure knowing, in which our personality, our will with its\nconstant pain, disappears, so long as the pure æsthetic pleasure lasts.\nTherefore it is that Goethe says: “No evil can touch him who looks on\nhuman beauty; he feels himself at one with himself and with the world.”\nThat a beautiful human form is produced by nature must be explained in\nthis way. At this its highest grade the will objectifies itself in an\nindividual; and therefore through circumstances and its own power it\ncompletely overcomes all the hindrances and opposition which the phenomena\nof the lower grades present to it. Such are the forces of nature, from\nwhich the will must always first extort and win back the matter that\nbelongs to all its manifestations. Further, the phenomenon of will at its\nhigher grades always has multiplicity in its form. Even the tree is only a\nsystematic aggregate of innumerably repeated sprouting fibres. This\ncombination assumes greater complexity in higher forms, and the human body\nis an exceedingly complex system of different parts, each of which has a\npeculiar life of its own, _vita propria_, subordinate to the whole. Now\nthat all these parts are in the proper fashion subordinate to the whole,\nand co-ordinate to each other, that they all work together harmoniously\nfor the expression of the whole, nothing superfluous, nothing restricted;\nall these are the rare conditions, whose result is beauty, the completely\nexpressed character of the species. So is it in nature. But how in art?\nOne would suppose that art achieved the beautiful by imitating nature. But\nhow is the artist to recognise the perfect work which is to be imitated,\nand distinguish it from the failures, if he does not anticipate the\nbeautiful _before experience_? And besides this, has nature ever produced\na human being perfectly beautiful in all his parts? It has accordingly\nbeen thought that the artist must seek out the beautiful parts,\ndistributed among a number of different human beings, and out of them\nconstruct a beautiful whole; a perverse and foolish opinion. For it will\nbe asked, how is he to know that just these forms and not others are\nbeautiful? We also see what kind of success attended the efforts of the\nold German painters to achieve the beautiful by imitating nature. Observe\ntheir naked figures. No knowledge of the beautiful is possible purely _a\nposteriori_, and from mere experience; it is always, at least in part, _a\npriori_, although quite different in kind, from the forms of the principle\nof sufficient reason, of which we are conscious _a priori_. These concern\nthe universal form of phenomena as such, as it constitutes the possibility\nof knowledge in general, the universal _how_ of all phenomena, and from\nthis knowledge proceed mathematics and pure natural science. But this\nother kind of knowledge _a priori_, which makes it possible to express the\nbeautiful, concerns, not the form but the content of phenomena, not the\n_how_ but the _what_ of the phenomenon. That we all recognise human beauty\nwhen we see it, but that in the true artist this takes place with such\nclearness that he shows it as he has never seen it, and surpasses nature\nin his representation; this is only possible because _we ourselves are_\nthe will whose adequate objectification at its highest grade is here to be\njudged and discovered. Thus alone have we in fact an anticipation of that\nwhich nature (which is just the will that constitutes our own being)\nstrives to express. And in the true genius this anticipation is\naccompanied by so great a degree of intelligence that he recognises the\nIdea in the particular thing, and thus, as it were, _understands the\nhalf-uttered speech of nature_, and articulates clearly what she only\nstammered forth. He expresses in the hard marble that beauty of form which\nin a thousand attempts she failed to produce, he presents it to nature,\nsaying, as it were, to her, “That is what you wanted to say!” And whoever\nis able to judge replies, “Yes, that is it.” Only in this way was it\npossible for the genius of the Greeks to find the type of human beauty and\nestablish it as a canon for the school of sculpture; and only by virtue of\nsuch an anticipation is it possible for all of us to recognise beauty,\nwhen it has actually been achieved by nature in the particular case. This\nanticipation is the _Ideal_. It is the _Idea_ so far as it is known _a\npriori_, at least half, and it becomes practical for art, because it\ncorresponds to and completes what is given _a posteriori_ through nature.\nThe possibility of such an anticipation of the beautiful _a priori_ in the\nartist, and of its recognition _a posteriori_ by the critic, lies in the\nfact that the artist and the critic are themselves the “in-itself” of\nnature, the will which objectifies itself. For, as Empedocles said, like\ncan only be known by like: only nature can understand itself: only nature\ncan fathom itself: but only spirit also can understand spirit.(54)\n\nThe opinion, which is absurd, although expressed by the Socrates of\nXenophon (Stobæi Floril, vol. ii. p. 384) that the Greeks discovered the\nestablished ideal of human beauty empirically, by collecting particular\nbeautiful parts, uncovering and noting here a knee, there an arm, has an\nexact parallel in the art of poetry. The view is entertained, that\nShakespeare, for example, observed, and then gave forth from his own\nexperience of life, the innumerable variety of the characters in his\ndramas, so true, so sustained, so profoundly worked out. The impossibility\nand absurdity of such an assumption need not be dwelt upon. It is obvious\nthat the man of genius produces the works of poetic art by means of an\nanticipation of what is characteristic, just as he produces the works of\nplastic and pictorial art by means of a prophetic anticipation of the\nbeautiful; yet both require experience as a pattern or model, for thus\nalone can that which is dimly known _a priori_ be called into clear\nconsciousness, and an intelligent representation of it becomes possible.\n\nHuman beauty was explained above as the fullest objectification of will at\nthe highest grade at which it is knowable. It expresses itself through the\nform; and this lies in space alone, and has no necessary connection with\ntime, as, for example, motion has. Thus far then we may say: the adequate\nobjectification of will through a merely spatial phenomenon is beauty, in\nthe objective sense. A plant is nothing but such a merely spatial\nphenomenon of will; for no motion, and consequently no relation to time\n(regarded apart from its development), belongs to the expression of its\nnature; its mere form expresses its whole being and displays it openly.\nBut brutes and men require, further, for the full revelation of the will\nwhich is manifested in them, a series of actions, and thus the\nmanifestation in them takes on a direct relation to time. All this has\nalready been explained in the preceding book; it is related to what we are\nconsidering at present in the following way. As the merely spatial\nmanifestation of will can objectify it fully or defectively at each\ndefinite grade,—and it is this which constitutes beauty or ugliness,—so\nthe temporal objectification of will, _i.e._, the action, and indeed the\ndirect action, the movement, may correspond to the will, which objectifies\nitself in it, purely and fully without foreign admixture, without\nsuperfluity, without defect, only expressing exactly the act of will\ndetermined in each case;—or the converse of all this may occur. In the\nfirst case the movement is made with _grace_, in the second case without\nit. Thus as beauty is the adequate representation of will generally,\nthrough its merely spatial manifestation; _grace_ is the adequate\nrepresentation of will through its temporal manifestation, that is to say,\nthe perfectly accurate and fitting expression of each act of will, through\nthe movement and position which objectify it. Since movement and position\npresuppose the body, Winckelmann’s expression is very true and suitable,\nwhen he says, “Grace is the proper relation of the acting person to the\naction” (Works, vol. i. p. 258). It is thus evident that beauty may be\nattributed to a plant, but no grace, unless in a figurative sense; but to\nbrutes and men, both beauty and grace. Grace consists, according to what\nhas been said, in every movement being performed, and every position\nassumed, in the easiest, most appropriate and convenient way, and\ntherefore being the pure, adequate expression of its intention, or of the\nact of will, without any superfluity, which exhibits itself as aimless,\nmeaningless bustle, or as wooden stiffness. Grace presupposes as its\ncondition a true proportion of all the limbs, and a symmetrical,\nharmonious figure; for complete ease and evident appropriateness of all\npositions and movements are only possible by means of these. Grace is\ntherefore never without a certain degree of beauty of person. The two,\ncomplete and united, are the most distinct manifestation of will at the\nhighest grade of its objectification.\n\nIt was mentioned above that in order rightly to portray man, it is\nnecessary to separate the character of the species from that of the\nindividual, so that to a certain extent every man expresses an Idea\npeculiar to himself, as was said in the last book. Therefore the arts\nwhose aim is the representation of the Idea of man, have as their problem,\nnot only beauty, the character of the species, but also the character of\nthe individual, which is called, _par excellence_, _character_. But this\nis only the case in so far as this character is to be regarded, not as\nsomething accidental and quite peculiar to the man as a single individual,\nbut as a side of the Idea of humanity which is specially apparent in this\nindividual, and the representation of which is therefore of assistance in\nrevealing this Idea. Thus the character, although as such it is\nindividual, must yet be Ideal, that is, its significance in relation to\nthe Idea of humanity generally (the objectifying of which it assists in\nits own way) must be comprehended and expressed with special prominence.\nApart from this the representation is a portrait, a copy of the individual\nas such, with all his accidental qualities. And even the portrait ought to\nbe, as Winckelmann says, the ideal of the individual.\n\nThat _character_ which is to be ideally comprehended, as the prominence of\na special side of the Idea of humanity, expresses itself visibly, partly\nthrough permanent physiognomy and bodily form, partly through passing\nemotion and passion, the reciprocal modification of knowing and willing by\neach other, which is all exhibited in the mien and movements. Since the\nindividual always belongs to humanity, and, on the other hand, humanity\nalways reveals itself in the individual with what is indeed peculiar ideal\nsignificance, beauty must not be destroyed by character nor character by\nbeauty. For if the character of the species is annulled by that of the\nindividual, the result is caricature; and if the character of the\nindividual is annulled by that of the species, the result is an absence of\nmeaning. Therefore the representation which aims at beauty, as sculpture\nprincipally does, will yet always modify this (the character of the\nspecies), in some respect, by the individual character, and will always\nexpress the Idea of man in a definite individual manner, giving prominence\nto a special side of it. For the human individual as such has to a certain\nextent the dignity of a special Idea, and it is essential to the Idea of\nman that it should express itself in individuals of special significance.\nTherefore we find in the works of the ancients, that the beauty distinctly\ncomprehended by them, is not expressed in one form, but in many forms of\ndifferent character. It is always apprehended, as it were, from a\ndifferent side, and expressed in one way in Apollo, in another way in\nBacchus, in another in Hercules, in another in Antinous; indeed the\ncharacteristic may limit the beautiful, and finally extend even to\nhideousness, in the drunken Silenus, in the Faun, &c. If the\ncharacteristic goes so far as actually to annul the character of the\nspecies, if it extends to the unnatural, it becomes caricature. But we can\nfar less afford to allow grace to be interfered with by what is\ncharacteristic than even beauty, for graceful position and movement are\ndemanded for the expression of the character also; but yet it must be\nachieved in the way which is most fitting, appropriate, and easy for the\nperson. This will be observed, not only by the sculptor and the painter,\nbut also by every good actor; otherwise caricature will appear here also\nas grimace or distortion.\n\nIn sculpture, beauty and grace are the principal concern. The special\ncharacter of the mind, appearing in emotion, passion, alternations of\nknowing and willing, which can only be represented by the expression of\nthe countenance and the gestures, is the peculiar sphere of _painting_.\nFor although eyes and colour, which lie outside the province of sculpture,\ncontribute much to beauty, they are yet far more essential to character.\nFurther, beauty unfolds itself more completely when it is contemplated\nfrom various points of view; but the expression, the character, can only\nbe completely comprehended from _one_ point of view.\n\nBecause beauty is obviously the chief aim of sculpture, Lessing tried to\nexplain the fact that the _Laocoon does not cry out_, by saying that\ncrying out is incompatible with beauty. The Laocoon formed for Lessing the\ntheme, or at least the text of a work of his own, and both before and\nafter him a great deal has been written on the subject. I may therefore be\nallowed to express my views about it in passing, although so special a\ndiscussion does not properly belong to the scheme of this work, which is\nthroughout concerned with what is general.",

    "page_content": "and the universal and ever-renewed surprise at this must be occasioned by\nthe fact that any of us would cry out if we were in his place. And nature\ndemands that it should be so; for in the case of the acutest physical\npain, and the sudden seizure by the greatest bodily fear, all reflection,\nthat might have inculcated silent endurance, is entirely expelled from\nconsciousness, and nature relieves itself by crying out, thus expressing\nboth the pain and the fear, summoning the deliverer and terrifying the\nassailer. Thus Winckelmann missed the expression of crying out; but as he\nwished to justify the artist he turned Laocoon into a Stoic, who\nconsidered it beneath his dignity to cry out _secundum naturam_, but added\nto his pain the useless constraint of suppressing all utterance of it.\nWinckelmann therefore sees in him “the tried spirit of a great man, who\nwrithes in agony, and yet seeks to suppress the utterance of his feeling,\nand to lock it up in himself. He does not break forth into loud cries, as\nin Virgil, but only anxious sighs escape him,” &c. (Works, vol. vii. p.\n98, and at greater length in vol. vi. p. 104). Now Lessing criticised this\nopinion of Winckelmann’s in his Laocoon, and improved it in the way\nmentioned above. In place of the psychological he gave the purely æsthetic\nreason that beauty, the principle of ancient art, does not admit of the\nexpression of crying out. Another argument which he added to this, that a\nmerely passing state incapable of duration ought not to be represented in\nmotionless works of art, has a hundred examples of most excellent figures\nagainst it, which are fixed in merely transitory movements, dancing,\nwrestling, catching, &c. Indeed Goethe, in the essay on the Laocoon, which\nopens the Propylaen (p. 8), holds that the choice of such a merely\nfleeting movement is absolutely necessary. In our own day Hirt (Horen,\n1797, tenth St.) finally decided the point, deducing everything from the\nhighest truth of expression, that Laocoon does not cry out, because he can\nno longer do so, as he is at the point of death from choking. Lastly,\nFernow (“Römische Studien,” vol. i. p. 246) expounded and weighed all\nthese opinions; he added, however, no new one of his own, but combined\nthese three eclectically.\n\nI cannot but wonder that such thoughtful and acute men should laboriously\nbring far-fetched and insufficient reasons, should resort to psychological\nand physiological arguments, to explain a matter the reason of which lies\nso near at hand, and is obvious at once to the unprejudiced; and\nespecially I wonder that Lessing, who came so near the true explanation,\nshould yet have entirely missed the real point.\n\nBefore all psychological and physiological inquiries as to whether Laocoon\nwould cry out in his position or not (and I certainly affirm that he\nwould), it must be decided as regards the group in question, that crying\nout ought not to be expressed in it, for the simple reason that its\nexpression lies quite outside the province of sculpture. A shrieking\nLaocoon could not be produced in marble, but only a figure with the mouth\nopen vainly endeavouring to shriek; a Laocoon whose voice has stuck in his\nthroat, _vox faucibus haesit_. The essence of shrieking, and consequently\nits effect upon the onlooker, lies entirely in sound; not in the\ndistortion of the mouth. This phenomenon, which necessarily accompanies\nshrieking, derives motive and justification only from the sound produced\nby means of it; then it is permissible and indeed necessary, as\ncharacteristic of the action, even though it interferes with beauty. But\nin plastic art, to which the representation of shrieking is quite foreign\nand impossible, it would be actual folly to represent the medium of\nviolent shrieking, the distorted mouth, which would disturb all the\nfeatures and the remainder of the expression; for thus at the sacrifice of\nmany other things the means would be represented, while its end, the\nshrieking itself, and its effect upon our feelings, would be left out. Nay\nmore, there would be produced the spectacle of a continuous effort without\neffect, which is always ridiculous, and may really be compared to what\nhappened when some one for a joke stopped the horn of a night watchman\nwith wax while he was asleep, and then awoke him with the cry of fire, and\namused himself by watching his vain endeavours to blow the horn. When, on\nthe other hand, the expression of shrieking lies in the province of poetic\nor histrionic art, it is quite admissible, because it helps to express the\ntruth, _i.e._, the complete expression of the Idea. Thus it is with\npoetry, which claims the assistance of the imagination of the reader, in\norder to enable it to represent things perceptibly. Therefore Virgil makes\nLaocoon cry out like the bellowing of an ox that has broken loose after\nbeing struck by the axe; and Homer (Il. xx. 48-53) makes Mars and Minerva\nshriek horribly, without derogating from their divine dignity or beauty.\nThe same with acting; Laocoon on the stage would certainly have to shriek.\nSophocles makes Philoctetus cry out, and, on the ancient stage at any\nrate, he must actually have done so. As a case in point, I remember having\nseen in London the great actor Kemble play in a piece called Pizarro,\ntranslated from the German. He took the part of the American, a\nhalf-savage, but of very noble character. When he was wounded he cried out\nloudly and wildly, which had a great and admirable effect, for it was\nexceedingly characteristic and therefore assisted the truth of the\nrepresentation very much. On the other hand, a painted or sculptured model\nof a man shrieking, would be much more absurd than the painted music which\nis censured in Goethe’s Propylaen. For shrieking does far more injury to\nthe expression and beauty of the whole than music, which at the most only\noccupies the hands and arms, and is to be looked upon as an occupation\ncharacteristic of the person; indeed thus far it may quite rightly be\npainted, as long as it demands no violent movement of the body, or\ndistortion of the mouth: for example, St. Cecilia at the organ, Raphael’s\nviolin-player in the Sciarra Gallery at Rome, and others. Since then, on\naccount of the limits of the art, the pain of Laocoon must not be\nexpressed by shrieking, the artist was obliged to employ every other\nexpression of pain; this he has done in the most perfect manner, as is\nably described by Winckelmann (Works, vol. vi. p. 104), whose admirable\naccount thus retains its full value and truth, as soon as we abstract from\nthe stoical view which underlies it.(55)",

Thus to a certain extent drapery is in sculpture what\nfore-shortening is in painting.

It is this: as the beautiful\nbodily form is seen to the greatest advantage when clothed in the lightest\nway, or indeed without any clothing at all, and therefore a very handsome\nman, if he had also taste and the courage to follow it, would go about\nalmost naked, clothed only after the manner of the ancients; so every one\nwho possesses a beautiful and rich mind will always express himself in the\nmost natural, direct, and simple way, concerned, if it be possible, to\ncommunicate his thoughts to others, and thus relieve the loneliness that\nhe must feel in such a world as this. And conversely, poverty of mind,\nconfusion, and perversity of thought, will clothe itself in the most\nfar-fetched expressions and the obscurest forms of speech, in order to\nwrap up in difficult and pompous phraseology small, trifling, insipid, or\ncommonplace thoughts; like a man who has lost the majesty of beauty, and\ntrying to make up for the deficiency by means of clothing, seeks to hide\nthe insignificance or ugliness of his person under barbaric finery,\ntinsel, feathers, ruffles, cuffs, and mantles. Many an author, if\ncompelled to translate his pompous and obscure book into its little clear\ncontent, would be as utterly spoilt as this man if he had to go naked.",

By character we mean generally, the representation\nof will at the highest grade of its objectification, when the individual,\nas giving prominence to a particular side of the Idea of humanity, has\nspecial significance, and shows this not merely by his form, but makes it\nvisible in his bearing and occupation, by action of every kind, and the\nmodifications of knowing and willing that occasion and accompany it. The\nIdea of man must be exhibited in these circumstances, and therefore the\nunfolding of its many-sidedness must be brought before our eyes by means\nof representative individuals, and these individuals can only be made\nvisible in their significance through various scenes, events, and actions.\nThis is the endless problem of the historical painter, and he solves it by\nplacing before us scenes of life of every kind, of greater or less\nsignificance. No individual and no action can be without significance; in\nall and through all the Idea of man unfolds itself more and more.\nTherefore no event of human life is excluded from the sphere of painting.\nIt is thus a great injustice to the excellent painters of the Dutch\nschool, to prize merely their technical skill, and to look down upon them\nin other respects, because, for the most part, they represent objects of\ncommon life, whereas it is assumed that only the events of the history of\nthe world, or the incidents of biblical story, have significance. We ought\nfirst to bethink ourselves that the inward significance of an action is\nquite different from its outward significance, and that these are often\nseparated from each other. The outward significance is the importance of\nan action in relation to its result for and in the actual world; thus\naccording to the principle of sufficient reason. The inward significance\nis the depth of the insight into the Idea of man which it reveals, in that\nit brings to light sides of that Idea which rarely appear, by making\nindividuals who assert themselves distinctly and decidedly, disclose their\npeculiar characteristics by means of appropriately arranged circumstances.\nOnly the inward significance concerns art; the outward belongs to history.\nThey are both completely independent of each other; they may appear\ntogether, but may each appear alone. An action which is of the highest\nsignificance for history may in inward significance be a very ordinary and\ncommon one; and conversely, a scene of ordinary daily life may be of great\ninward significance, if human individuals, and the inmost recesses of\nhuman action and will, appear in it in a clear and distinct light.\nFurther, the outward and the inward significance of a scene may be equal\nand yet very different. Thus, for example, it is all the same, as far as\ninward significance is concerned, whether ministers discuss the fate of\ncountries and nations over a map, or boors wrangle in a beer-house over\ncards and dice, just as it is all the same whether we play chess with\ngolden or wooden pieces. But apart from this, the scenes and events that\nmake up the life of so many millions of men, their actions, their sorrows,\ntheir joys, are on that account important enough to be the object of art,\nand by their rich variety they must afford material enough for unfolding\nthe many-sided Idea of man. Indeed the very transitoriness of the moment\nwhich art has fixed in such a picture (now called _genre_-painting)\nexcites a slight and peculiar sensation; for to fix the fleeting,\never-changing world in the enduring picture of a single event, which yet\nrepresents the whole, is an achievement of the art of painting by which it\nseems to bring time itself to a standstill, for it raises the individual\nto the Idea of its species. Finally, the historical and outwardly\nsignificant subjects of painting have often the disadvantage that just\nwhat is significant in them cannot be presented to perception, but must be\narrived at by thought. In this respect the nominal significance of the\npicture must be distinguished from its real significance. The former is\nthe outward significance, which, however, can only be reached as a\nconception; the latter is that side of the Idea of man which is made\nvisible to the onlooker in the picture. For example, Moses found by the\nEgyptian princess is the nominal significance of a painting; it represents\na moment of the greatest importance in history; the real significance, on\nthe other hand, that which is really given to the onlooker, is a foundling\nchild rescued from its floating cradle by a great lady, an incident which\nmay have happened more than once. The costume alone can here indicate the\nparticular historical case to the learned; but the costume is only of\nimportance to the nominal significance, and is a matter of indifference to\nthe real significance; for the latter knows only the human being as such,\nnot the arbitrary forms. Subjects taken from history have no advantage\nover those which are taken from mere possibility, and which are therefore\nto be called, not individual, but merely general. For what is peculiarly\nsignificant in the former is not the individual, not the particular event\nas such, but the universal in it, the side of the Idea of humanity which\nexpresses itself through it. But, on the other hand, definite historical\nsubjects are not on this account to be rejected, only the really artistic\nview of such subjects, both in the painter and in the beholder, is never\ndirected to the individual particulars in them, which properly constitute\nthe historical, but to the universal which expresses itself in them, to\nthe Idea. And only those historical subjects are to be chosen the chief\npoint of which can actually be represented, and not merely arrived at by\nthought, otherwise the nominal significance is too remote from the real;\nwhat is merely thought in connection with the picture becomes of most\nimportance, and interferes with what is perceived. If even on the stage it\nis not right that the chief incident of the plot should take place behind\nthe scenes (as in French tragedies), it is clearly a far greater fault in\na picture. Historical subjects are distinctly disadvantageous only when\nthey confine the painter to a field which has not been chosen for artistic\nbut for other reasons, and especially when this field is poor in\npicturesque and significant objects—if, for example, it is the history of\na small, isolated, capricious, hierarchical (_i.e._, ruled by error),\nobscure people, like the Jews, despised by the great contemporary nations\nof the East and the West. Since the wandering of the tribes lies between\nus and all ancient nations, as the change of the bed of the ocean lies\nbetween the earth’s surface as it is to-day and as it was when those\norganisations existed which we only know from fossil remains, it is to be\nregarded generally as a great misfortune that the people whose culture was\nto be the principal basis of our own were not the Indians or the Greeks,\nor even the Romans, but these very Jews. But it was especially a great\nmisfortune for the Italian painters of genius in the fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries that, in the narrow sphere to which they were\narbitrarily driven for the choice of subjects, they were obliged to have\nrecourse to miserable beings of every kind. For the New Testament, as\nregards its historical part, is almost more unsuitable for painting than\nthe Old, and the subsequent history of martyrs and doctors of the church\nis a very unfortunate subject. Yet of the pictures, whose subject is the\nhistory or mythology of Judaism and Christianity, we must carefully\ndistinguish those in which the peculiar, _i.e._, the ethical spirit of\nChristianity is revealed for perception, by the representation of men who\nare full of this spirit. These representations are in fact the highest and\nmost admirable achievements of the art of painting; and only the greatest\nmasters of this art succeeded in this, particularly Raphael and Correggio,\nand especially in their earlier pictures. Pictures of this kind are not\nproperly to be classed as historical: for, as a rule, they represent no\nevent, no action; but are merely groups of saints, with the Saviour\nhimself, often still a child, with His mother, angels, &c. In their\ncountenances, and especially in the eyes, we see the expression, the\nreflection, of the completest knowledge, that which is not directed to\nparticular things, but has fully grasped the Ideas, and thus the whole\nnature of the world and life. And this knowledge in them, reacting upon\nthe will, does not, like other knowledge, convey _motives_ to it, but on\nthe contrary has become a _quieter_ of all will, from which proceeded the\ncomplete resignation, which is the innermost spirit of Christianity, as of\nthe Indian philosophy; the surrender of all volition, conversion, the\nsuppression of will, and with it of the whole inner being of this world,\nthat is to say, salvation. Thus these masters of art, worthy of eternal\npraise, expressed perceptibly in their works the highest wisdom. And this\nis the summit of all art. It has followed the will in its adequate\nobjectivity, the Ideas, through all its grades, in which it is affected\nand its nature unfolded in so many ways, first by causes, then by stimuli,\nand finally by motives. And now art ends with the representation of the\nfree self-suppression of will, by means of the great peace which it gains\nfrom the perfect knowledge of its own nature.(56)",

    "page_content": "said about art, is that the object of art, the representation of which is\nthe aim of the artist, and the knowledge of which must therefore precede\nhis work as its germ and source, is an Idea in Plato’s sense, and never\nanything else; not the particular thing, the object of common\napprehension, and not the concept, the object of rational thought and of\nscience. Although the Idea and the concept have something in common,\nbecause both represent as unity a multiplicity of real things; yet the\ngreat difference between them has no doubt been made clear and evident\nenough by what we have said about concepts in the first book, and about\nIdeas in this book. I by no means wish to assert, however, that Plato\nreally distinctly comprehended this difference; indeed many of his\nexamples of Ideas, and his discussions of them, are applicable only to\nconcepts. Meanwhile we leave this question alone and go on our own way,\nglad when we come upon traces of any great and noble mind, yet not\nfollowing his footsteps but our own aim. The _concept_ is abstract,\ndiscursive, undetermined within its own sphere, only determined by its\nlimits, attainable and comprehensible by him who has only reason,\ncommunicable by words without any other assistance, entirely exhausted by\nits definition. The _Idea_ on the contrary, although defined as the\nadequate representative of the concept, is always object of perception,\nand although representing an infinite number of particular things, is yet\nthoroughly determined. It is never known by the individual as such, but\nonly by him who has raised himself above all willing and all individuality\nto the pure subject of knowing. Thus it is only attainable by the man of\ngenius, and by him who, for the most part through the assistance of the\nworks of genius, has reached an exalted frame of mind, by increasing his\npower of pure knowing. It is therefore not absolutely but only\nconditionally communicable, because the Idea, comprehended and repeated in\nthe work of art, appeals to every one only according to the measure of his\nown intellectual worth. So that just the most excellent works of every\nart, the noblest productions of genius, must always remain sealed books to\nthe dull majority of men, inaccessible to them, separated from them by a\nwide gulf, just as the society of princes is inaccessible to the common\npeople. It is true that even the dullest of them accept on authority\nrecognisedly great works, lest otherwise they should argue their own\nincompetence; but they wait in silence, always ready to express their\ncondemnation, as soon as they are allowed to hope that they may do so\nwithout being left to stand alone; and then their long-restrained hatred\nagainst all that is great and beautiful, and against the authors of it,\ngladly relieves itself; for such things never appealed to them, and for\nthat very reason were humiliating to them. For as a rule a man must have\nworth in himself in order to recognise it and believe in it willingly and\nfreely in others. On this rests the necessity of modesty in all merit, and\nthe disproportionately loud praise of this virtue, which alone of all its\nsisters is always included in the eulogy of every one who ventures to\npraise any distinguished man, in order to appease and quiet the wrath of\nthe unworthy. What then is modesty but hypocritical humility, by means of\nwhich, in a world swelling with base envy, a man seeks to obtain pardon\nfor excellences and merits from those who have none? For whoever\nattributes to himself no merits, because he actually has none, is not\nmodest but merely honest.\n\nThe _Idea_ is the unity that falls into multiplicity on account of the\ntemporal and spatial form of our intuitive apprehension; the _concept_, on\nthe contrary, is the unity reconstructed out of multiplicity by the\nabstraction of our reason; the latter may be defined as _unitas post rem_,\nthe former as _unitas ante rem_. Finally, we may express the distinction\nbetween the Idea and the concept, by a comparison, thus: the _concept_ is\nlike a dead receptacle, in which, whatever has been put, actually lies\nside by side, but out of which no more can be taken (by analytical\njudgment) than was put in (by synthetical reflection); the (Platonic)\n_Idea_, on the other hand, develops, in him who has comprehended it, ideas\nwhich are new as regards the concept of the same name; it resembles a\nliving organism, developing itself and possessed of the power of\nreproduction, which brings forth what was not put into it.\n\nIt follows from all that has been said, that the concept, useful as it is\nin life, and serviceable, necessary and productive as it is in science, is\nyet always barren and unfruitful in art. The comprehended Idea, on the\ncontrary, is the true and only source of every work of art. In its\npowerful originality it is only derived from life itself, from nature,\nfrom the world, and that only by the true genius, or by him whose\nmomentary inspiration reaches the point of genius. Genuine and immortal\nworks of art spring only from such direct apprehension. Just because the\nIdea is and remains object of perception, the artist is not conscious in\nthe abstract of the intention and aim of his work; not a concept, but an\nIdea floats before his mind; therefore he can give no justification of\nwhat he does. He works, as people say, from pure feeling, and\nunconsciously, indeed instinctively. On the contrary, imitators,\nmannerists, _imitatores, servum pecus_, start, in art, from the concept;\nthey observe what pleases and affects us in true works of art; understand\nit clearly, fix it in a concept, and thus abstractly, and then imitate it,\nopenly or disguisedly, with dexterity and intentionally. They suck their\nnourishment, like parasite plants, from the works of others, and like\npolypi, they become the colour of their food. We might carry comparison\nfurther, and say that they are like machines which mince fine and mingle\ntogether whatever is put into them, but can never digest it, so that the\ndifferent constituent parts may always be found again if they are sought\nout and separated from the mixture; the man of genius alone resembles the\norganised, assimilating, transforming and reproducing body. For he is\nindeed educated and cultured by his predecessors and their works; but he\nis really fructified only by life and the world directly, through the\nimpression of what he perceives; therefore the highest culture never\ninterferes with his originality. All imitators, all mannerists, apprehend\nin concepts the nature of representative works of art; but concepts can\nnever impart inner life to a work. The age, _i.e._, the dull multitude of\nevery time, knows only concepts, and sticks to them, and therefore\nreceives mannered works of art with ready and loud applause: but after a\nfew years these works become insipid, because the spirit of the age,\n_i.e._, the prevailing concepts, in which alone they could take root, have\nchanged. Only true works of art, which are drawn directly from nature and\nlife, have eternal youth and enduring power, like nature and life\nthemselves. For they belong to no age, but to humanity, and as on that\naccount they are coldly received by their own age, to which they disdain\nto link themselves closely, and because indirectly and negatively they\nexpose the existing errors, they are slowly and unwillingly recognised; on\nthe other hand, they cannot grow old, but appear to us ever fresh and new\ndown to the latest ages. Then they are no longer exposed to neglect and\nignorance, for they are crowned and sanctioned by the praise of the few\nmen capable of judging, who appear singly and rarely in the course of\nages,(57) and give in their votes, whose slowly growing number constitutes\nthe authority, which alone is the judgment-seat we mean when we appeal to\nposterity. It is these successively appearing individuals, for the mass of\nposterity will always be and remain just as perverse and dull as the mass\nof contemporaries always was and always is. We read the complaints of\ngreat men in every century about the customs of their age. They always\nsound as if they referred to our own age, for the race is always the same.\nAt every time and in every art, mannerisms have taken the place of the\nspirit, which was always the possession of a few individuals, but\nmannerisms are just the old cast-off garments of the last manifestation of\nthe spirit that existed and was recognised. From all this it appears that,\nas a rule, the praise of posterity can only be gained at the cost of the\npraise of one’s contemporaries, and _vice versa_.(58)",

    "page_content": "which through the mind of the artist appears in such a form that it is\npurged and isolated from all that is foreign to it, and may now be grasped\nby the man of weaker comprehension and no productive faculty; if further,\nit is forbidden in art to start from the concept, we shall not be able to\nconsent to the intentional and avowed employment of a work of art for the\nexpression of a concept; this is the case in the _Allegory_. An allegory\nis a work of art which means something different from what it represents.\nBut the object of perception, and consequently also the Idea, expresses\nitself directly and completely, and does not require the medium of\nsomething else which implies or indicates it. Thus, that which in this way\nis indicated and represented by something entirely different, because it\ncannot itself be made object of perception, is always a concept. Therefore\nthrough the allegory a conception has always to be signified, and\nconsequently the mind of the beholder has to be drawn away from the\nexpressed perceptible idea to one which is entirely different, abstract\nand not perceptible, and which lies quite outside the work of art. The\npicture or statue is intended to accomplish here what is accomplished far\nmore fully by a book. Now, what we hold is the end of art, representation\nof a perceivable, comprehensible Idea, is not here the end. No great\ncompleteness in the work of art is demanded for what is aimed at here. It\nis only necessary that we should see what the thing is meant to be, for,\nas soon as this has been discovered, the end is reached, and the mind is\nnow led away to quite a different kind of idea to an abstract conception,\nwhich is the end that was in view. Allegories in plastic and pictorial art\nare, therefore, nothing but hieroglyphics; the artistic value which they\nmay have as perceptible representations, belongs to them not as\nallegories, but otherwise. That the “Night” of Correggio, the “Genius of\nFame” of Hannibal Caracci, and the “Hours” of Poussin, are very beautiful\npictures, is to be separated altogether from the fact that they are\nallegories. As allegories they do not accomplish more than a legend,\nindeed rather less. We are here again reminded of the distinction drawn\nabove between the real and the nominal significance of a picture. The\nnominal is here the allegorical as such, for example, the “Genius of\nFame.” The real is what is actually represented, in this case a beautiful\nwinged youth, surrounded by beautiful boys; this expresses an Idea. But\nthis real significance affects us only so long as we forget the nominal,\nallegorical significance; if we think of the latter, we forsake the\nperception, and the mind is occupied with an abstract conception; but the\ntransition from the Idea to the conception is always a fall. Indeed, that\nnominal significance, that allegorical intention, often injures the real\nsignificance, the perceptible truth. For example, the unnatural light in\nthe “Night” of Correggio, which, though beautifully executed, has yet a\nmerely allegorical motive, and is really impossible. If then an\nallegorical picture has artistic value, it is quite separate from and\nindependent of what it accomplishes as allegory. Such a work of art serves\ntwo ends at once, the expression of a conception and the expression of an\nIdea. Only the latter can be an end of art; the other is a foreign end,\nthe trifling amusement of making a picture also do service as a legend, as\na hieroglyphic, invented for the pleasure of those to whom the true nature\nof art can never appeal. It is the same thing as when a work of art is\nalso a useful implement of some kind, in which case it also serves two\nends; for example, a statue which is at the same time a candelabrum or a\ncaryatide; or a bas-relief, which is also the shield of Achilles. True\nlovers of art will allow neither the one nor the other. It is true that an\nallegorical picture may, because of this quality, produce a vivid\nimpression upon the feelings; but when this is the case, a legend would\nunder the same circumstances produce the same effect. For example, if the\ndesire of fame were firmly and lastingly rooted in the heart of a man,\nbecause he regarded it as his rightful possession, which is only withheld\nfrom him so long as he has not produced the charter of his ownership; and\nif the Genius of Fame, with his laurel crown, were to appear to such a\nman, his whole mind would be excited, and his powers called into activity;\nbut the same effect would be produced if he were suddenly to see the word\n“fame,” in large distinct letters on the wall. Or if a man has made known\na truth, which is of importance either as a maxim for practical life, or\nas insight for science, but it has not been believed; an allegorical\npicture representing time as it lifts the veil, and discloses the naked\nfigure of Truth, will affect him powerfully; but the same effect would be\nproduced by the legend: “_Le temps découvre la vérité._” For what really\nproduces the effect here is the abstract thought, not the object of\nperception.\n\nIf then, in accordance with what has been said, allegory in plastic and\npictorial art is a mistaken effort, serving an end which is entirely\nforeign to art, it becomes quite unbearable when it leads so far astray\nthat the representation of forced and violently introduced subtilties\ndegenerates into absurdity. Such, for example, is a tortoise, to represent\nfeminine seclusion; the downward glance of Nemesis into the drapery of her\nbosom, signifying that she can see into what is hidden; the explanation of\nBellori that Hannibal Carracci represents voluptuousness clothed in a\nyellow robe, because he wishes to indicate that her lovers soon fade and\nbecome yellow as straw. If there is absolutely no connection between the\nrepresentation and the conception signified by it, founded on subsumption\nunder the concept, or association of Ideas; but the signs and the things\nsignified are combined in a purely conventional manner, by positive,\naccidentally introduced laws; then I call this degenerate kind of allegory\n_Symbolism_. Thus the rose is the symbol of secrecy, the laurel is the\nsymbol of fame, the palm is the symbol of peace, the scallop-shell is the\nsymbol of pilgrimage, the cross is the symbol of the Christian religion.\nTo this class also belongs all significance of mere colour, as yellow is\nthe colour of falseness, and blue is the colour of fidelity. Such symbols\nmay often be of use in life, but their value is foreign to art. They are\nsimply to be regarded as hieroglyphics, or like Chinese word-writing, and\nreally belong to the same class as armorial bearings, the bush that\nindicates a public-house, the key of the chamberlain, or the leather of\nthe mountaineer. If, finally, certain historical or mythical persons, or\npersonified conceptions, are represented by certain fixed symbols, these\nare properly called _emblems_. Such are the beasts of the Evangelist, the\nowl of Minerva, the apple of Paris, the Anchor of Hope, &c. For the most\npart, however, we understand by emblems those simple allegorical\nrepresentations explained by a motto, which are meant to express a moral\ntruth, and of which large collections have been made by J. Camerarius,\nAlciatus, and others. They form the transition to poetical allegory, of\nwhich we shall have more to say later. Greek sculpture devotes itself to\nthe perception, and therefore it is _æsthetical_; Indian sculpture devotes\nitself to the conception, and therefore it is merely _symbolical_.\n\nThis conclusion in regard to allegory, which is founded on our\nconsideration of the nature of art and quite consistent with it, is\ndirectly opposed to the opinion of Winckelmann, who, far from explaining\nallegory, as we do, as something quite foreign to the end of art, and\noften interfering with it, always speaks in favour of it, and indeed\n(Works, vol. i. p. 55) places the highest aim of art in the\n“representation of universal conceptions, and non-sensuous things.” We\nleave it to every one to adhere to whichever view he pleases. Only the\ntruth became very clear to me from these and similar views of Winckelmann\nconnected with his peculiar metaphysic of the beautiful, that one may have\nthe greatest susceptibility for artistic beauty, and the soundest judgment\nin regard to it, without being able to give an abstract and strictly\nphilosophical justification of the nature of the beautiful; just as one\nmay be very noble and virtuous, and may have a tender conscience, which\ndecides with perfect accuracy in particular cases, without on that account\nbeing in a position to investigate and explain in the abstract the ethical\nsignificance of action.\n\nAllegory has an entirely different relation to poetry from that which it\nhas to plastic and pictorial art, and although it is to be rejected in the\nlatter, it is not only permissible, but very serviceable to the former.\nFor in plastic and pictorial art it leads away from what is perceptibly\ngiven, the proper object of all art, to abstract thoughts; but in poetry\nthe relation is reversed; for here what is directly given in words is the\nconcept, and the first aim is to lead from this to the object of\nperception, the representation of which must be undertaken by the\nimagination of the hearer. If in plastic and pictorial art we are led from\nwhat is immediately given to something else, this must always be a\nconception, because here only the abstract cannot be given directly; but a\nconception must never be the source, and its communication must never be\nthe end of a work of art. In poetry, on the contrary, the conception is\nthe material, the immediately given, and therefore we may very well leave\nit, in order to call up perceptions which are quite different, and in\nwhich the end is reached. Many a conception or abstract thought may be\nquite indispensable to the connection of a poem, which is yet, in itself\nand directly, quite incapable of being perceived; and then it is often\nmade perceptible by means of some example which is subsumed under it. This\ntakes place in every trope, every metaphor, simile, parable, and allegory,\nall of which differ only in the length and completeness of their\nexpression. Therefore, in the arts which employ language as their medium,\nsimiles and allegories are of striking effect. How beautifully Cervantes\nsays of sleep in order to express the fact that it frees us from all\nspiritual and bodily suffering, “It is a mantle that covers all mankind.”\nHow beautifully Kleist expresses allegorically the thought that\nphilosophers and men of science enlighten mankind, in the line, “Those\nwhose midnight lamp lights the world.” How strongly and sensuously Homer\ndescribes the harmful Ate when he says: “She has tender feet, for she\nwalks not on the hard earth, but treads on the heads of men” (Il. xix.\n91.) How forcibly we are struck by Menenius Agrippa’s fable of the belly\nand the limbs, addressed to the people of Rome when they seceded. How\nbeautifully Plato’s figure of the Cave, at the beginning of the seventh\nbook of the “Republic” to which we have already referred, expresses a very\nabstract philosophical dogma. The fable of Persephone is also to be\nregarded as a deeply significant allegory of philosophical tendency, for\nshe became subject to the nether world by tasting a pomegranate. This\nbecomes peculiarly enlightening from Goethe’s treatment of the fable, as\nan episode in the _Triumph der Empfindsamkeit_, which is beyond all\npraise. Three detailed allegorical works are known to me, one, open and\navowed, is the incomparable “Criticon” of Balthasar Gracian. It consists\nof a great rich web of connected and highly ingenious allegories, that\nserve here as the fair clothing of moral truths, to which he thus imparts\nthe most perceptible form, and astonishes us by the richness of his\ninvention. The two others are concealed allegories, “Don Quixote” and\n“Gulliver’s Travels.” The first is an allegory of the life of every man,\nwho will not, like others, be careful, merely for his own welfare, but\nfollows some objective, ideal end, which has taken possession of his\nthoughts and will; and certainly, in this world, he has then a strange\nappearance. In the case of Gulliver we have only to take everything\nphysical as spiritual or intellectual, in order to see what the “satirical\nrogue,” as Hamlet would call him, meant by it. Such, then, in the poetical\nallegory, the conception is always the given, which it tries to make\nperceptible by means of a picture; it may sometimes be expressed or\nassisted by a painted picture. Such a picture will not be regarded as a\nwork of art, but only as a significant symbol, and it makes no claim to\npictorial, but only to poetical worth. Such is that beautiful allegorical\nvignette of Lavater’s, which must be so heartening to every defender of\ntruth: a hand holding a light is stung by a wasp, while gnats are burning\nthemselves in the flame above; underneath is the motto:\n\n    “And although it singes the wings of the gnats,\n    Destroys their heads and all their little brains,\n                  Light is still light;\n    And although I am stung by the angriest wasp,\n                  I will not let it go.”\n\nTo this class also belongs the gravestone with the burnt-out, smoking\ncandle, and the inscription—\n\n    “When it is out, it becomes clear\n    Whether the candle was tallow or wax.”\n\nFinally, of this kind is an old German genealogical tree, in which the\nlast representative of a very ancient family thus expresses his\ndetermination to live his life to the end in abstinence and perfect\nchastity, and therefore to let his race die out; he represents himself at\nthe root of the high-branching tree cutting it over himself with shears.\nIn general all those symbols referred to above, commonly called emblems,\nwhich might also be defined as short painted fables with obvious morals,\nbelong to this class. Allegories of this kind are always to be regarded as\nbelonging to poetry, not to painting, and as justified thereby; moreover,\nthe pictorial execution is here always a matter of secondary importance,\nand no more is demanded of it than that it shall represent the thing so\nthat we can recognise it. But in poetry, as in plastic art, the allegory\npasses into the symbol if there is merely an arbitrary connection between\nwhat it presented to perception and the abstract significance of it. For\nas all symbolism rests, at bottom, on an agreement, the symbol has this\namong other disadvantages, that in time its meaning is forgotten, and then\nit is dumb. Who would guess why the fish is a symbol of Christianity if he\ndid not know? Only a Champollion; for it is entirely a phonetic\nhieroglyphic. Therefore, as a poetical allegory, the Revelation of John\nstands much in the same position as the reliefs with _Magnus Deus sol\nMithra_, which are still constantly being explained.",

    "page_content": "we turn from plastic and pictorial art to poetry, we shall have no doubt\nthat its aim also is the revelation of the Ideas, the grades of the\nobjectification of will, and the communication of them to the hearer with\nthe distinctness and vividness with which the poetical sense comprehends\nthem. Ideas are essentially perceptible; if, therefore, in poetry only\nabstract conceptions are directly communicated through words, it is yet\nclearly the intention to make the hearer perceive the Ideas of life in the\nrepresentatives of these conceptions, and this can only take place through\nthe assistance of his own imagination. But in order to set the imagination\nto work for the accomplishment of this end, the abstract conceptions,\nwhich are the immediate material of poetry as of dry prose, must be so\narranged that their spheres intersect each other in such a way that none\nof them can remain in its abstract universality; but, instead of it, a\nperceptible representative appears to the imagination; and this is always\nfurther modified by the words of the poet according to what his intention\nmay be. As the chemist obtains solid precipitates by combining perfectly\nclear and transparent fluids; the poet understands how to precipitate, as\nit were, the concrete, the individual, the perceptible idea, out of the\nabstract and transparent universality of the concepts by the manner in\nwhich he combines them. For the Idea can only be known by perception; and\nknowledge of the Idea is the end of art. The skill of a master, in poetry\nas in chemistry, enables us always to obtain the precise precipitate we\nintended. This end is assisted by the numerous epithets in poetry, by\nmeans of which the universality of every concept is narrowed more and more\ntill we reach the perceptible. Homer attaches to almost every substantive\nan adjective, whose concept intersects and considerably diminishes the\nsphere of the concept of the substantive, which is thus brought so much\nthe nearer to perception: for example—\n\n    “Εν δ᾽ επεσ᾽ Ωκεανῳ λαμπρον φαος ἡελιοιο,\n    Ἑλκον νυκτα μελαιναν επι ζειδωρον αρουραν.”\n\n    (“Occidit vero in Oceanum splendidum lumen solis,\n    Trahens noctem nigram super almam terram.”)\n\nAnd—\n\n    “Where gentle winds from the blue heavens sigh,\n    There stand the myrtles still, the laurel high,”—\n\ncalls up before the imagination by means of a few concepts the whole\ndelight of a southern clime.\n\nRhythm and rhyme are quite peculiar aids to poetry. I can give no other\nexplanation of their incredibly powerful effect than that our faculties of\nperception have received from time, to which they are essentially bound,\nsome quality on account of which we inwardly follow, and, as it were,\nconsent to each regularly recurring sound. In this way rhythm and rhyme\nare partly a means of holding our attention, because we willingly follow\nthe poem read, and partly they produce in us a blind consent to what is\nread prior to any judgment, and this gives the poem a certain emphatic\npower of convincing independent of all reasons.\n\nFrom the general nature of the material, that is, the concepts, which\npoetry uses to communicate the Ideas, the extent of its province is very\ngreat. The whole of nature, the Ideas of all grades, can be represented by\nmeans of it, for it proceeds according to the Idea it has to impart, so\nthat its representations are sometimes descriptive, sometimes narrative,\nand sometimes directly dramatic. If, in the representation of the lower\ngrades of the objectivity of will, plastic and pictorial art generally\nsurpass it, because lifeless nature, and even brute nature, reveals almost\nits whole being in a single well-chosen moment; man, on the contrary, so\nfar as he does not express himself by the mere form and expression of his\nperson, but through a series of actions and the accompanying thoughts and\nemotions, is the principal object of poetry, in which no other art can\ncompete with it, for here the progress or movement which cannot be\nrepresented in plastic or pictorial art just suits its purpose.\n\nThe revelation of the Idea, which is the highest grade of the objectivity\nof will, the representation of man in the connected series of his efforts\nand actions, is thus the great problem of poetry. It is true that both\nexperience and history teach us to know man; yet oftener men than man,\n_i.e._, they give us empirical notes of the behaviour of men to each\nother, from which we may frame rules for our own conduct, oftener than\nthey afford us deep glimpses of the inner nature of man. The latter\nfunction, however, is by no means entirely denied them; but as often as it\nis the nature of mankind itself that discloses itself to us in history or\nin our own experience, we have comprehended our experience, and the\nhistorian has comprehended history, with artistic eyes, poetically,\n_i.e._, according to the Idea, not the phenomenon, in its inner nature,\nnot in its relations. Our own experience is the indispensable condition of\nunderstanding poetry as of understanding history; for it is, so to speak,\nthe dictionary of the language that both speak. But history is related to\npoetry as portrait-painting is related to historical painting; the one\ngives us the true in the individual, the other the true in the universal;\nthe one has the truth of the phenomenon, and can therefore verify it from\nthe phenomenal, the other has the truth of the Idea, which can be found in\nno particular phenomenon, but yet speaks to us from them all. The poet\nfrom deliberate choice represents significant characters in significant\nsituations; the historian takes both as they come. Indeed, he must regard\nand select the circumstances and the persons, not with reference to their\ninward and true significance, which expresses the Idea, but according to\nthe outward, apparent, and relatively important significance with regard\nto the connection and the consequences. He must consider nothing in and\nfor itself in its essential character and expression, but must look at\neverything in its relations, in its connection, in its influence upon what\nfollows, and especially upon its own age. Therefore he will not overlook\nan action of a king, though of little significance, and in itself quite\ncommon, because it has results and influence. And, on the other hand,\nactions of the highest significance of particular and very eminent\nindividuals are not to be recorded by him if they have no consequences.\nFor his treatment follows the principle of sufficient reason, and\napprehends the phenomenon, of which this principle is the form. But the\npoet comprehends the Idea, the inner nature of man apart from all\nrelations, outside all time, the adequate objectivity of the\nthing-in-itself, at its highest grade. Even in that method of treatment\nwhich is necessary for the historian, the inner nature and significance of\nthe phenomena, the kernel of all these shells, can never be entirely lost.\nHe who seeks for it, at any rate, may find it and recognise it. Yet that\nwhich is significant in itself, not in its relations, the real unfolding\nof the Idea, will be found far more accurately and distinctly in poetry\nthan in history, and, therefore, however paradoxical it may sound, far\nmore really genuine inner truth is to be attributed to poetry than to\nhistory. For the historian must accurately follow the particular event\naccording to life, as it develops itself in time in the manifold tangled\nchains of causes and effects. It is, however, impossible that he can have\nall the data for this; he cannot have seen all and discovered all. He is\nforsaken at every moment by the original of his picture, or a false one\nsubstitutes itself for it, and this so constantly that I think I may\nassume that in all history the false outweighs the true. The poet, on the\ncontrary, has comprehended the Idea of man from some definite side which\nis to be represented; thus it is the nature of his own self that\nobjectifies itself in it for him. His knowledge, as we explained above\nwhen speaking of sculpture, is half _a priori_; his ideal stands before\nhis mind firm, distinct, brightly illuminated, and cannot forsake him;\ntherefore he shows us, in the mirror of his mind, the Idea pure and\ndistinct, and his delineation of it down to the minutest particular is\ntrue as life itself.(59) The great ancient historians are, therefore, in\nthose particulars in which their data fail them, for example, in the\nspeeches of their heroes—poets; indeed their whole manner of handling\ntheir material approaches to the epic. But this gives their\nrepresentations unity, and enables them to retain inner truth, even when\noutward truth was not accessible, or indeed was falsified. And as we\ncompared history to portrait-painting, in contradistinction to poetry,\nwhich corresponds to historical painting, we find that Winckelmann’s\nmaxim, that the portrait ought to be the ideal of the individual, was\nfollowed by the ancient historians, for they represent the individual in\nsuch a way as to bring out that side of the Idea of man which is expressed\nin it. Modern historians, on the contrary, with few exceptions, give us in\ngeneral only “a dust-bin and a lumber-room, and at the most a chronicle of\nthe principal political events.” Therefore, whoever desires to know man in\nhis inner nature, identical in all its phenomena and developments, to know\nhim according to the Idea, will find that the works of the great, immortal\npoet present a far truer, more distinct picture, than the historians can\never give. For even the best of the historians are, as poets, far from the\nfirst; and moreover their hands are tied. In this aspect the relation\nbetween the historian and the poet may be illustrated by the following\ncomparison. The mere, pure historian, who works only according to data, is\nlike a man, who without any knowledge of mathematics, has investigated the\nrelations of certain figures, which he has accidentally found, by\nmeasuring them; and the problem thus empirically solved is affected of\ncourse by all the errors of the drawn figure. The poet, on the other hand,\nis like the mathematician, who constructs these relations _a priori_ in\npure perception, and expresses them not as they actually are in the drawn\nfigure, but as they are in the Idea, which the drawing is intended to\nrender for the senses. Therefore Schiller says:—\n\n    “What has never anywhere come to pass,\n    That alone never grows old.”\n\nIndeed I must attribute greater value to biographies, and especially to\nautobiographies, in relation to the knowledge of the nature of man, than\nto history proper, at least as it is commonly handled. Partly because in\nthe former the data can be collected more accurately and completely than\nin the latter; partly, because in history proper, it is not so much men as\nnations and heroes that act, and the individuals who do appear, seem so\nfar off, surrounded with such pomp and circumstance, clothed in the stiff\nrobes of state, or heavy, inflexible armour, that it is really hard\nthrough all this to recognise the human movements. On the other hand, the\nlife of the individual when described with truth, in a narrow sphere,\nshows the conduct of men in all its forms and subtilties, the excellence,\nthe virtue, and even holiness of a few, the perversity, meanness, and\nknavery of most, the dissolute profligacy of some. Besides, in the only\naspect we are considering here, that of the inner significance of the\nphenomenal, it is quite the same whether the objects with which the action\nis concerned, are, relatively considered, trifling or important,\nfarm-houses or kingdoms: for all these things in themselves are without\nsignificance, and obtain it only in so far as the will is moved by them.\nThe motive has significance only through its relation to the will, while\nthe relation which it has as a thing to other things like itself, does not\nconcern us here. As a circle of one inch in diameter, and a circle of\nforty million miles in diameter, have precisely the same geometrical\nproperties, so are the events and the history of a village and a kingdom\nessentially the same; and we may study and learn to know mankind as well\nin the one as in the other. It is also a mistake to suppose that\nautobiographies are full of deceit and dissimulation. On the contrary,\nlying (though always possible) is perhaps more difficult there than\nelsewhere. Dissimulation is easiest in mere conversation; indeed, though\nit may sound paradoxical, it is really more difficult even in a letter.\nFor in the case of a letter the writer is alone, and looks into himself,\nand not out on the world, so that what is strange and distant does not\neasily approach him; and he has not the test of the impression made upon\nanother before his eyes. But the receiver of the letter peruses it quietly\nin a mood unknown to the writer, reads it repeatedly and at different\ntimes, and thus easily finds out the concealed intention. We also get to\nknow an author as a man most easily from his books, because all these\ncircumstances act here still more strongly and permanently. And in an\nautobiography it is so difficult to dissimulate, that perhaps there does\nnot exist a single one that is not, as a whole, more true, than any\nhistory that ever was written. The man who writes his own life surveys it\nas a whole, the particular becomes small, the near becomes distant, the\ndistant becomes near again, the motives that influenced him shrink; he\nseats himself at the confessional, and has done so of his own free will;\nthe spirit of lying does not so easily take hold of him here, for there is\nalso in every man an inclination to truth which has first to be overcome\nwhenever he lies, and which here has taken up a specially strong position.\nThe relation between biography and the history of nations may be made\nclear for perception by means of the following comparison: History shows\nus mankind as a view from a high mountain shows us nature; we see much at\na time, wide stretches, great masses, but nothing is distinct nor\nrecognisable in all the details of its own peculiar nature. On the other\nhand, the representation of the life of the individual shows us the man,\nas we see nature if we go about among her trees, plants, rocks, and\nwaters. But in landscape-painting, in which the artist lets us look at\nnature with his eyes, the knowledge of the Ideas, and the condition of\npure will-less knowing, which is demanded by these, is made much easier\nfor us; and, in the same way, poetry is far superior both to history and\nbiography, in the representation of the Ideas which may be looked for in\nall three. For here also genius holds up to us the magic glass, in which\nall that is essential and significant appears before us collected and\nplaced in the clearest light, and what is accidental and foreign is left\nout.(60)\n\nThe representation of the Idea of man, which is the work of the poet, may\nbe performed, so that what is represented is also the representer. This is\nthe case in lyrical poetry, in songs, properly so called, in which the\npoet only perceives vividly his own state and describes it. Thus a certain\nsubjectivity is essential to this kind of poetry from the nature of its\nobject. Again, what is to be represented may be entirely different from\nhim who represents it, as is the case in all other kinds of poetry, in\nwhich the poet more or less conceals himself behind his representation,\nand at last disappears altogether. In the ballad the poet still expresses\nto some extent his own state through the tone and proportion of the whole;\ntherefore, though much more objective than the lyric, it has yet something\nsubjective. This becomes less in the idyll, still less in the romantic\npoem, almost entirely disappears in the true epic, and even to the last\nvestige in the drama, which is the most objective and, in more than one\nrespect, the completest and most difficult form of poetry. The lyrical\nform of poetry is consequently the easiest, and although art, as a whole,\nbelongs only to the true man of genius, who so rarely appears, even a man\nwho is not in general very remarkable may produce a beautiful song if, by\nactual strong excitement from without, some inspiration raises his mental\npowers; for all that is required for this is a lively perception of his\nown state at a moment of emotional excitement. This is proved by the\nexistence of many single songs by individuals who have otherwise remained\nunknown; especially the German national songs, of which we have an\nexquisite collection in the “Wunderhorn;” and also by innumerable\nlove-songs and other songs of the people in all languages;—for to seize\nthe mood of a moment and embody it in a song is the whole achievement of\nthis kind of poetry. Yet in the lyrics of true poets the inner nature of\nall mankind is reflected, and all that millions of past, present, and\nfuture men have found, or will find, in the same situations, which are\nconstantly recurring, finds its exact expression in them. And because\nthese situations, by constant recurrence, are permanent as man himself and\nalways call up the same sensations, the lyrical productions of genuine\npoets remain through thousands of years true, powerful, and fresh. But if\nthe poet is always the universal man, then all that has ever moved a human\nheart, all that human nature in any situation has ever produced from\nitself, all that dwells and broods in any human breast—is his theme and\nhis material, and also all the rest of nature. Therefore the poet may just\nas well sing of voluptuousness as of mysticism, be Anacreon or Angelus\nSilesius, write tragedies or comedies, represent the sublime or the common\nmind—according to humour or vocation. And no one has the right to\nprescribe to the poet what he ought to be—noble and sublime, moral, pious,\nChristian, one thing or another, still less to reproach him because he is\none thing and not another. He is the mirror of mankind, and brings to its\nconsciousness what it feels and does.\n\nIf we now consider more closely the nature of the lyric proper, and select\nas examples exquisite and pure models, not those that approach in any way\nto some other form of poetry, such as the ballad, the elegy, the hymn, the\nepigram, &c., we shall find that the peculiar nature of the lyric, in the\nnarrowest sense, is this: It is the subject of will, _i.e._, his own\nvolition, which the consciousness of the singer feels; often as a released\nand satisfied desire (joy), but still oftener as a restricted desire\n(grief), always as an emotion, a passion, a moved frame of mind. Besides\nthis, however, and along with it, by the sight of surrounding nature, the\nsinger becomes conscious of himself as the subject of pure, will-less\nknowing, whose unbroken blissful peace now appears, in contrast to the\nstress of desire which is always restricted and always needy. The feeling\nof this contrast, this alternation, is really what the lyric as a whole\nexpresses, and what principally constitutes the lyrical state of mind. In\nit pure knowing comes to us, as it were, to deliver us from desire and its\nstain; we follow, but only for an instant; desire, the remembrance of our\nown personal ends, tears us anew from peaceful contemplation; yet ever\nagain the next beautiful surrounding in which the pure will-less knowledge\npresents itself to us, allures us away from desire. Therefore, in the\nlyric and the lyrical mood, desire (the personal interest of the ends),\nand pure perception of the surrounding presented, are wonderfully mingled\nwith each other; connections between them are sought for and imagined; the\nsubjective disposition, the affection of the will, imparts its own hue to\nthe perceived surrounding, and conversely, the surroundings communicate\nthe reflex of their colour to the will. The true lyric is the expression\nof the whole of this mingled and divided state of mind. In order to make\nclear by examples this abstract analysis of a frame of mind that is very\nfar from all abstraction, any of the immortal songs of Goethe may be\ntaken. As specially adapted for this end I shall recommend only a few:\n“The Shepherd’s Lament,” “Welcome and Farewell,” “To the Moon,” “On the\nLake,” “Autumn;” also the songs in the “Wunderhorn” are excellent\nexamples; particularly the one which begins, “O Bremen, I must now leave\nthee.” As a comical and happy parody of the lyrical character a song of\nVoss strikes me as remarkable. It describes the feeling of a drunk plumber\nfalling from a tower, who observes in passing that the clock on the tower\nis at half-past eleven, a remark which is quite foreign to his condition,\nand thus belongs to knowledge free from will. Whoever accepts the view\nthat has been expressed of the lyrical frame of mind, will also allow,\nthat it is the sensuous and poetical knowledge of the principle which I\nestablished in my essay on the Principle of Sufficient Reason, and have\nalso referred to in this work, that the identity of the subject of knowing\nwith that of willing may be called the miracle κατ᾽ εξοχην; so that the\npoetical effect of the lyric rests finally on the truth of that principle.\nIn the course of life these two subjects, or, in popular language, head\nand heart, are ever becoming further apart; men are always separating more\nbetween their subjective feeling and their objective knowledge. In the\nchild the two are still entirely blended together; it scarcely knows how\nto distinguish itself from its surroundings, it is at one with them. In\nthe young man all perception chiefly affects feeling and mood, and even\nmingles with it, as Byron very beautifully expresses—\n\n    “I live not in myself, but I become\n    Portion of that around me; and to me\n    High mountains are a feeling.”\n\nThis is why the youth clings so closely to the perceptible and outward\nside of things; this is why he is only fit for lyrical poetry, and only\nthe full-grown man is capable of the drama. The old man we can think of as\nat the most an epic poet, like Ossian, and Homer, for narration is\ncharacteristic of old age.\n\nIn the more objective kinds of poetry, especially in the romance, the\nepic, and the drama, the end, the revelation of the Idea of man, is\nprincipally attained by two means, by true and profound representation of\nsignificant characters, and by the invention of pregnant situations in\nwhich they disclose themselves. For as it is incumbent upon the chemist\nnot only to exhibit the simple elements, pure and genuine, and their\nprincipal compounds, but also to expose them to the influence of such\nreagents as will clearly and strikingly bring out their peculiar\nqualities, so is it incumbent on the poet not only to present to us\nsignificant characters truly and faithfully as nature itself; but, in\norder that we may get to know them, he must place them in those situations\nin which their peculiar qualities will fully unfold themselves, and appear\ndistinctly in sharp outline; situations which are therefore called\nsignificant. In real life, and in history, situations of this kind are\nrarely brought about by chance, and they stand alone, lost and concealed\nin the multitude of those which are insignificant. The complete\nsignificance of the situations ought to distinguish the romance, the epic,\nand the drama from real life as completely as the arrangement and\nselection of significant characters. In both, however, absolute truth is a\nnecessary condition of their effect, and want of unity in the characters,\ncontradiction either of themselves or of the nature of humanity in\ngeneral, as well as impossibility, or very great improbability in the\nevents, even in mere accessories, offend just as much in poetry as badly\ndrawn figures, false perspective, or wrong lighting in painting. For both\nin poetry and painting we demand the faithful mirror of life, of man, of\nthe world, only made more clear by the representation, and more\nsignificant by the arrangement. For there is only one end of all the arts,\nthe representation of the Ideas; and their essential difference lies\nsimply in the different grades of the objectification of will to which the\nIdeas that are to be represented belong. This also determines the material\nof the representation. Thus the arts which are most widely separated may\nyet throw light on each other. For example, in order to comprehend fully\nthe Ideas of water it is not sufficient to see it in the quiet pond or in\nthe evenly-flowing stream; but these Ideas disclose themselves fully only\nwhen the water appears under all circumstances and exposed to all kinds of\nobstacles. The effects of the varied circumstances and obstacles give it\nthe opportunity of fully exhibiting all its qualities. This is why we find\nit beautiful when it tumbles, rushes, and foams, or leaps into the air, or\nfalls in a cataract of spray; or, lastly, if artificially confined it\nsprings up in a fountain. Thus showing itself different under different\ncircumstances, it yet always faithfully asserts its character; it is just\nas natural to it to spout up as to lie in glassy stillness; it is as ready\nfor the one as for the other as soon as the circumstances appear. Now,\nwhat the engineer achieves with the fluid matter of water, the architect\nachieves with the rigid matter of stone, and just this the epic or\ndramatic poet achieves with the Idea of man. Unfolding and rendering\ndistinct the Idea expressing itself in the object of every art, the Idea\nof the will which objectifies itself at each grade, is the common end of\nall the arts. The life of man, as it shows itself for the most part in the\nreal world, is like the water, as it is generally seen in the pond and the\nriver; but in the epic, the romance, the tragedy, selected characters are\nplaced in those circumstances in which all their special qualities unfold\nthemselves, the depths of the human heart are revealed, and become visible\nin extraordinary and very significant actions. Thus poetry objectifies the\nIdea of man, an Idea which has the peculiarity of expressing itself in\nhighly individual characters.\n\nTragedy is to be regarded, and is recognised as the summit of poetical\nart, both on account of the greatness of its effect and the difficulty of\nits achievement. It is very significant for our whole system, and well\nworthy of observation, that the end of this highest poetical achievement\nis the representation of the terrible side of life. The unspeakable pain,\nthe wail of humanity, the triumph of evil, the scornful mastery of chance,\nand the irretrievable fall of the just and innocent, is here presented to\nus; and in this lies a significant hint of the nature of the world and of\nexistence. It is the strife of will with itself, which here, completely\nunfolded at the highest grade of its objectivity, comes into fearful\nprominence. It becomes visible in the suffering of men, which is now\nintroduced, partly through chance and error, which appear as the rulers of\nthe world, personified as fate, on account of their insidiousness, which\neven reaches the appearance of design; partly it proceeds from man\nhimself, through the self-mortifying efforts of a few, through the\nwickedness and perversity of most. It is one and the same will that lives\nand appears in them all, but whose phenomena fight against each other and\ndestroy each other. In one individual it appears powerfully, in another\nmore weakly; in one more subject to reason, and softened by the light of\nknowledge, in another less so, till at last, in some single case, this\nknowledge, purified and heightened by suffering itself, reaches the point\nat which the phenomenon, the veil of Mâya, no longer deceives it. It sees\nthrough the form of the phenomenon, the _principium individuationis_. The\negoism which rests on this perishes with it, so that now the _motives_\nthat were so powerful before have lost their might, and instead of them\nthe complete knowledge of the nature of the world, which has a _quieting_\neffect on the will, produces resignation, the surrender not merely of\nlife, but of the very will to live. Thus we see in tragedies the noblest\nmen, after long conflict and suffering, at last renounce the ends they\nhave so keenly followed, and all the pleasures of life for ever, or else\nfreely and joyfully surrender life itself. So is it with the steadfast\nprince of Calderon; with Gretchen in “Faust;” with Hamlet, whom his friend\nHoratio would willingly follow, but is bade remain a while, and in this\nharsh world draw his breath in pain, to tell the story of Hamlet, and\nclear his memory; so also is it with the Maid of Orleans, the Bride of\nMessina; they all die purified by suffering, _i.e._, after the will to\nlive which was formerly in them is dead. In the “Mohammed” of Voltaire\nthis is actually expressed in the concluding words which the dying Palmira\naddresses to Mohammad: “The world is for tyrants: live!” On the other\nhand, the demand for so-called poetical justice rests on entire\nmisconception of the nature of tragedy, and, indeed, of the nature of the\nworld itself. It boldly appears in all its dulness in the criticisms which\nDr. Samuel Johnson made on particular plays of Shakespeare, for he very\nnaïvely laments its entire absence. And its absence is certainly obvious,\nfor in what has Ophelia, Desdemona, or Cordelia offended? But only the\ndull, optimistic, Protestant-rationalistic, or peculiarly Jewish view of\nlife will make the demand for poetical justice, and find satisfaction in\nit. The true sense of tragedy is the deeper insight, that it is not his\nown individual sins that the hero atones for, but original sin, _i.e._,\nthe crime of existence itself:\n\n    “Pues el delito mayor\n    Del hombre es haber nacido;”\n\n    (“For the greatest crime of man\n    Is that he was born;”)\n\nas Calderon exactly expresses it.\n\nI shall allow myself only one remark, more closely concerning the\ntreatment of tragedy. The representation of a great misfortune is alone\nessential to tragedy. But the many different ways in which this is\nintroduced by the poet may be brought under three specific conceptions. It\nmay happen by means of a character of extraordinary wickedness, touching\nthe utmost limits of possibility, who becomes the author of the\nmisfortune; examples of this kind are Richard III., Iago in “Othello,”\nShylock in “The Merchant of Venice,” Franz Moor, Phædra of Euripides,\nCreon in the “Antigone,” &c., &c. Secondly, it may happen through blind\nfate, _i.e._, chance and error; a true pattern of this kind is the Œdipus\nRex of Sophocles, the “Trachiniæ” also; and in general most of the\ntragedies of the ancients belong to this class. Among modern tragedies,\n“Romeo and Juliet,” “Tancred” by Voltaire, and “The Bride of Messina,” are\nexamples. Lastly, the misfortune may be brought about by the mere position\nof the _dramatis personæ_ with regard to each other, through their\nrelations; so that there is no need either for a tremendous error or an\nunheard-of accident, nor yet for a character whose wickedness reaches the\nlimits of human possibility; but characters of ordinary morality, under\ncircumstances such as often occur, are so situated with regard to each\nother that their position compels them, knowingly and with their eyes\nopen, to do each other the greatest injury, without any one of them being\nentirely in the wrong. This last kind of tragedy seems to me far to\nsurpass the other two, for it shows us the greatest misfortune, not as an\nexception, not as something occasioned by rare circumstances or monstrous\ncharacters, but as arising easily and of itself out of the actions and\ncharacters of men, indeed almost as essential to them, and thus brings it\nterribly near to us. In the other two kinds we may look on the prodigious\nfate and the horrible wickedness as terrible powers which certainly\nthreaten us, but only from afar, which we may very well escape without\ntaking refuge in renunciation. But in the last kind of tragedy we see that\nthose powers which destroy happiness and life are such that their path to\nus also is open at every moment; we see the greatest sufferings brought\nabout by entanglements that our fate might also partake of, and through\nactions that perhaps we also are capable of performing, and so could not\ncomplain of injustice; then shuddering we feel ourselves already in the\nmidst of hell. This last kind of tragedy is also the most difficult of\nachievement; for the greatest effect has to be produced in it with the\nleast use of means and causes of movement, merely through the position and\ndistribution of the characters; therefore even in many of the best\ntragedies this difficulty is evaded. Yet one tragedy may be referred to as\na perfect model of this kind, a tragedy which in other respects is far\nsurpassed by more than one work of the same great master; it is “Clavigo.”\n“Hamlet” belongs to a certain extent to this class, as far as the relation\nof Hamlet to Laertes and Ophelia is concerned. “Wallenstein” has also this\nexcellence. “Faust” belongs entirely to this class, if we regard the\nevents connected with Gretchen and her brother as the principal action;\nalso the “Cid” of Corneille, only that it lacks the tragic conclusion,\nwhile on the contrary the analogous relation of Max to Thecla has it.(61)",

    "page_content": "that is suitable to our point of view, beginning with architecture, the\npeculiar end of which is to elucidate the objectification of will at the\nlowest grades of its visibility, in which it shows itself as the dumb\nunconscious tendency of the mass in accordance with laws, and yet already\nreveals a breach of the unity of will with itself in a conflict between\ngravity and rigidity—and ending with the consideration of tragedy, which\npresents to us at the highest grades of the objectification of will this\nvery conflict with itself in terrible magnitude and distinctness; we find\nthat there is still another fine art which has been excluded from our\nconsideration, and had to be excluded, for in the systematic connection of\nour exposition there was no fitting place for it—I mean _music_. It stands\nalone, quite cut off from all the other arts. In it we do not recognise\nthe copy or repetition of any Idea of existence in the world. Yet it is\nsuch a great and exceedingly noble art, its effect on the inmost nature of\nman is so powerful, and it is so entirely and deeply understood by him in\nhis inmost consciousness as a perfectly universal language, the\ndistinctness of which surpasses even that of the perceptible world itself,\nthat we certainly have more to look for in it than an _exercitum\narithmeticæ occultum nescientis se numerare animi_,(62) which Leibnitz\ncalled it. Yet he was perfectly right, as he considered only its immediate\nexternal significance, its form. But if it were nothing more, the\nsatisfaction which it affords would be like that which we feel when a sum\nin arithmetic comes out right, and could not be that intense pleasure with\nwhich we see the deepest recesses of our nature find utterance. From our\nstandpoint, therefore, at which the æsthetic effect is the criterion, we\nmust attribute to music a far more serious and deep significance,\nconnected with the inmost nature of the world and our own self, and in\nreference to which the arithmetical proportions, to which it may be\nreduced, are related, not as the thing signified, but merely as the sign.\nThat in some sense music must be related to the world as the\nrepresentation to the thing represented, as the copy to the original, we\nmay conclude from the analogy of the other arts, all of which possess this\ncharacter, and affect us on the whole in the same way as it does, only\nthat the effect of music is stronger, quicker, more necessary and\ninfallible. Further, its representative relation to the world must be very\ndeep, absolutely true, and strikingly accurate, because it is instantly\nunderstood by every one, and has the appearance of a certain\ninfallibility, because its form may be reduced to perfectly definite rules\nexpressed in numbers, from which it cannot free itself without entirely\nceasing to be music. Yet the point of comparison between music and the\nworld, the respect in which it stands to the world in the relation of a\ncopy or repetition, is very obscure. Men have practised music in all ages\nwithout being able to account for this; content to understand it directly,\nthey renounce all claim to an abstract conception of this direct\nunderstanding itself.\n\nI gave my mind entirely up to the impression of music in all its forms,\nand then returned to reflection and the system of thought expressed in the\npresent work, and thus I arrived at an explanation of the inner nature of\nmusic and of the nature of its imitative relation to the world—which from\nanalogy had necessarily to be presupposed—an explanation which is quite\nsufficient for myself, and satisfactory to my investigation, and which\nwill doubtless be equally evident to any one who has followed me thus far\nand has agreed with my view of the world. Yet I recognise the fact that it\nis essentially impossible to prove this explanation, for it assumes and\nestablishes a relation of music, as idea, to that which from its nature\ncan never be idea, and music will have to be regarded as the copy of an\noriginal which can never itself be directly presented as idea. I can\ntherefore do no more than state here, at the conclusion of this third\nbook, which has been principally devoted to the consideration of the arts,\nthe explanation of the marvellous art of music which satisfies myself, and\nI must leave the acceptance or denial of my view to the effect produced\nupon each of my readers both by music itself and by the whole system of\nthought communicated in this work. Moreover, I regard it as necessary, in\norder to be able to assent with full conviction to the exposition of the\nsignificance of music I am about to give, that one should often listen to\nmusic with constant reflection upon my theory concerning it, and for this\nagain it is necessary to be very familiar with the whole of my system of\nthought.\n\nThe (Platonic) Ideas are the adequate objectification of will. To excite\nor suggest the knowledge of these by means of the representation of\nparticular things (for works of art themselves are always representations\nof particular things) is the end of all the other arts, which can only be\nattained by a corresponding change in the knowing subject. Thus all these\narts objectify the will indirectly only by means of the Ideas; and since\nour world is nothing but the manifestation of the Ideas in multiplicity,\nthough their entrance into the _principium individuationis_ (the form of\nthe knowledge possible for the individual as such), music also, since it\npasses over the Ideas, is entirely independent of the phenomenal world,\nignores it altogether, could to a certain extent exist if there was no\nworld at all, which cannot be said of the other arts. Music is as _direct_\nan objectification and copy of the whole _will_ as the world itself, nay,\neven as the Ideas, whose multiplied manifestation constitutes the world of\nindividual things. Music is thus by no means like the other arts, the copy\nof the Ideas, but the _copy of the will itself_, whose objectivity the\nIdeas are. This is why the effect of music is so much more powerful and\npenetrating than that of the other arts, for they speak only of shadows,\nbut it speaks of the thing itself. Since, however, it is the same will\nwhich objectifies itself both in the Ideas and in music, though in quite\ndifferent ways, there must be, not indeed a direct likeness, but yet a\nparallel, an analogy, between music and the Ideas whose manifestation in\nmultiplicity and incompleteness is the visible world. The establishing of\nthis analogy will facilitate, as an illustration, the understanding of\nthis exposition, which is so difficult on account of the obscurity of the\nsubject.\n\nI recognise in the deepest tones of harmony, in the bass, the lowest\ngrades of the objectification of will, unorganised nature, the mass of the\nplanet. It is well known that all the high notes which are easily sounded,\nand die away more quickly, are produced by the vibration in their vicinity\nof the deep bass-notes. When, also, the low notes sound, the high notes\nalways sound faintly, and it is a law of harmony that only those high\nnotes may accompany a bass-note which actually already sound along with it\nof themselves (its _sons harmoniques_) on account of its vibration. This\nis analogous to the fact that the whole of the bodies and organisations of\nnature must be regarded as having come into existence through gradual\ndevelopment out of the mass of the planet; this is both their supporter\nand their source, and the same relation subsists between the high notes\nand the bass. There is a limit of depth, below which no sound is audible.\nThis corresponds to the fact that no matter can be perceived without form\nand quality, _i.e._, without the manifestation of a force which cannot be\nfurther explained, in which an Idea expresses itself, and, more generally,\nthat no matter can be entirely without will. Thus, as a certain pitch is\ninseparable from the note as such, so a certain grade of the manifestation\nof will is inseparable from matter. Bass is thus, for us, in harmony what\nunorganised nature, the crudest mass, upon which all rests, and from which\neverything originates and develops, is in the world. Now, further, in the\nwhole of the complemental parts which make up the harmony between the bass\nand the leading voice singing the melody, I recognise the whole gradation\nof the Ideas in which the will objectifies itself. Those nearer to the\nbass are the lower of these grades, the still unorganised, but yet\nmanifold phenomenal things; the higher represent to me the world of plants\nand beasts. The definite intervals of the scale are parallel to the\ndefinite grades of the objectification of will, the definite species in\nnature. The departure from the arithmetical correctness of the intervals,\nthrough some temperament, or produced by the key selected, is analogous to\nthe departure of the individual from the type of the species. Indeed, even\nthe impure discords, which give no definite interval, may be compared to\nthe monstrous abortions produced by beasts of two species, or by man and\nbeast. But to all these bass and complemental parts which make up the\n_harmony_ there is wanting that connected progress which belongs only to\nthe high voice singing the melody, and it alone moves quickly and lightly\nin modulations and runs, while all these others have only a slower\nmovement without a connection in each part for itself. The deep bass moves\nmost slowly, the representative of the crudest mass. Its rising and\nfalling occurs only by large intervals, in thirds, fourths, fifths, never\nby _one_ tone, unless it is a base inverted by double counterpoint. This\nslow movement is also physically essential to it; a quick run or shake in\nthe low notes cannot even be imagined. The higher complemental parts,\nwhich are parallel to animal life, move more quickly, but yet without\nmelodious connection and significant progress. The disconnected course of\nall the complemental parts, and their regulation by definite laws, is\nanalogous to the fact that in the whole irrational world, from the crystal\nto the most perfect animal, no being has a connected consciousness of its\nown which would make its life into a significant whole, and none\nexperiences a succession of mental developments, none perfects itself by\nculture, but everything exists always in the same way according to its\nkind, determined by fixed law. Lastly, in the _melody_, in the high,\nsinging, principal voice leading the whole and progressing with\nunrestrained freedom, in the unbroken significant connection of _one_\nthought from beginning to end representing a whole, I recognise the\nhighest grade of the objectification of will, the intellectual life and\neffort of man. As he alone, because endowed with reason, constantly looks\nbefore and after on the path of his actual life and its innumerable\npossibilities, and so achieves a course of life which is intellectual, and\ntherefore connected as a whole; corresponding to this, I say, the _melody_\nhas significant intentional connection from beginning to end. It records,\ntherefore, the history of the intellectually enlightened will. This will\nexpresses itself in the actual world as the series of its deeds; but\nmelody says more, it records the most secret history of this\nintellectually-enlightened will, pictures every excitement, every effort,\nevery movement of it, all that which the reason collects under the wide\nand negative concept of feeling, and which it cannot apprehend further\nthrough its abstract concepts. Therefore it has always been said that\nmusic is the language of feeling and of passion, as words are the language\nof reason. Plato explains it as ἡ των μελων κινησις μεμιμημενη, εν τοις\nπαθημασιν ὁταν ψυχη γινηται (_melodiarum motus, animi affectus imitans_),\nDe Leg. vii.; and also Aristotle says: δια τι οἱ ρυθμοι και τα μελη, φωνη\nουσα, ηθεσιν εοικε (_cur numeri musici et modi, qui voces sunt, moribus\nsimiles sese exhibent?_): Probl. c. 19.\n\nNow the nature of man consists in this, that his will strives, is\nsatisfied and strives anew, and so on for ever. Indeed, his happiness and\nwell-being consist simply in the quick transition from wish to\nsatisfaction, and from satisfaction to a new wish. For the absence of\nsatisfaction is suffering, the empty longing for a new wish, languor,\n_ennui_. And corresponding to this the nature of melody is a constant\ndigression and deviation from the key-note in a thousand ways, not only to\nthe harmonious intervals to the third and dominant, but to every tone, to\nthe dissonant sevenths and to the superfluous degrees; yet there always\nfollows a constant return to the key-note. In all these deviations melody\nexpresses the multifarious efforts of will, but always its satisfaction\nalso by the final return to an harmonious interval, and still more, to the\nkey-note. The composition of melody, the disclosure in it of all the\ndeepest secrets of human willing and feeling, is the work of genius, whose\naction, which is more apparent here than anywhere else, lies far from all\nreflection and conscious intention, and may be called an inspiration. The\nconception is here, as everywhere in art, unfruitful. The composer reveals\nthe inner nature of the world, and expresses the deepest wisdom in a\nlanguage which his reason does not understand; as a person under the\ninfluence of mesmerism tells things of which he has no conception when he\nawakes. Therefore in the composer, more than in any other artist, the man\nis entirely separated and distinct from the artist. Even in the\nexplanation of this wonderful art, the concept shows its poverty and\nlimitation. I shall try, however, to complete our analogy. As quick\ntransition from wish to satisfaction, and from satisfaction to a new wish,\nis happiness and well-being, so quick melodies without great deviations\nare cheerful; slow melodies, striking painful discords, and only winding\nback through many bars to the keynote are, as analogous to the delayed and\nhardly won satisfaction, sad. The delay of the new excitement of will,\nlanguor, could have no other expression than the sustained keynote, the\neffect of which would soon be unbearable; very monotonous and unmeaning\nmelodies approach this effect. The short intelligible subjects of quick\ndance-music seem to speak only of easily attained common pleasure. On the\nother hand, the _Allegro maestoso_, in elaborate movements, long passages,\nand wide deviations, signifies a greater, nobler effort towards a more\ndistant end, and its final attainment. The _Adagio_ speaks of the pain of\na great and noble effort which despises all trifling happiness. But how\nwonderful is the effect of the _minor_ and _major_! How astounding that\nthe change of half a tone, the entrance of a minor third instead of a\nmajor, at once and inevitably forces upon us an anxious painful feeling,\nfrom which again we are just as instantaneously delivered by the major.\nThe _Adagio_ lengthens in the minor the expression of the keenest pain,\nand becomes even a convulsive wail. Dance-music in the minor seems to\nindicate the failure of that trifling happiness which we ought rather to\ndespise, seems to speak of the attainment of a lower end with toil and\ntrouble. The inexhaustibleness of possible melodies corresponds to the\ninexhaustibleness of Nature in difference of individuals, physiognomies,\nand courses of life. The transition from one key to an entirely different\none, since it altogether breaks the connection with what went before, is\nlike death, for the individual ends in it; but the will which appeared in\nthis individual lives after him as before him, appearing in other\nindividuals, whose consciousness, however, has no connection with his.\n\nBut it must never be forgotten, in the investigation of all these\nanalogies I have pointed out, that music has no direct, but merely an\nindirect relation to them, for it never expresses the phenomenon, but only\nthe inner nature, the in-itself of all phenomena, the will itself. It does\nnot therefore express this or that particular and definite joy, this or\nthat sorrow, or pain, or horror, or delight, or merriment, or peace of\nmind; but joy, sorrow, pain, horror, delight, merriment, peace of mind\n_themselves_, to a certain extent in the abstract, their essential nature,\nwithout accessories, and therefore without their motives. Yet we\ncompletely understand them in this extracted quintessence. Hence it arises\nthat our imagination is so easily excited by music, and now seeks to give\nform to that invisible yet actively moved spirit-world which speaks to us\ndirectly, and clothe it with flesh and blood, _i.e._, to embody it in an\nanalogous example. This is the origin of the song with words, and finally\nof the opera, the text of which should therefore never forsake that\nsubordinate position in order to make itself the chief thing and the music\na mere means of expressing it, which is a great misconception and a piece\nof utter perversity; for music always expresses only the quintessence of\nlife and its events, never these themselves, and therefore their\ndifferences do not always affect it. It is precisely this universality,\nwhich belongs exclusively to it, together with the greatest\ndeterminateness, that gives music the high worth which it has as the\npanacea for all our woes. Thus, if music is too closely united to the\nwords, and tries to form itself according to the events, it is striving to\nspeak a language which is not its own. No one has kept so free from this\nmistake as Rossini; therefore his music speaks _its own language_ so\ndistinctly and purely that it requires no words, and produces its full\neffect when rendered by instruments alone.\n\nAccording to all this, we may regard the phenomenal world, or nature, and\nmusic as two different expressions of the same thing, which is therefore\nitself the only medium of their analogy, so that a knowledge of it is\ndemanded in order to understand that analogy. Music, therefore, if\nregarded as an expression of the world, is in the highest degree a\nuniversal language, which is related indeed to the universality of\nconcepts, much as they are related to the particular things. Its\nuniversality, however, is by no means that empty universality of\nabstraction, but quite of a different kind, and is united with thorough\nand distinct definiteness. In this respect it resembles geometrical\nfigures and numbers, which are the universal forms of all possible objects\nof experience and applicable to them all _a priori_, and yet are not\nabstract but perceptible and thoroughly determined. All possible efforts,\nexcitements, and manifestations of will, all that goes on in the heart of\nman and that reason includes in the wide, negative concept of feeling, may\nbe expressed by the infinite number of possible melodies, but always in\nthe universal, in the mere form, without the material, always according to\nthe thing-in-itself, not the phenomenon, the inmost soul, as it were, of\nthe phenomenon, without the body. This deep relation which music has to\nthe true nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable music\nplayed to any scene, action, event, or surrounding seems to disclose to us\nits most secret meaning, and appears as the most accurate and distinct\ncommentary upon it. This is so truly the case, that whoever gives himself\nup entirely to the impression of a symphony, seems to see all the possible\nevents of life and the world take place in himself, yet if he reflects, he\ncan find no likeness between the music and the things that passed before\nhis mind. For, as we have said, music is distinguished from all the other\narts by the fact that it is not a copy of the phenomenon, or, more\naccurately, the adequate objectivity of will, but is the direct copy of\nthe will itself, and therefore exhibits itself as the metaphysical to\neverything physical in the world, and as the thing-in-itself to every\nphenomenon. We might, therefore, just as well call the world embodied\nmusic as embodied will; and this is the reason why music makes every\npicture, and indeed every scene of real life and of the world, at once\nappear with higher significance, certainly all the more in proportion as\nits melody is analogous to the inner spirit of the given phenomenon. It\nrests upon this that we are able to set a poem to music as a song, or a\nperceptible representation as a pantomime, or both as an opera. Such\nparticular pictures of human life, set to the universal language of music,\nare never bound to it or correspond to it with stringent necessity; but\nthey stand to it only in the relation of an example chosen at will to a\ngeneral concept. In the determinateness of the real, they represent that\nwhich music expresses in the universality of mere form. For melodies are\nto a certain extent, like general concepts, an abstraction from the\nactual. This actual world, then, the world of particular things, affords\nthe object of perception, the special and individual, the particular case,\nboth to the universality of the concepts and to the universality of the\nmelodies. But these two universalities are in a certain respect opposed to\neach other; for the concepts contain particulars only as the first forms\nabstracted from perception, as it were, the separated shell of things;\nthus they are, strictly speaking, _abstracta_; music, on the other hand,\ngives the inmost kernel which precedes all forms, or the heart of things.\nThis relation may be very well expressed in the language of the schoolmen\nby saying the concepts are the _universalia post rem_, but music gives the\n_universalia ante rem_, and the real world the _universalia in re_. To the\nuniversal significance of a melody to which a poem has been set, it is\nquite possible to set other equally arbitrarily selected examples of the\nuniversal expressed in this poem corresponding to the significance of the\nmelody in the same degree. This is why the same composition is suitable to\nmany verses; and this is also what makes the _vaudeville_ possible. But\nthat in general a relation is possible between a composition and a\nperceptible representation rests, as we have said, upon the fact that both\nare simply different expressions of the same inner being of the world.\nWhen now, in the particular case, such a relation is actually given, that\nis to say, when the composer has been able to express in the universal\nlanguage of music the emotions of will which constitute the heart of an\nevent, then the melody of the song, the music of the opera, is expressive.\nBut the analogy discovered by the composer between the two must have\nproceeded from the direct knowledge of the nature of the world unknown to\nhis reason, and must not be an imitation produced with conscious intention\nby means of conceptions, otherwise the music does not express the inner\nnature of the will itself, but merely gives an inadequate imitation of its\nphenomenon. All specially imitative music does this; for example, “The\nSeasons,” by Haydn; also many passages of his “Creation,” in which\nphenomena of the external world are directly imitated; also all\nbattle-pieces. Such music is entirely to be rejected.\n\nThe unutterable depth of all music by virtue of which it floats through\nour consciousness as the vision of a paradise firmly believed in yet ever\ndistant from us, and by which also it is so fully understood and yet so\ninexplicable, rests on the fact that it restores to us all the emotions of\nour inmost nature, but entirely without reality and far removed from their\npain. So also the seriousness which is essential to it, which excludes the\nabsurd from its direct and peculiar province, is to be explained by the\nfact that its object is not the idea, with reference to which alone\ndeception and absurdity are possible; but its object is directly the will,\nand this is essentially the most serious of all things, for it is that on\nwhich all depends. How rich in content and full of significance the\nlanguage of music is, we see from the repetitions, as well as the _Da\ncapo_, the like of which would be unbearable in works composed in a\nlanguage of words, but in music are very appropriate and beneficial, for,\nin order to comprehend it fully, we must hear it twice.\n\nIn the whole of this exposition of music I have been trying to bring out\nclearly that it expresses in a perfectly universal language, in a\nhomogeneous material, mere tones, and with the greatest determinateness\nand truth, the inner nature, the in-itself of the world, which we think\nunder the concept of will, because will is its most distinct\nmanifestation. Further, according to my view and contention, philosophy is\nnothing but a complete and accurate repetition or expression of the nature\nof the world in very general concepts, for only in such is it possible to\nget a view of that whole nature which will everywhere be adequate and\napplicable. Thus, whoever has followed me and entered into my mode of\nthought, will not think it so very paradoxical if I say, that supposing it\nwere possible to give a perfectly accurate, complete explanation of music,\nextending even to particulars, that is to say, a detailed repetition in\nconcepts of what it expresses, this would also be a sufficient repetition\nand explanation of the world in concepts, or at least entirely parallel to\nsuch an explanation, and thus it would be the true philosophy.\nConsequently the saying of Leibnitz quoted above, which is quite accurate\nfrom a lower standpoint, may be parodied in the following way to suit our\nhigher view of music: _Musica est exercitium metaphysices occultum\nnescientis se philosophari animi_; for _scire_, to know, always means to\nhave fixed in abstract concepts. But further, on account of the truth of\nthe saying of Leibnitz, which is confirmed in various ways, music,\nregarded apart from its æsthetic or inner significance, and looked at\nmerely externally and purely empirically, is simply the means of\ncomprehending directly and in the concrete large numbers and complex\nrelations of numbers, which otherwise we could only know indirectly by\nfixing them in concepts. Therefore by the union of these two very\ndifferent but correct views of music we may arrive at a conception of the\npossibility of a philosophy of number, such as that of Pythagoras and of\nthe Chinese in Y-King, and then interpret in this sense the saying of the\nPythagoreans which Sextus Empiricus quotes (adv. Math., L. vii.): τῳ\nαριθμῳ δε τα παντ᾽ επεοικεν (_numero cuncta assimilantur_). And if,\nfinally, we apply this view to the interpretation of harmony and melody\ngiven above, we shall find that a mere moral philosophy without an\nexplanation of Nature, such as Socrates wanted to introduce, is precisely\nanalogous to a mere melody without harmony, which Rousseau exclusively\ndesired; and, in opposition to this mere physics and metaphysics without\nethics, will correspond to mere harmony without melody. Allow me to add to\nthese cursory observations a few more remarks concerning the analogy of\nmusic with the phenomenal world. We found in the second book that the\nhighest grade of the objectification of will, man, could not appear alone\nand isolated, but presupposed the grades below him, as these again\npresupposed the grades lower still. In the same way music, which directly\nobjectifies the will, just as the world does, is complete only in full\nharmony. In order to achieve its full effect, the high leading voice of\nthe melody requires the accompaniment of all the other voices, even to the\nlowest bass, which is to be regarded as the origin of all. The melody\nitself enters as an integral part into the harmony, as the harmony enters\ninto it, and only thus, in the full harmonious whole, music expresses what\nit aims at expressing. Thus also the one will outside of time finds its\nfull objectification only in the complete union of all the steps which\nreveal its nature in the innumerable ascending grades of distinctness. The\nfollowing analogy is also very remarkable. We have seen in the preceding\nbook that notwithstanding the self-adaptation of all the phenomena of will\nto each other as regards their species, which constitutes their\nteleological aspect, there yet remains an unceasing conflict between those\nphenomena as individuals, which is visible at every grade, and makes the\nworld a constant battle-field of all those manifestations of one and the\nsame will, whose inner contradiction with itself becomes visible through\nit. In music also there is something corresponding to this. A complete,\npure, harmonious system of tones is not only physically but arithmetically\nimpossible. The numbers themselves by which the tones are expressed have\ninextricable irrationality. There is no scale in which, when it is\ncounted, every fifth will be related to the keynote as 2 to 3, every major\nthird as 4 to 5, every minor third as 5 to 6, and so on. For if they are\ncorrectly related to the keynote, they can no longer be so to each other;\nbecause, for example, the fifth must be the minor third to the third, &c.\nFor the notes of the scale may be compared to actors who must play now one\npart, now another. Therefore a perfectly accurate system of music cannot\neven be thought, far less worked out; and on this account all possible\nmusic deviates from perfect purity; it can only conceal the discords\nessential to it by dividing them among all the notes, _i.e._, by\ntemperament. On this see Chladni’s “Akustik,” § 30, and his “Kurze\nUebersicht der Schall- und Klanglehre.”(63)\n\nI might still have something to say about the way in which music is\nperceived, namely, in and through time alone, with absolute exclusion of\nspace, and also apart from the influence of the knowledge of causality,\nthus without understanding; for the tones make the æsthetic impression as\neffect, and without obliging us to go back to their causes, as in the case\nof perception. I do not wish, however, to lengthen this discussion, as I\nhave perhaps already gone too much into detail with regard to some things\nin this Third Book, or have dwelt too much on particulars. But my aim made\nit necessary, and it will be the less disapproved if the importance and\nhigh worth of art, which is seldom sufficiently recognised, be kept in\nmind. For if, according to our view, the whole visible world is just the\nobjectification, the mirror, of the will, conducting it to knowledge of\nitself, and, indeed, as we shall soon see, to the possibility of its\ndeliverance; and if, at the same time, the world as idea, if we regard it\nin isolation, and, freeing ourselves from all volition, allow it alone to\ntake possession of our consciousness, is the most joy-giving and the only\ninnocent side of life; we must regard art as the higher ascent, the more\ncomplete development of all this, for it achieves essentially just what is\nachieved by the visible world itself, only with greater concentration,\nmore perfectly, with intention and intelligence, and therefore may be\ncalled, in the full significance of the word, the flower of life. If the\nwhole world as idea is only the visibility of will, the work of art is to\nrender this visibility more distinct. It is the _camera obscura_ which\nshows the objects more purely, and enables us to survey them and\ncomprehend them better. It is the play within the play, the stage upon the\nstage in “Hamlet.”\n\nThe pleasure we receive from all beauty, the consolation which art\naffords, the enthusiasm of the artist, which enables him to forget the\ncares of life,—the latter an advantage of the man of genius over other\nmen, which alone repays him for the suffering that increases in proportion\nto the clearness of consciousness, and for the desert loneliness among men\nof a different race,—all this rests on the fact that the in-itself of\nlife, the will, existence itself, is, as we shall see farther on, a\nconstant sorrow, partly miserable, partly terrible; while, on the\ncontrary, as idea alone, purely contemplated, or copied by art, free from\npain, it presents to us a drama full of significance. This purely knowable\nside of the world, and the copy of it in any art, is the element of the\nartist. He is chained to the contemplation of the play, the\nobjectification of will; he remains beside it, does not get tired of\ncontemplating it and representing it in copies; and meanwhile he bears\nhimself the cost of the production of that play, _i.e._, he himself is the\nwill which objectifies itself, and remains in constant suffering. That\npure, true, and deep knowledge of the inner nature of the world becomes\nnow for him an end in itself: he stops there. Therefore it does not become\nto him a quieter of the will, as, we shall see in the next book, it does\nin the case of the saint who has attained to resignation; it does not\ndeliver him for ever from life, but only at moments, and is therefore not\nfor him a path out of life, but only an occasional consolation in it, till\nhis power, increased by this contemplation and at last tired of the play,\nlays hold on the real. The St. Cecilia of Raphael may be regarded as a\nrepresentation of this transition. To the real, then, we now turn in the\nfollowing book.\n\nFOURTH BOOK. THE WORLD AS WILL.\n\nSecond Aspect.

    "page_content": "it relates to the action of men, the matter which concerns every one\ndirectly and can be foreign or indifferent to none. It is indeed so\ncharacteristic of the nature of man to relate everything else to action,\nthat in every systematic investigation he will always treat the part that\nhas to do with action as the result or outcome of the whole work, so far,\nat least, as it interests him, and will therefore give his most serious\nattention to this part, even if to no other. In this respect the following\npart of our work would, in ordinary language, be called practical\nphilosophy, in opposition to the theoretical, which has occupied us\nhitherto. But, in my opinion, all philosophy is theoretical, because it is\nessential to it that it should retain a purely contemplative attitude, and\nshould investigate, not prescribe. To become, on the contrary, practical,\nto guide conduct, to transform character, are old claims, which with\nfuller insight it ought finally to give up. For here, where the worth or\nworthlessness of an existence, where salvation or damnation are in\nquestion, the dead conceptions of philosophy do not decide the matter, but\nthe inmost nature of man himself, the Dæmon that guides him and that has\nnot chosen him, but been chosen by him, as Plato would say; his\nintelligible character, as Kant expresses himself. Virtue cannot be taught\nany more than genius; indeed, for it the concept is just as unfruitful as\nit is in art, and in both cases can only be used as an instrument. It\nwould, therefore, be just as absurd to expect that our moral systems and\nethics will produce virtuous, noble, and holy men, as that our æsthetics\nwill produce poets, painters, and musicians.\n\nPhilosophy can never do more than interpret and explain what is given. It\ncan only bring to distinct abstract knowledge of the reason the nature of\nthe world which in the concrete, that is, as feeling, expresses itself\ncomprehensibly to every one. This, however, it does in every possible\nreference and from every point of view. Now, as this attempt has been made\nfrom other points of view in the three preceding books with the generality\nthat is proper to philosophy, in this book the action of men will be\nconsidered in the same way; and this side of the world might, indeed, be\nconsidered the most important of all, not only subjectively, as I remarked\nabove, but also objectively. In considering it I shall faithfully adhere\nto the method I have hitherto followed, and shall support myself by\npresupposing all that has already been advanced. There is, indeed, just\none thought which forms the content of this whole work. I have endeavoured\nto work it out in all other spheres, and I shall now do so with regard to\nhuman action. I shall then have done all that is in my power to\ncommunicate it as fully as possible.\n\nThe given point of view, and the method of treatment announced, are\nthemselves sufficient to indicate that in this ethical book no precepts,\nno doctrine of duty must be looked for; still less will a general moral\nprinciple be given, an universal receipt, as it were, for the production\nof all the virtues. Neither shall we talk of an “_absolute ought_,” for\nthis contains a contradiction, as is explained in the Appendix; nor yet of\na “_law of freedom_,” which is in the same position. In general, we shall\nnot speak at all of “ought,” for this is how one speaks to children and to\nnations still in their childhood, but not to those who have appropriated\nall the culture of a full-grown age. It is a palpable contradiction to\ncall the will free, and yet to prescribe laws for it according to which it\nought to will. “Ought to will!”—wooden iron! But it follows from the point\nof view of our system that the will is not only free, but almighty. From\nit proceeds not only its action, but also its world; and as the will is,\nso does its action and its world become. Both are the self-knowledge of\nthe will and nothing more. The will determines itself, and at the same\ntime both its action and its world; for besides it there is nothing, and\nthese are the will itself. Only thus is the will truly autonomous, and\nfrom every other point of view it is heteronomous. Our philosophical\nendeavours can only extend to exhibiting and explaining the action of men\nin its inner nature and content, the various and even opposite maxims,\nwhose living expression it is. This we shall do in connection with the\npreceding portion of our work, and in precisely the same way as we have\nhitherto explained the other phenomena of the world, and have sought to\nbring their inmost nature to distinct abstract knowledge. Our philosophy\nwill maintain the same _immanency_ in the case of action, as in all that\nwe have hitherto considered. Notwithstanding Kant’s great doctrine, it\nwill not attempt to use the forms of the phenomenon, the universal\nexpression of which is the principle of sufficient reason, as a\nleaping-pole to jump over the phenomenon itself, which alone gives meaning\nto these forms, and land in the boundless sphere of empty fictions. But\nthis actual world of experience, in which we are, and which is in us,\nremains both the material and the limits of our consideration: a world\nwhich is so rich in content that even the most searching investigation of\nwhich the human mind is capable could not exhaust it. Since then the real\nworld of experience will never fail to afford material and reality to our\nethical investigations, any more than to those we have already conducted,\nnothing will be less needful than to take refuge in negative conceptions\nvoid of content, and then somehow or other make even ourselves believe\nthat we are saying something when we speak with lifted eyebrows of\n“absolutes,” “infinites,” “supersensibles,” and whatever other mere\nnegations of this sort there may be (ουδεν εστι, η το της στερησεως ονομα,\nμετα αμυδρας επινοιας—_nihil est, nisi negationis nomen, cum obscura\nnotione_.—Jul. or. 5), instead of which it would be shorter to say at once\ncloud-cuckoo-town (νεφελοκοκκυγια): we shall not require to serve up\ncovered empty dishes of this kind. Finally, we shall not in this book, any\nmore than in those which have preceded it, narrate histories and give them\nout as philosophy. For we are of opinion that whoever supposes that the\ninner nature of the world can in any way, however plausibly disguised, be\n_historically_ comprehended, is infinitely far from a philosophical\nknowledge of the world. Yet this is what is supposed whenever a\n“becoming,” or a “having become,” or an “about to become” enters into a\ntheory of the nature of the world, whenever an earlier or a later has the\nleast place in it; and in this way a beginning and an end of the world,\nand the path it pursues between them, is, either openly or disguisedly,\nboth sought for and found, and the individual who philosophises even\nrecognises his own position on that path. Such _historical philosophising_\nin most cases produces a cosmogony which admits of many varieties, or else\na system of emanations, a doctrine of successive disengagements from one\nbeing; or, finally, driven in despair from fruitless efforts upon these\npaths to the last path of all, it takes refuge in the converse doctrine of\na constant becoming, springing up, arising, coming to light out of\ndarkness, out of the hidden ground source or groundlessness, or whatever\nother nonsense of this sort there may be, which is most shortly disposed\nof with the remark that at the present moment a whole eternity, _i.e._, an\nendless time, has already passed, so that everything that can or ought to\nbecome must have already done so. For all such historical philosophy,\nwhatever airs it may give itself, regards _time_ just as if Kant had never\nlived, as a quality of the thing-in-itself, and thus stops at that which\nKant calls the phenomenon in opposition to the thing-in-itself; which\nPlato calls the becoming and never being, in opposition to the being and\nnever becoming; and which, finally, is called in the Indian philosophy the\nweb of Mâya. It is just the knowledge which belongs to the principle of\nsufficient reason, with which no one can penetrate to the inner nature of\nthings, but endlessly pursues phenomena, moving without end or aim, like a\nsquirrel in its wheel, till, tired out at last, he stops at some point or\nother arbitrarily chosen, and now desires to extort respect for it from\nothers also. The genuine philosophical consideration of the world, _i.e._,\nthe consideration that affords us a knowledge of its inner nature, and so\nleads us beyond the phenomenon, is precisely that method which does not\nconcern itself with the whence, the whither, and the why of the world, but\nalways and everywhere demands only the what; the method which considers\nthings not according to any relation, not as becoming and passing away, in\nshort, not according to one of the four forms of the principle of\nsufficient reason; but, on the contrary, just that which remains when all\nthat belongs to the form of knowledge proper to that principle has been\nabstracted, the inner nature of the world, which always appears unchanged\nin all the relations, but is itself never subject to them, and has the\nIdeas of the world as its object or material. From such knowledge as this\nproceeds philosophy, like art, and also, as we shall see in this book,\nthat disposition of mind which alone leads to true holiness and to\ndeliverance from the world.",

    "page_content": "and certain knowledge that the world as idea is the complete mirror of the\nwill, in which it knows itself in ascending grades of distinctness and\ncompleteness, the highest of which is man, whose nature, however, receives\nits complete expression only through the whole connected series of his\nactions. The self-conscious connection of these actions is made possible\nby reason, which enables a man constantly to survey the whole in the\nabstract.\n\nThe will, which, considered purely in itself, is without knowledge, and is\nmerely a blind incessant impulse, as we see it appear in unorganised and\nvegetable nature and their laws, and also in the vegetative part of our\nown life, receives through the addition of the world as idea, which is\ndeveloped in subjection to it, the knowledge of its own willing and of\nwhat it is that it wills. And this is nothing else than the world as idea,\nlife, precisely as it exists. Therefore we called the phenomenal world the\nmirror of the will, its objectivity. And since what the will wills is\nalways life, just because life is nothing but the representation of that\nwilling for the idea, it is all one and a mere pleonism if, instead of\nsimply saying “the will,” we say “the will to live.”\n\nWill is the thing-in-itself, the inner content, the essence of the world.\nLife, the visible world, the phenomenon, is only the mirror of the will.\nTherefore life accompanies the will as inseparably as the shadow\naccompanies the body; and if will exists, so will life, the world, exist.\nLife is, therefore, assured to the will to live; and so long as we are\nfilled with the will to live we need have no fear for our existence, even\nin the presence of death. It is true we see the individual come into being\nand pass away; but the individual is only phenomenal, exists only for the\nknowledge which is bound to the principle of sufficient reason, to the\n_principio individuationis_. Certainly, for this kind of knowledge, the\nindividual receives his life as a gift, rises out of nothing, then suffers\nthe loss of this gift through death, and returns again to nothing. But we\ndesire to consider life philosophically, _i.e._, according to its Ideas,\nand in this sphere we shall find that neither the will, the\nthing-in-itself in all phenomena, nor the subject of knowing, that which\nperceives all phenomena, is affected at all by birth or by death. Birth\nand death belong merely to the phenomenon of will, thus to life; and it is\nessential to this to exhibit itself in individuals which come into being\nand pass away, as fleeting phenomena appearing in the form of\ntime—phenomena of that which in itself knows no time, but must exhibit\nitself precisely in the way we have said, in order to objectify its\npeculiar nature. Birth and death belong in like manner to life, and hold\nthe balance as reciprocal conditions of each other, or, if one likes the\nexpression, as poles of the whole phenomenon of life. The wisest of all\nmythologies, the Indian, expresses this by giving to the very god that\nsymbolises destruction, death (as Brahma, the most sinful and the lowest\ngod of the Trimurti, symbolises generation, coming into being, and Vishnu\nmaintaining or preserving), by giving, I say, to Siva as an attribute not\nonly the necklace of skulls, but also the lingam, the symbol of\ngeneration, which appears here as the counterpart of death, thus\nsignifying that generation and death are essentially correlatives, which\nreciprocally neutralise and annul each other. It was precisely the same\nsentiment that led the Greeks and Romans to adorn their costly sarcophagi,\njust as we see them now, with feasts, dances, marriages, the chase, fights\nof wild beasts, bacchanalians, &c.; thus with representations of the full\nardour of life, which they place before us not only in such revels and\nsports, but also in sensual groups, and even go so far as to represent the\nsexual intercourse of satyrs and goats. Clearly the aim was to point in\nthe most impressive manner away from the death of the mourned individual\nto the immortal life of nature, and thus to indicate, though without\nabstract knowledge, that the whole of nature is the phenomenon and also\nthe fulfilment of the will to live. The form of this phenomenon is time,\nspace, and causality, and by means of these individuation, which carries\nwith it that the individual must come into being and pass away. But this\nno more affects the will to live, of whose manifestation the individual\nis, as it were, only a particular example or specimen, than the death of\nan individual injures the whole of nature. For it is not the individual,\nbut only the species that Nature cares for, and for the preservation of\nwhich she so earnestly strives, providing for it with the utmost\nprodigality through the vast surplus of the seed and the great strength of\nthe fructifying impulse. The individual, on the contrary, neither has nor\ncan have any value for Nature, for her kingdom is infinite time and\ninfinite space, and in these infinite multiplicity of possible\nindividuals. Therefore she is always ready to let the individual fall, and\nhence it is not only exposed to destruction in a thousand ways by the most\ninsignificant accident, but originally destined for it, and conducted\ntowards it by Nature herself from the moment it has served its end of\nmaintaining the species. Thus Nature naïvely expresses the great truth\nthat only the Ideas, not the individuals, have, properly speaking,\nreality, _i.e._, are complete objectivity of the will. Now, since man is\nNature itself, and indeed Nature at the highest grade of its\nself-consciousness, but Nature is only the objectified will to live, the\nman who has comprehended and retained this point of view may well console\nhimself, when contemplating his own death and that of his friends, by\nturning his eyes to the immortal life of Nature, which he himself is. This\nis the significance of Siva with the lingam, and of those ancient\nsarcophagi with their pictures of glowing life, which say to the mourning\nbeholder, _Natura non contristatur_.\n\nThat generation and death are to be regarded as something belonging to\nlife, and essential to this phenomenon of the will, arises also from the\nfact that they both exhibit themselves merely as higher powers of the\nexpression of that in which all the rest of life consists. This is through\nand through nothing else than the constant change of matter in the fixed\npermanence of form; and this is what constitutes the transitoriness of the\nindividual and the permanence of the species. Constant nourishment and\nrenewal differ from generation only in degree, and constant excretion\ndiffers only in degree from death. The first shows itself most simply and\ndistinctly in the plant. The plant is throughout a constant recurrence of\nthe same impulse of its simplest fibre, which groups itself into leaf and\nbranch. It is a systematic aggregate of similar plants supporting each\nother, whose constant reproduction is its single impulse. It ascends to\nthe full satisfaction of this tendency through the grades of its\nmetamorphosis, finally to the blossom and fruit, that compendium of its\nexistence and effort in which it now attains, by a short way, to that\nwhich is its single aim, and at a stroke produces a thousand-fold what, up\ntill then, it effected only in the particular case—the repetition of\nitself. Its earlier growth and development stands in the same relation to\nits fruit as writing stands to printing. With the animal it is clearly\nquite the same. The process of nourishing is a constant reproduction; the\nprocess of reproduction is a higher power of nourishing. The pleasure\nwhich accompanies the act of procreation is a higher power of the\nagreeableness of the sense of life. On the other hand, excretion, the\nconstant exhalation and throwing off of matter, is the same as that which,\nat a higher power, death, is the contrary of generation. And if here we\nare always content to retain the form without lamenting the discarded\nmatter, we ought to bear ourselves in the same way if in death the same\nthing happens, in a higher degree and to the whole, as takes place daily\nand hourly in a partial manner in excretion: if we are indifferent to the\none, we ought not to shrink from the other. Therefore, from this point of\nview, it appears just as perverse to desire the continuance of an\nindividuality which will be replaced by other individuals as to desire the\npermanence of matter which will be replaced by other matter. It appears\njust as foolish to embalm the body as it would be carefully to preserve\nits excrement. As to the individual consciousness which is bound to the\nindividual body, it is absolutely interrupted every day by sleep. Deep\nsleep is, while it lasts, in no way different from death, into which, in\nfact, it often passes continuously, as in the case of freezing to death.\nIt differs only with regard to the future, the awaking. Death is a sleep\nin which individuality is forgotten; everything else wakes again, or\nrather never slept.(64)\n\nAbove all things, we must distinctly recognise that the form of the\nphenomenon of will, the form of life or reality, is really only the\n_present_, not the future nor the past. The latter are only in the\nconception, exist only in the connection of knowledge, so far as it\nfollows the principle of sufficient reason. No man has ever lived in the\npast, and none will live in the future; the _present_ alone is the form of\nall life, and is its sure possession which can never be taken from it. The\npresent always exists, together with its content. Both remain fixed\nwithout wavering, like the rainbow on the waterfall. For life is firm and\ncertain in the will, and the present is firm and certain in life.\nCertainly, if we reflect on the thousands of years that are past, of the\nmillions of men who lived in them, we ask, What were they? what has become\nof them? But, on the other hand, we need only recall our own past life and\nrenew its scenes vividly in our imagination, and then ask again, What was\nall this? what has become of it? As it is with it, so is it with the life\nof those millions. Or should we suppose that the past could receive a new\nexistence because it has been sealed by death? Our own past, the most\nrecent part of it, and even yesterday, is now no more than an empty dream\nof the fancy, and such is the past of all those millions. What was? What\nis? The will, of which life is the mirror, and knowledge free from will,\nwhich beholds it clearly in that mirror. Whoever has not yet recognised\nthis, or will not recognise it, must add to the question asked above as to\nthe fate of past generations of men this question also: Why he, the\nquestioner, is so fortunate as to be conscious of this costly, fleeting,\nand only real present, while those hundreds of generations of men, even\nthe heroes and philosophers of those ages, have sunk into the night of the\npast, and have thus become nothing; but he, his insignificant ego,\nactually exists? or more shortly, though somewhat strangely: Why this now,\nhis now, _is_ just now and _was_ not long ago? Since he asks such strange\nquestions, he regards his existence and his time as independent of each\nother, and the former as projected into the latter. He assumes indeed two\nnows—one which belongs to the object, the other which belongs to the\nsubject, and marvels at the happy accident of their coincidence. But in\ntruth, only the point of contact of the object, the form of which is time,\nwith the subject, which has no mode of the principle of sufficient reason\nas its form, constitutes the present, as is shown in the essay on the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Now all object is the will so far as it\nhas become idea, and the subject is the necessary correlative of the\nobject. But real objects are only in the present; the past and the future\ncontain only conceptions and fancies, therefore the present is the\nessential form of the phenomenon of the will, and inseparable from it. The\npresent alone is that which always exists and remains immovable. That\nwhich, empirically apprehended, is the most transitory of all, presents\nitself to the metaphysical vision, which sees beyond the forms of\nempirical perception, as that which alone endures, the _nunc stans_ of the\nschoolmen. The source and the supporter of its content is the will to live\nor the thing-in-itself,—which we are. That which constantly becomes and\npasses away, in that it has either already been or is still to be, belongs\nto the phenomenon as such on account of its forms, which make coming into\nbeing and passing away possible. Accordingly, we must think:—_Quid\nfuit?_—_Quod est._ _Quid erit?_—_Quod fuit;_ and take it in the strict\nmeaning of the words; thus understand not _simile_ but _idem_. For life is\ncertain to the will, and the present is certain to life. Thus it is that\nevery one can say, “I am once for all lord of the present, and through all\neternity it will accompany me as my shadow: therefore I do not wonder\nwhere it has come from, and how it happens that it is exactly now.” We\nmight compare time to a constantly revolving sphere; the half that was\nalways sinking would be the past, that which was always rising would be\nthe future; but the indivisible point at the top, where the tangent\ntouches, would be the extensionless present. As the tangent does not\nrevolve with the sphere, neither does the present, the point of contact of\nthe object, the form of which is time, with the subject, which has no\nform, because it does not belong to the knowable, but is the condition of\nall that is knowable. Or, time is like an unceasing stream, and the\npresent a rock on which the stream breaks itself, but does not carry away\nwith it. The will, as thing-in-itself, is just as little subordinate to\nthe principle of sufficient reason as the subject of knowledge, which,\nfinally, in a certain regard is the will itself or its expression. And as\nlife, its own phenomenon, is assured to the will, so is the present, the\nsingle form of real life. Therefore we have not to investigate the past\nbefore life, nor the future after death: we have rather to know the\n_present_, the one form in which the will manifests itself.(65) It will\nnot escape from the will, but neither will the will escape from it. If,\ntherefore, life as it is satisfies, whoever affirms it in every way may\nregard it with confidence as endless, and banish the fear of death as an\nillusion that inspires him with the foolish dread that he can ever be\nrobbed of the present, and foreshadows a time in which there is no\npresent; an illusion with regard to time analogous to the illusion with\nregard to space through which every one imagines the position on the globe\nhe happens to occupy as above, and all other places as below. In the same\nway every one links the present to his own individuality, and imagines\nthat all present is extinguished with it; that then past and future might\nbe without a present. But as on the surface of the globe every place is\nabove, so the form of all life is the _present_, and to fear death because\nit robs us of the present, is just as foolish as to fear that we may slip\ndown from the round globe upon which we have now the good fortune to\noccupy the upper surface. The present is the form essential to the\nobjectification of the will. It cuts time, which extends infinitely in\nboth directions, as a mathematical point, and stands immovably fixed, like\nan everlasting mid-day with no cool evening, as the actual sun burns\nwithout intermission, while it only seems to sink into the bosom of night.\nTherefore, if a man fears death as his annihilation, it is just as if he\nwere to think that the sun cries out at evening, “Woe is me! for I go down\ninto eternal night.”(66) And conversely, whoever is oppressed with the\nburden of life, whoever desires life and affirms it, but abhors its\ntorments, and especially can no longer endure the hard lot that has fallen\nto himself, such a man has no deliverance to hope for from death, and\ncannot right himself by suicide. The cool shades of Orcus allure him only\nwith the false appearance of a haven of rest. The earth rolls from day\ninto night, the individual dies, but the sun itself shines without\nintermission, an eternal noon. Life is assured to the will to live; the\nform of life is an endless present, no matter how the individuals, the\nphenomena of the Idea, arise and pass away in time, like fleeting dreams.\nThus even already suicide appears to us as a vain and therefore a foolish\naction; when we have carried our investigation further it will appear to\nus in a still less favourable light.\n\nDogmas change and our knowledge is deceptive; but Nature never errs, her\nprocedure is sure, and she never conceals it. Everything is entirely in\nNature, and Nature is entire in everything. She has her centre in every\nbrute. It has surely found its way into existence, and it will surely find\nits way out of it. In the meantime it lives, fearless and without care, in\nthe presence of annihilation, supported by the consciousness that it is\nNature herself, and imperishable as she is. Man alone carries about with\nhim, in abstract conceptions, the certainty of his death; yet this can\nonly trouble him very rarely, when for a single moment some occasion calls\nit up to his imagination. Against the mighty voice of Nature reflection\ncan do little. In man, as in the brute which does not think, the certainty\nthat springs from his inmost consciousness that he himself is Nature, the\nworld, predominates as a lasting frame of mind; and on account of this no\nman is observably disturbed by the thought of certain and never-distant\ndeath, but lives as if he would live for ever. Indeed this is carried so\nfar that we may say that no one has really a lively conviction of the\ncertainty of his death, otherwise there would be no great difference\nbetween his frame of mind and that of a condemned criminal. Every one\nrecognises that certainty in the abstract and theoretically, but lays it\naside like other theoretical truths which are not applicable to practice,\nwithout really receiving it into his living consciousness. Whoever\ncarefully considers this peculiarity of human character will see that the\npsychological explanations of it, from habit and acquiescence in the\ninevitable, are by no means sufficient, and that its true explanation lies\nin the deeper ground we have given. The same fact explains the\ncircumstance that at all times and among all peoples dogmas of some kind\nor other relating to the continued existence of the individual after death\narise, and are believed in, although the evidence in support of them must\nalways be very insufficient, and the evidence against them forcible and\nvaried. But, in truth, this really requires no proof, but is recognised by\nthe healthy understanding as a fact, and confirmed by the confidence that\nNature never lies any more than she errs, but openly exhibits and naïvely\nexpresses her action and her nature, while only we ourselves obscure it by\nour folly, in order to establish what is agreeable to our limited point of\nview.\n\nBut this that we have brought to clearest consciousness, that although the\nparticular phenomenon of the will has a temporal beginning and end, the\nwill itself as thing-in-itself is not affected by it, nor yet the\ncorrelative of all object, the knowing but never known subject, and that\nlife is always assured to the will to live—this is not to be numbered with\nthe doctrines of immortality. For permanence has no more to do with the\nwill or with the pure subject of knowing, the eternal eye of the world,\nthan transitoriness, for both are predicates that are only valid in time,\nand the will and the pure subject of knowing lie outside time. Therefore\nthe egoism of the individual (this particular phenomenon of will\nenlightened by the subject of knowing) can extract as little nourishment\nand consolation for his wish to endure through endless time from the view\nwe have expressed, as he could from the knowledge that after his death the\nrest of the eternal world would continue to exist, which is just the\nexpression of the same view considered objectively, and therefore\ntemporally. For every individual is transitory only as phenomenon, but as\nthing-in-itself is timeless, and therefore endless. But it is also only as\nphenomenon that an individual is distinguished from the other things of\nthe world; as thing-in-itself he is the will which appears in all, and\ndeath destroys the illusion which separates his consciousness from that of\nthe rest: this is immortality. His exemption from death, which belongs to\nhim only as thing-in-itself, is for the phenomenon one with the\nimmortality of the rest of the external world.(67) Hence also, it arises\nthat although the inward and merely felt consciousness of that which we\nhave raised to distinct knowledge is indeed, as we have said, sufficient\nto prevent the thought of death from poisoning the life of the rational\nbeing, because this consciousness is the basis of that love of life which\nmaintains everything living, and enables it to live on at ease as if there\nwere no such thing as death, so long as it is face to face with life, and\nturns its attention to it, yet it will not prevent the individual from\nbeing seized with the fear of death, and trying in every way to escape\nfrom it, when it presents itself to him in some particular real case, or\neven only in his imagination, and he is compelled to contemplate it. For\njust as, so long as his knowledge was directed to life as such, he was\nobliged to recognise immortality in it, so when death is brought before\nhis eyes, he is obliged to recognise it as that which it is, the temporal\nend of the particular temporal phenomenon. What we fear in death is by no\nmeans the pain, for it lies clearly on this side of death, and, moreover,\nwe often take refuge in death from pain, just as, on the contrary, we\nsometimes endure the most fearful suffering merely to escape death for a\nwhile, although it would be quick and easy. Thus we distinguish pain and\ndeath as two entirely different evils. What we fear in death is the end of\nthe individual, which it openly professes itself to be, and since the\nindividual is a particular objectification of the will to live itself, its\nwhole nature struggles against death. Now when feeling thus exposes us\nhelpless, reason can yet step in and for the most part overcome its\nadverse influence, for it places us upon a higher standpoint, from which\nwe no longer contemplate the particular but the whole. Therefore a\nphilosophical knowledge of the nature of the world, which extended to the\npoint we have now reached in this work but went no farther, could even at\nthis point of view overcome the terror of death in the measure in which\nreflection had power over direct feeling in the given individual. A man\nwho had thoroughly assimilated the truths we have already advanced, but\nhad not come to know, either from his own experience or from a deeper\ninsight, that constant suffering is essential to life, who found\nsatisfaction and all that he wished in life, and could calmly and\ndeliberately desire that his life, as he had hitherto known it, should\nendure for ever or repeat itself ever anew, and whose love of life was so\ngreat that he willingly and gladly accepted all the hardships and miseries\nto which it is exposed for the sake of its pleasures,—such a man would\nstand “with firm-knit bones on the well-rounded, enduring earth,” and\nwould have nothing to fear. Armed with the knowledge we have given him, he\nwould await with indifference the death that hastens towards him on the\nwings of time. He would regard it as a false illusion, an impotent\nspectre, which frightens the weak but has no power over him who knows that\nhe is himself the will of which the whole world is the objectification or\ncopy, and that therefore he is always certain of life, and also of the\npresent, the peculiar and only form of the phenomenon of the will. He\ncould not be terrified by an endless past or future in which he would not\nbe, for this he would regard as the empty delusion of the web of Mâya.\nThus he would no more fear death than the sun fears the night. In the\n“Bhagavad-Gita” Krishna thus raises the mind of his young pupil Arjuna,\nwhen, seized with compunction at the sight of the arrayed hosts (somewhat\nas Xerxes was), he loses heart and desires to give up the battle in order\nto avert the death of so many thousands. Krishna leads him to this point\nof view, and the death of those thousands can no longer restrain him; he\ngives the sign for battle. This point of view is also expressed by\nGoethe’s Prometheus, especially when he says—\n\n    “Here sit I, form mankind\n    In my own image,\n    A race like to myself,\n    To suffer and to weep,\n    Rejoice, enjoy,\n    And heed thee not,\n    As I.”\n\nThe philosophy of Bruno and that of Spinoza might also lead any one to\nthis point of view whose conviction was not shaken and weakened by their\nerrors and imperfections. That of Bruno has properly no ethical theory at\nall, and the theory contained in the philosophy of Spinoza does not really\nproceed from the inner nature of his doctrine, but is merely tacked on to\nit by means of weak and palpable sophisms, though in itself it is\npraiseworthy and beautiful. Finally, there are many men who would occupy\nthis point of view if their knowledge kept pace with their will, _i.e._,\nif, free from all illusion, they were in a position to become clearly and\ndistinctly themselves. For this is, for knowledge, the point of view of\nthe complete _assertion of the will to live_.\n\nThat the will asserts itself means, that while in its objectivity, _i.e._,\nin the world and life, its own nature is completely and distinctly given\nit as idea, this knowledge does not by any means check its volition; but\nthis very life, so known, is willed as such by the will with knowledge,\nconsciously and deliberately, just as up to this point it willed it as\nblind effort without knowledge. The opposite of this, the _denial of the\nwill to live_, shows itself if, when that knowledge is attained, volition\nends, because the particular known phenomena no longer act as _motives_\nfor willing, but the whole knowledge of the nature of the world, the\nmirror of the will, which has grown up through the comprehension of the\n_Ideas_, becomes a _quieter_ of the will; and thus free, the will\nsuppresses itself. These quite unfamiliar conceptions are difficult to\nunderstand when expressed in this general way, but it is hoped they will\nbecome clear through the exposition we shall give presently, with special\nreference to action, of the phenomena in which, on the one hand, the\nassertion in its different grades, and, on the other hand, the denial,\nexpresses itself. For both proceed from knowledge, yet not from abstract\nknowledge, which is expressed in words, but from living knowledge, which\nis expressed in action and behaviour alone, and is independent of the\ndogmas which at the same time occupy the reason as abstract knowledge. To\nexhibit them both, and bring them to distinct knowledge of the reason, can\nalone be my aim, and not to prescribe or recommend the one or the other,\nwhich would be as foolish as it would be useless; for the will in itself\nis absolutely free and entirely self-determining, and for it there is no\nlaw. But before we go on to the exposition referred to, we must first\nexplain and more exactly define this _freedom_ and its relation to\nnecessity. And also, with regard to the life, the assertion and denial of\nwhich is our problem, we must insert a few general remarks connected with\nthe will and its objects. Through all this we shall facilitate the\napprehension of the inmost nature of the knowledge we are aiming at, of\nthe ethical significance of methods of action.\n\nSince, as has been said, this whole work is only the unfolding of a single\nthought, it follows that all its parts have the most intimate connection\nwith each other. Not merely that each part stands in a necessary relation\nto what immediately precedes it, and only presupposes a recollection of\nthat by the reader, as is the case with all philosophies which consist\nmerely of a series of inferences, but that every part of the whole work is\nrelated to every other part and presupposes it. It is, therefore,\nnecessary that the reader should remember not only what has just been\nsaid, but all the earlier parts of the work, so that he may be able to\nconnect them with what he is reading, however much may have intervened.\nPlato also makes this demand upon his readers through the intricate\ndigressions of his dialogues, in which he only returns to the leading\nthought after long episodes, which illustrate and explain it. In our case\nthis demand is necessary; for the breaking up of our one single thought\ninto its many aspects is indeed the only means of imparting it, though not\nessential to the thought itself, but merely an artificial form. The\ndivision of four principal points of view into four books, and the most\ncareful bringing together of all that is related and homogeneous, assists\nthe exposition and its comprehension; yet the material absolutely does not\nadmit of an advance in a straight line, such as the progress of history,\nbut necessitates a more complicated exposition. This again makes a\nrepeated study of the book necessary, for thus alone does the connection\nof all the parts with each other become distinct, and only then do they\nall mutually throw light upon each other and become quite clear.(68)",

    "page_content": "according to our view, it is the thing-in-itself, the content of all\nphenomena. The phenomena, on the other hand, we recognise as absolutely\nsubordinate to the principle of sufficient reason in its four forms. And\nsince we know that necessity is throughout identical with following from\ngiven grounds, and that these are convertible conceptions, all that\nbelongs to the phenomenon, _i.e._, all that is object for the knowing\nsubject as individual, is in one aspect reason, and in another aspect\nconsequent; and in this last capacity is determined with absolute\nnecessity, and can, therefore, in no respect be other than it is. The\nwhole content of Nature, the collective sum of its phenomena, is thus\nthroughout necessary, and the necessity of every part, of every\nphenomenon, of every event, can always be proved, because it must be\npossible to find the reason from which it follows as a consequent. This\nadmits of no exception: it follows from the unrestricted validity of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. In another aspect, however, the same world\nis for us, in all its phenomena, objectivity of will. And the will, since\nit is not phenomenon, is not idea or object, but thing-in-itself, and is\nnot subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason, the form of all\nobject; thus is not determined as a consequent through any reason, knows\nno necessity, _i.e._, is _free_. The concept of freedom is thus properly a\nnegative concept, for its content is merely the denial of necessity,\n_i.e._, the relation of consequent to its reason, according to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Now here lies before us in its most\ndistinct form the solution of that great contradiction, the union of\nfreedom with necessity, which has so often been discussed in recent times,\nyet, so far as I know, never clearly and adequately. Everything is as\nphenomenon, as object, absolutely necessary: _in itself_ it is will, which\nis perfectly free to all eternity. The phenomenon, the object, is\nnecessarily and unalterably determined in that chain of causes and effects\nwhich admits of no interruption. But the existence in general of this\nobject, and its specific nature, _i.e._, the Idea which reveals itself in\nit, or, in other words, its character, is a direct manifestation of will.\nThus, in conformity with the freedom of this will, the object might not be\nat all, or it might be originally and essentially something quite\ndifferent from what it is, in which case, however, the whole chain of\nwhich it is a link, and which is itself a manifestation of the same will,\nwould be quite different also. But once there and existing, it has entered\nthe chain of causes and effects, is always necessarily determined in it,\nand can, therefore, neither become something else, _i.e._, change itself,\nnor yet escape from the chain, _i.e._, vanish. Man, like every other part\nof Nature, is objectivity of the will; therefore all that has been said\nholds good of him. As everything in Nature has its forces and qualities,\nwhich react in a definite way when definitely affected, and constitute its\ncharacter, man also has his _character_, from which the motives call forth\nhis actions with necessity. In this manner of conduct his empirical\ncharacter reveals itself, but in this again his intelligible character,\nthe will in itself, whose determined phenomenon he is. But man is the most\ncomplete phenomenon of will, and, as we explained in the Second Book, he\nhad to be enlightened with so high a degree of knowledge in order to\nmaintain himself in existence, that in it a perfectly adequate copy or\nrepetition of the nature of the world under the form of the idea became\npossible: this is the comprehension of the Ideas, the pure mirror of the\nworld, as we learnt in the Third Book. Thus in man the will can attain to\nfull self-consciousness, to distinct and exhaustive knowledge of its own\nnature, as it mirrors itself in the whole world. We saw in the preceding\nbook that art springs from the actual presence of this degree of\nknowledge; and at the end of our whole work it will further appear that,\nthrough the same knowledge, in that the will relates it to itself, a\nsuppression and self-denial of the will in its most perfect manifestation\nis possible. So that the freedom which otherwise, as belonging to the\nthing-in-itself, can never show itself in the phenomenon, in such a case\ndoes also appear in it, and, by abolishing the nature which lies at the\nfoundation of the phenomenon, while the latter itself still continues to\nexist in time, it brings about a contradiction of the phenomenon with\nitself, and in this way exhibits the phenomena of holiness and\nself-renunciation. But all this can only be fully understood at the end of\nthis book. What has just been said merely affords a preliminary and\ngeneral indication of how man is distinguished from all the other\nphenomena of will by the fact that freedom, _i.e._, independence of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, which only belongs to the will as\nthing-in-itself, and contradicts the phenomenon, may yet possibly, in his\ncase, appear in the phenomenon also, where, however, it necessarily\nexhibits itself as a contradiction of the phenomenon with itself. In this\nsense, not only the will in itself, but man also may certainly be called\nfree, and thus distinguished from all other beings. But how this is to be\nunderstood can only become clear through all that is to follow, and for\nthe present we must turn away from it altogether. For, in the first place,\nwe must beware of the error that the action of the individual definite man\nis subject to no necessity, _i.e._, that the power of the motive is less\ncertain than the power of the cause, or the following of the conclusion\nfrom the premises. The freedom of the will as thing-in-itself, if, as has\nbeen said, we abstract from the entirely exceptional case mentioned above,\nby no means extends directly to its phenomenon, not even in the case in\nwhich this reaches the highest made of its visibility, and thus does not\nextend to the rational animal endowed with individual character, _i.e._,\nthe person. The person is never free although he is the phenomenon of a\nfree will; for he is already the determined phenomenon of the free\nvolition of this will, and, because he enters the form of every object,\nthe principle of sufficient reason, he develops indeed the unity of that\nwill in a multiplicity of actions, but on account of the timeless unity of\nthat volition in itself, this multiplicity exhibits in itself the regular\nconformity to law of a force of Nature. Since, however, it is that free\nvolition that becomes visible in the person and the whole of his conduct,\nrelating itself to him as the concept to the definition, every individual\naction of the person is to be ascribed to the free will, and directly\nproclaims itself as such in consciousness. Therefore, as was said in the\nSecond Book, every one regards himself _a priori_ (_i.e._, here in this\noriginal feeling) as free in his individual actions, in the sense that in\nevery given case every action is possible for him, and he only recognises\n_a posteriori_ from experience and reflection upon experience that his\nactions take place with absolute necessity from the coincidence of his\ncharacter with his motives. Hence it arises that every uncultured man,\nfollowing his feeling, ardently defends complete freedom in particular\nactions, while the great thinkers of all ages, and indeed the more\nprofound systems of religion, have denied it. But whoever has come to see\nclearly that the whole nature of man is will, and he himself only a\nphenomenon of this will, and that such a phenomenon has, even from the\nsubject itself, the principle of sufficient reason as its necessary form,\nwhich here appears as the law of motivation,—such a man will regard it as\njust as absurd to doubt the inevitable nature of an action when the motive\nis presented to a given character, as to doubt that the three angles of\nany triangle are together equal to two right angles. Priestley has very\nsufficiently proved the necessity of the individual action in his\n“Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity;” but Kant, whose merit in this\nrespect is specially great, first proved the coexistence of this necessity\nwith the freedom of the will in itself, _i.e._, apart from the\nphenomenon,(69) by establishing the distinction between the intelligible\nand the empirical character. I entirely adhere to this distinction, for\nthe former is the will as thing-in-itself so far as it appears in a\ndefinite individual in a definite grade, and the latter is this phenomenon\nitself as it exhibits itself in time in the mode of action, and in space\nin the physical structure. In order to make the relation of the two\ncomprehensible, the best expression is that which I have already used in\nthe introductory essay, that the intelligible character of every man is to\nbe regarded as an act of will outside time, and therefore indivisible and\nunchangeable, and the manifestation of this act of will developed and\nbroken up in time and space and all the forms of the principle of\nsufficient reason is the empirical character as it exhibits itself for\nexperience in the whole conduct and life of this man. As the whole tree is\nonly the constantly repeated manifestation of one and the same tendency,\nwhich exhibits itself in its simplest form in the fibre, and recurs and is\neasily recognised in the construction of the leaf, shoot, branch, and\ntrunk, so all a man’s deeds are merely the constantly repeated expression,\nsomewhat varied in form, of his intelligible character, and the induction\nbased on the sum of all these expressions gives us his empirical\ncharacter. For the rest, I shall not at this point repeat in my own words\nKant’s masterly exposition, but presuppose it as known.\n\nIn the year 1840 I dealt with the important chapter on the freedom of the\nwill, thoroughly and in detail, in my crowned prize-essay upon the\nsubject, and exposed the reason of the delusion which led men to imagine\nthat they found an empirically given absolute freedom of the will, that is\nto say, a _liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ_, as a fact in\nself-consciousness; for the question propounded for the essay was with\ngreat insight directed to this point. Therefore, as I refer the reader to\nthat work, and also to the tenth paragraph of the prize-essay on the basis\nof morals, which was published along with it under the title “The Two\nFundamental Problems of Ethics,” I now omit the incomplete exposition of\nthe necessity of the act of will, which was given at this place in the\nfirst edition. Instead of it I shall explain the delusion mentioned above\nin a brief discussion which is presupposed in the nineteenth chapter of\nthe supplement to the present work, and therefore could not be given in\nthe prize-essay referred to.\n\nApart from the fact that the will as the true thing-in-itself is actually\noriginal and independent, and that the feeling of its originality and\nabsoluteness must accompany its acts in self-consciousness, though here\nthey are already determined, there arises the illusion of an empirical\nfreedom of the will (instead of the transcendental freedom which alone is\nto be attributed to it), and thus a freedom of its particular actions,\nfrom that attitude of the intellect towards the will which is explained,\nseparated, and subordinated in the nineteenth chapter of the supplement,\nespecially under No. 3. The intellect knows the conclusions of the will\nonly _a posteriori_ and empirically; therefore when a choice is presented,\nit has no data as to how the will is to decide. For the intelligible\ncharacter, by virtue of which, when motives are given, only _one_ decision\nis possible and is therefore necessary, does not come within the knowledge\nof the intellect, but merely the empirical character is known to it\nthrough the succession of its particular acts. Therefore it seems to the\nintellect that in a given case two opposite decisions are possible for the\nwill. But this is just the same thing as if we were to say of a\nperpendicular beam that has lost its balance, and is hesitating which way\nto fall, “It can fall either to the right hand or the left.” This _can_\nhas merely a subjective significance, and really means “as far as the data\nknown to us are concerned.” Objectively, the direction of the fall is\nnecessarily determined as soon as the equilibrium is lost. Accordingly,\nthe decision of one’s own will is undetermined only to the beholder, one’s\nown intellect, and thus merely relatively and subjectively for the subject\nof knowing. In itself and objectively, on the other hand, in every choice\npresented to it, its decision is at once determined and necessary. But\nthis determination only comes into consciousness through the decision that\nfollows upon it. Indeed, we receive an empirical proof of this when any\ndifficult and important choice lies before us, but only under a condition\nwhich is not yet present, but merely hoped for, so that in the meanwhile\nwe can do nothing, but must remain passive. Now we consider how we shall\ndecide when the circumstances occur that will give us a free activity and\nchoice. Generally the foresight of rational deliberation recommends one\ndecision, while direct inclination leans rather to the other. So long as\nwe are compelled to remain passive, the side of reason seems to wish to\nkeep the upper hand; but we see beforehand how strongly the other side\nwill influence us when the opportunity for action arises. Till then we are\neagerly concerned to place the motives on both sides in the clearest\nlight, by calm meditation on the _pro et contra_, so that every motive may\nexert its full influence upon the will when the time arrives, and it may\nnot be misled by a mistake on the part of the intellect to decide\notherwise than it would have done if all the motives had their due\ninfluence upon it. But this distinct unfolding of the motives on both\nsides is all that the intellect can do to assist the choice. It awaits the\nreal decision just as passively and with the same intense curiosity as if\nit were that of a foreign will. Therefore from its point of view both\ndecisions must seem to it equally possible; and this is just the illusion\nof the empirical freedom of the will. Certainly the decision enters the\nsphere of the intellect altogether empirically, as the final conclusion of\nthe matter; but yet it proceeded from the inner nature, the intelligible\ncharacter, of the individual will in its conflict with given motives, and\ntherefore with complete necessity. The intellect can do nothing more than\nbring out clearly and fully the nature of the motives; it cannot determine\nthe will itself; for the will is quite inaccessible to it, and, as we have\nseen, cannot be investigated.\n\nIf, under the same circumstances, a man could act now one way and now\nanother, it would be necessary that his will itself should have changed in\nthe meantime, and thus that it should lie in time, for change is only\npossible in time; but then either the will would be a mere phenomenon, or\ntime would be a condition of the thing-in-itself. Accordingly the dispute\nas to the freedom of the particular action, the _liberum arbitrium\nindifferentiæ_, really turns on the question whether the will lies in time\nor not. If, as both Kant’s doctrine and the whole of my system\nnecessitates, the will is the thing-in-itself outside time and outside\nevery form of the principle of sufficient reason, not only must the\nindividual act in the same way in the same circumstances, and not only\nmust every bad action be the sure warrant of innumerable others, which the\nindividual _must_ perform and _cannot_ leave, but, as Kant said, if only\nthe empirical character and the motives were completely given, it would be\npossible to calculate the future conduct of a man just as we can calculate\nan eclipse of the sun or moon. As Nature is consistent, so is the\ncharacter; every action must take place in accordance with it, just as\nevery phenomenon takes place according to a law of Nature: the causes in\nthe latter case and the motives in the former are merely the occasional\ncauses, as was shown in the Second Book. The will, whose phenomenon is the\nwhole being and life of man, cannot deny itself in the particular case,\nand what the man wills on the whole, that will he also will in the\nparticular case.\n\nThe assertion of an empirical freedom of the will, a _liberum arbitrium\nindifferentiæ_, agrees precisely with the doctrine that places the inner\nnature of man in a _soul_, which is originally a _knowing_, and indeed\nreally an abstract _thinking_ nature, and only in consequence of this a\n_willing_ nature—a doctrine which thus regards the will as of a secondary\nor derivative nature, instead of knowledge which is really so. The will\nindeed came to be regarded as an act of thought, and to be identified with\nthe judgment, especially by Descartes and Spinoza. According to this\ndoctrine every man must become what he is only through his knowledge; he\nmust enter the world as a moral cipher come to know the things in it, and\nthereupon determine to be this or that, to act thus or thus, and may also\nthrough new knowledge achieve a new course of action, that is to say,\nbecome another person. Further, he must first know a thing to be _good_,\nand in consequence of this will it, instead of first _willing_ it, and in\nconsequence of this calling it _good_. According to my fundamental point\nof view, all this is a reversal of the true relation. Will is first and\noriginal; knowledge is merely added to it as an instrument belonging to\nthe phenomenon of will. Therefore every man is what he is through his\nwill, and his character is original, for willing is the basis of his\nnature. Through the knowledge which is added to it he comes to know in the\ncourse of experience _what he is_, _i.e._, he learns his character. Thus\nhe _knows_ himself in consequence of and in accordance with the nature of\nhis will, instead of _willing_ in consequence of and in accordance with\nhis knowing. According to the latter view, he would only require to\nconsider how he would like best to be, and he would be it; that is its\ndoctrine of the freedom of the will. Thus it consists really in this, that\na man is his own work guided by the light of knowledge. I, on the\ncontrary, say that he is his own work before all knowledge, and knowledge\nis merely added to it to enlighten it. Therefore he cannot resolve to be\nthis or that, nor can he become other than he is; but he _is_ once for\nall, and he knows in the course of experience _what_ he is. According to\none doctrine he _wills_ what he knows, and according to the other he\n_knows_ what he wills.\n\nThe Greeks called the character ηθος, and its expression, _i.e._, morals,\nηθη. But this word comes from εθος, custom; they chose it in order to\nexpress metaphorically the constancy of character through the constancy of\ncustom. Το γαρ ηθος απο του εθους εχει την επωνυμιαν. ηθικε γαρ καλειται\nδια το εθιζεσθαι (_a voce_ ηθος, _i.e._, _consuetudo_ ηθος _est\nappellatum: ethica ergo dicta est_ απο του εθιζεσθαι, _sivi ab\nassuescendo_) says Aristotle (Eth. Magna, i. 6, p. 1186, and Eth. Eud., p.\n1220, and Eth. Nic., p. 1103, ed. Ber.) Stobæus quotes: οἱ δε κατα Ζηνωνα\nτροπικως; ηθος εστι πηγη βιου αφ᾽ ἡς αἱ κατα μερος πραξεις ρεουσι (_Stoici\nautem, Zenonis castra sequentes, metaphorice ethos definiunt vitæ fontem,\ne quo singulæ manant actiones_), ii. ch. 7. In Christian theology we find\nthe dogma of predestination in consequence of election and non-election\n(Rom. ix. 11-24), clearly originating from the knowledge that man does not\nchange himself, but his life and conduct, _i.e._, his empirical character,\nis only the unfolding of his intelligible character, the development of\ndecided and unchangeable natural dispositions recognisable even in the\nchild; therefore, as it were, even at his birth his conduct is firmly\ndetermined, and remains essentially the same to the end. This we entirely\nagree with; but certainly the consequences which followed from the union\nof this perfectly correct insight with the dogmas that already existed in\nJewish theology, and which now gave rise to the great difficulty, the\nGordian knot upon which most of the controversies of the Church turned, I\ndo not undertake to defend, for even the Apostle Paul scarcely succeeded\nin doing so by means of his simile of the potter’s vessels which he\ninvented for the purpose, for the result he finally arrived at was nothing\nelse than this:—\n\n    “Let mankind\n    Fear the gods!\n    They hold the power\n    In everlasting hands:\n    And they can use it\n    As seems good to them.”\n\nSuch considerations, however, are really foreign to our subject. Some\nexplanation as to the relation between the character and the knowledge in\nwhich all its motives lie, will now be more to the point.\n\nThe motives which determine the manifestation of the character or conduct\ninfluence it through the medium of knowledge. But knowledge is changeable,\nand often vacillates between truth and error, yet, as a rule, is rectified\nmore and more in the course of life, though certainly in very different\ndegrees. Therefore the conduct of a man may be observably altered without\njustifying us in concluding that his character has been changed. What the\nman really and in general wills, the striving of his inmost nature, and\nthe end he pursues in accordance with it, this we can never change by\ninfluence upon him from without by instruction, otherwise we could\ntransform him. Seneca says admirably, _velle non discitur_; whereby he\npreferred truth to his Stoic philosophers, who taught διδακτην ειναι την\nαρετην (_doceri posse virtutem_). From without the will can only be\naffected by motives. But these can never change the will itself; for they\nhave power over it only under the presupposition that it is precisely such\nas it is. All that they can do is thus to alter the direction of its\neffort, _i.e._, bring it about that it shall seek in another way than it\nhas hitherto done that which it invariably seeks. Therefore instruction,\nimproved knowledge, in other words, influence from without, may indeed\nteach the will that it erred in the means it employed, and can therefore\nbring it about that the end after which it strives once for all according\nto its inner nature shall be pursued on an entirely different path and in\nan entirely different object from what has hitherto been the case. But it\ncan never bring about that the will shall will something actually\ndifferent from what it has hitherto willed; this remains unchangeable, for\nthe will is simply this willing itself, which would have to be abolished.\nThe former, however, the possible modification of knowledge, and through\nknowledge of conduct, extends so far that the will seeks to attain its\nunalterable end, for example, Mohammed’s paradise, at one time in the real\nworld, at another time in a world of imagination, adapting the means to\neach, and thus in the first case applying prudence, might, and fraud, and\nin the second case, abstinence, justice, alms, and pilgrimages to Mecca.\nBut its effort itself has not therefore changed, still less the will\nitself. Thus, although its action certainly shows itself very different at\ndifferent times, its willing has yet remained precisely the same. _Velle\nnon discitur._\n\nFor motives to act, it is necessary not only that they should be present,\nbut that they should be known; for, according to a very good expression of\nthe schoolmen, which we referred to once before, _causa finalis movet non\nsecundum suum esse reale; sed secundum esse cognitum_. For example, in\norder that the relation may appear that exists in a given man between\negoism and sympathy, it is not sufficient that he should possess wealth\nand see others in want, but he must also know what he can do with his\nwealth, both for himself and for others: not only must the suffering of\nothers be presented to him, but he must know both what suffering and also\nwhat pleasure is. Perhaps, on a first occasion, he did not know all this\nso well as on a second; and if, on a similar occasion, he acts\ndifferently, this arises simply from the fact that the circumstances were\nreally different, as regards the part of them that depends on his knowing\nthem, although they seem to be the same. As ignorance of actually existing\ncircumstances robs them of their influence, so, on the other hand,\nentirely imaginary circumstances may act as if they were real, not only in\nthe case of a particular deception, but also in general and continuously.\nFor example, if a man is firmly persuaded that every good action will be\nrepaid him a hundredfold in a future life, such a conviction affects him\nin precisely the same way as a good bill of exchange at a very long date,\nand he can give from mere egoism, as from another point of view he would\ntake from egoism. He has not changed himself: _velle non discitur._ It is\non account of this great influence of knowledge upon action, while the\nwill remains unchangeable, that the character develops and its different\nfeatures appear only little by little. Therefore it shows itself different\nat every period of life, and an impetuous, wild youth may be succeeded by\na staid, sober, manly age. Especially what is bad in the character will\nalways come out more strongly with time, yet sometimes it occurs that\npassions which a man gave way to in his youth are afterwards voluntarily\nrestrained, simply because the motives opposed to them have only then come\ninto knowledge. Hence, also, we are all innocent to begin with, and this\nmerely means that neither we nor others know the evil of our own nature;\nit only appears with the motives, and only in time do the motives appear\nin knowledge. Finally we come to know ourselves as quite different from\nwhat _a priori_ we supposed ourselves to be, and then we are often\nterrified at ourselves.\n\nRepentance never proceeds from a change of the will (which is impossible),\nbut from a change of knowledge. The essential and peculiar in what I have\nalways willed I must still continue to will; for I myself am this will\nwhich lies outside time and change. I can therefore never repent of what I\nhave willed, though I can repent of what I have done; because, led by\nfalse conceptions, I did something that was not in conformity with my\nwill. The discovery of this through fuller knowledge is _repentance_. This\nextends not merely to worldly wisdom, to the choice of the means, and the\njudgment of the appropriateness of the end to my own will, but also to\nwhat is properly ethical. For example, I may have acted more egotistically\nthan is in accordance with my character, led astray by exaggerated ideas\nof the need in which I myself stood, or of the craft, falseness, and\nwickedness of others, or because I hurried too much, _i.e._, acted without\ndeliberation, determined not by motives distinctly known _in abstracto_,\nbut by merely perceived motives, by the present and the emotion which it\nexcited, and which was so strong that I had not properly the use of my\nreason; but the return of reflection is thus here also merely corrected\nknowledge, and from this repentance may proceed, which always proclaims\nitself by making amends for the past, as far as is possible. Yet it must\nbe observed that, in order to deceive themselves, men prearrange what seem\nto be hasty errors, but are really secretly considered actions. For we\ndeceive and flatter no one through such fine devices as ourselves. The\nconverse of the case we have given may also occur. I may be misled by too\ngood an opinion of others, or want of knowledge of the relative value of\nthe good things of life, or some abstract dogma in which I have since lost\nfaith, and thus I may act less egotistically than is in keeping with my\ncharacter, and lay up for myself repentance of another kind. Thus\nrepentance is always corrected knowledge of the relation of an act to its\nspecial intention. When the will reveals its Ideas in space alone, _i.e._,\nthrough mere form, the matter in which other Ideas—in this case natural\nforces—already reign, resists the will, and seldom allows the form that is\nstriving after visibility to appear in perfect purity and distinctness,\n_i.e._, in perfect beauty. And there is an analogous hindrance to the will\nas it reveals itself in time alone, _i.e._, through actions, in the\nknowledge which seldom gives it the data quite correctly, so that the\naction which takes place does not accurately correspond to the will, and\nleads to repentance. Repentance thus always proceeds from corrected\nknowledge, not from the change of the will, which is impossible. Anguish\nof conscience for past deeds is anything but repentance. It is pain at the\nknowledge of oneself in one’s inmost nature, _i.e._, as will. It rests\nprecisely on the certainty that we have still the same will. If the will\nwere changed, and therefore the anguish of conscience mere repentance, it\nwould cease to exist. The past could then no longer give us pain, for it\nexhibited the expressions of a will which is no longer that of him who has\nrepented. We shall explain the significance of anguish of conscience in\ndetail farther on.\n\nThe influence which knowledge, as the medium of motives, exerts, not\nindeed upon the will itself, but upon its appearance in actions, is also\nthe source of the principal distinction between the action of men and that\nof brutes, for their methods of knowledge are different. The brute has\nonly knowledge of perception, the man, through reason, has also abstract\nideas, conceptions. Now, although man and brute are with equal necessity\ndetermined by their motives, yet man, as distinguished from the brute, has\na complete _choice_, which has often been regarded as a freedom of the\nwill in particular actions, although it is nothing but the possibility of\na thoroughly-fought-out battle between several motives, the strongest of\nwhich then determines it with necessity. For this the motives must have\nassumed the form of abstract thoughts, because it is really only by means\nof these that deliberation, _i.e._, a weighing of opposite reasons for\naction, is possible. In the case of the brute there can only be a choice\nbetween perceptible motives presented to it, so that the choice is limited\nto the narrow sphere of its present sensuous perception. Therefore the\nnecessity of the determination of the will by the motive, which is like\nthat of the effect by the cause, can be exhibited perceptibly and directly\nonly in the case of the brutes, because here the spectator has the motives\njust as directly before his eyes as their effect; while in the case of man\nthe motives are almost always abstract ideas, which are not communicated\nto the spectator, and even for the actor himself the necessity of their\neffect is hidden behind their conflict. For only _in abstracto_ can\nseveral ideas, as judgments and chains of conclusions, lie beside each\nother in consciousness, and then, free from all determination of time,\nwork against each other till the stronger overcomes the rest and\ndetermines the will. This is the complete _choice_ or power of\ndeliberation which man has as distinguished from the brutes, and on\naccount of which freedom of the will has been attributed to him, in the\nbelief that his willing is a mere result of the operations of his\nintellect, without a definite tendency which serves as its basis; while,\nin truth, the motives only work on the foundation and under the\npresupposition of his definite tendency, which in his case is individual,\n_i.e._, a character. A fuller exposition of this power of deliberation,\nand the difference between human and brute choice which is introduced by\nit, will be found in the “Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics” (1st\nedition, p. 35, _et seq._; 2d edition, p. 34, _et seq._), to which I\ntherefore refer. For the rest, this power of deliberation which man\npossesses is one of those things that makes his existence so much more\nmiserable than that of the brute. For in general our greatest sufferings\ndo not lie in the present as ideas of perception or as immediate feelings;\nbut in the reason, as abstract conceptions, painful thoughts, from which\nthe brute, which lives only in the present, and therefore in enviable\ncarelessness, is entirely free.\n\nIt seems to have been the dependence, which we have shown, of the human\npower of deliberation upon the faculty of abstract thinking, and thus also\nof judging and drawing conclusions also, that led both Descartes and\nSpinoza to identify the decisions of the will with the faculty of\nasserting and denying (the faculty of judgment). From this Descartes\ndeduced the doctrine that the will, which, according to him, is\nindifferently free, is the source of sin, and also of all theoretical\nerror. And Spinoza, on the other hand, concluded that the will is\nnecessarily determined by the motives, as the judgment is by the\nreasons.(70) The latter doctrine is in a sense true, but it appears as a\ntrue conclusion from false premises.\n\nThe distinction we have established between the ways in which the brutes\nand man are respectively moved by motives exerts a very wide influence\nupon the nature of both, and has most to do with the complete and obvious\ndifferences of their existence. While an idea of perception is in every\ncase the motive which determines the brute, the man strives to exclude\nthis kind of motivation altogether, and to determine himself entirely by\nabstract ideas. Thus he uses his prerogative of reason to the greatest\npossible advantage. Independent of the present, he neither chooses nor\navoids the passing pleasure or pain, but reflects on the consequences of\nboth. In most cases, setting aside quite insignificant actions, we are\ndetermined by abstract, thought motives, not present impressions.\nTherefore all particular privation for the moment is for us comparatively\nlight, but all renunciation is terribly hard; for the former only concerns\nthe fleeting present, but the latter concerns the future, and includes in\nitself innumerable privations, of which it is the equivalent. The causes\nof our pain, as of our pleasure, lie for the most part, not in the real\npresent, but merely in abstract thoughts. It is these which are often\nunbearable to us—inflict torments in comparison with which all the\nsufferings of the animal world are very small; for even our own physical\npain is not felt at all when they are present. Indeed, in the case of keen\nmental suffering, we even inflict physical suffering on ourselves merely\nto distract our attention from the former to the latter. This is why, in\ngreat mental anguish, men tear their hair, beat their breasts, lacerate\ntheir faces, or roll on the floor, for all these are in reality only\nviolent means of diverting the mind from an unbearable thought. Just\nbecause mental pain, being much greater, makes us insensible to physical\npain, suicide is very easy to the person who is in despair, or who is\nconsumed by morbid depression, even though formerly, in comfortable\ncircumstances, he recoiled at the thought of it. In the same way care and\npassion (thus the play of thought) wear out the body oftener and more than\nphysical hardships. And in accordance with this Epictetus rightly says:\nΤαρασσει τους ανθρωπους ου τα πραγματα, αλλα τα περι των πραγματων δογματα\n(_Perturbant homines non res ipsæ, sed de rebus decreta_) (V.); and\nSeneca: _Plura sunt quæ nos terrent, quam quæ premunt, et sæpius opinione\nquam re laboramus_ (Ep. 5). Eulenspiegel also admirably bantered human\nnature, for going uphill he laughed, and going downhill he wept. Indeed,\nchildren who have hurt themselves often cry, not at the pain, but at the\nthought of the pain which is awakened when some one condoles with them.\nSuch great differences in conduct and in life arise from the diversity\nbetween the methods of knowledge of the brutes and man. Further, the\nappearance of the distinct and decided individual character, the principal\ndistinction between man and the brute, which has scarcely more than the\ncharacter of the species, is conditioned by the choice between several\nmotives, which is only possible through abstract conceptions. For only\nafter a choice has been made are the resolutions, which vary in different\nindividuals, an indication of the individual character which is different\nin each; while the action of the brute depends only upon the presence or\nabsence of the impression, supposing this impression to be in general a\nmotive for its species. And, finally, in the case of man, only the\nresolve, and not the mere wish, is a valid indication of his character\nboth for himself and for others; but the resolve becomes for himself, as\nfor others, a certain fact only through the deed. The wish is merely the\nnecessary consequence of the present impression, whether of the outward\nstimulus, or the inward passing mood; and is therefore as immediately\nnecessary and devoid of consideration as the action of the brutes.\nTherefore, like the action of the brutes, it merely expresses the\ncharacter of the species, not that of the individual, _i.e._, it indicates\nmerely what _man in general_, not what the individual who experiences the\nwish, is capable of doing. The deed alone,—because as human action it\nalways requires a certain deliberation, and because as a rule a man has\ncommand of his reason, is considerate, _i.e._, decides in accordance with\nconsidered and abstract motives,—is the expression of the intelligible\nmaxims of his conduct, the result of his inmost willing, and is related as\na letter to the word that stands for his empirical character, itself\nmerely the temporal expression of his intelligible character. In a healthy\nmind, therefore, only deeds oppress the conscience, not wishes and\nthoughts; for it is only our deeds that hold up to us the mirror of our\nwill. The deed referred to above, that is entirely unconsidered and is\nreally committed in blind passion, is to a certain extent an intermediate\nthing between the mere wish and the resolve.\n\nTherefore, by true repentance, which, however, shows itself as action\nalso, it can be obliterated, as a falsely drawn line, from that picture of\nour will which our course of life is. I may insert the remark here, as a\nvery good comparison, that the relation between wish and deed has a purely\naccidental but accurate analogy with that between the accumulation and\ndischarge of electricity.\n\nAs the result of the whole of this discussion of the freedom of the will\nand what relates to it, we find that although the will may, in itself and\napart from the phenomenon, be called free and even omnipotent, yet in its\nparticular phenomena enlightened by knowledge, as in men and brutes, it is\ndetermined by motives to which the special character regularly and\nnecessarily responds, and always in the same way. We see that because of\nthe possession on his part of abstract or rational knowledge, man, as\ndistinguished from the brutes, has a _choice_, which only makes him the\nscene of the conflict of his motives, without withdrawing him from their\ncontrol. This choice is therefore certainly the condition of the\npossibility of the complete expression of the individual character, but is\nby no means to be regarded as freedom of the particular volition, _i.e._,\nindependence of the law of causality, the necessity of which extends to\nman as to every other phenomenon. Thus the difference between human\nvolition and that of the brutes, which is introduced by reason or\nknowledge through concepts, extends to the point we have indicated, and no\nfarther. But, what is quite a different thing, there may arise a\nphenomenon of the human will which is quite impossible in the brute\ncreation, if man altogether lays aside the knowledge of particular things\nas such which is subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason, and by\nmeans of his knowledge of the Ideas sees through the _principium\nindividuationis_. Then an actual appearance of the real freedom of the\nwill as a thing-in-itself is possible, by which the phenomenon comes into\na sort of contradiction with itself, as is indicated by the word\nself-renunciation; and, finally, the “in-itself” of its nature suppresses\nitself. But this, the one, real, and direct expression of the freedom of\nthe will in itself in the phenomenon, cannot be distinctly explained here,\nbut will form the subject of the concluding part of our work.\n\nNow that we have shown clearly in these pages the unalterable nature of\nthe empirical character, which is just the unfolding of the intelligible\ncharacter that lies outside time, together with the necessity with which\nactions follow upon its contact with motives, we hasten to anticipate an\nargument which may very easily be drawn from this in the interest of bad\ndispositions. Our character is to be regarded as the temporal unfolding of\nan extra-temporal, and therefore indivisible and unalterable, act of will,\nor an intelligible character. This necessarily determines all that is\nessential in our conduct in life, _i.e._, its ethical content, which must\nexpress itself in accordance with it in its phenomenal appearance, the\nempirical character; while only what is unessential in this, the outward\nform of our course of life, depends upon the forms in which the motives\npresent themselves. It might, therefore, be inferred that it is a waste of\ntrouble to endeavour to improve one’s character, and that it is wiser to\nsubmit to the inevitable, and gratify every inclination at once, even if\nit is bad. But this is precisely the same thing as the theory of an\ninevitable fate which is called αργος λογος, and in more recent times\nTurkish faith. Its true refutation, as it is supposed to have been given\nby Chrysippus, is explained by Cicero in his book _De Fato_, ch. 12, 13.\n\nThough everything may be regarded as irrevocably predetermined by fate,\nyet it is so only through the medium of the chain of causes; therefore in\nno case can it be determined that an effect shall appear without its\ncause. Thus it is not simply the event that is predetermined, but the\nevent as the consequence of preceding causes; so that fate does not decide\nthe consequence alone, but also the means as the consequence of which it\nis destined to appear. Accordingly, if some means is not present, it is\ncertain that the consequence also will not be present: each is always\npresent in accordance with the determination of fate, but this is never\nknown to us till afterwards.\n\nAs events always take place according to fate, _i.e._, according to the\ninfinite concatenation of causes, so our actions always take place\naccording to our intelligible character. But just as we do not know the\nformer beforehand, so no _a priori_ insight is given us into the latter,\nbut we only come to know ourselves as we come to know other persons _a\nposteriori_ through experience. If the intelligible character involved\nthat we could only form a good resolution after a long conflict with a bad\ndisposition, this conflict would have to come first and be waited for.\nReflection on the unalterable nature of the character, on the unity of the\nsource from which all our actions flow, must not mislead us into claiming\nthe decision of the character in favour of one side or the other; it is in\nthe resolve that follows that we shall see what manner of men we are, and\nmirror ourselves in our actions. This is the explanation of the\nsatisfaction or the anguish of soul with which we look back on the course\nof our past life. Both are experienced, not because these past deeds have\nstill an existence; they are past, they have been, and now are no more;\nbut their great importance for us lies in their significance, lies in the\nfact that these deeds are the expression of the character, the mirror of\nthe will, in which we look and recognise our inmost self, the kernel of\nour will. Because we experience this not before, but only after, it\nbehoves us to strive and fight in time, in order that the picture we\nproduce by our deeds may be such that the contemplation of it may calm us\nas much as possible, instead of harassing us. The significance of this\nconsolation or anguish of soul will, as we have said, be inquired into\nfarther on; but to this place there belongs the inquiry which follows, and\nwhich stands by itself.\n\nBesides the intelligible and the empirical character, we must mention a\nthird which is different from them both, the _acquired character_, which\none only receives in life through contact with the world, and which is\nreferred to when one is praised as a man of character or censured as being\nwithout character. Certainly one might suppose that, since the empirical\ncharacter, as the phenomenon of the intelligible, is unalterable, and,\nlike every natural phenomenon, is consistent with itself, man would always\nhave to appear like himself and consistent, and would therefore have no\nneed to acquire a character artificially by experience and reflection. But\nthe case is otherwise, and although a man is always the same, yet he does\nnot always understand himself, but often mistakes himself, till he has in\nsome degree acquired real self-knowledge. The empirical character, as a\nmere natural tendency, is in itself irrational; nay, more, its expressions\nare disturbed by reason, all the more so the more intellect and power of\nthought the man has; for these always keep before him what becomes _man in\ngeneral_ as the character of the species, and what is possible for him\nboth in will and in deed. This makes it the more difficult for him to see\nhow much his individuality enables him to will and to accomplish. He finds\nin himself the germs of all the various human pursuits and powers, but the\ndifference of degree in which they exist in his individuality is not clear\nto him in the absence of experience; and if he now applies himself to the\npursuits which alone correspond to his character, he yet feels, especially\nat particular moments and in particular moods, the inclination to directly\nopposite pursuits which cannot be combined with them, but must be entirely\nsuppressed if he desires to follow the former undisturbed. For as our\nphysical path upon earth is always merely a line, not an extended surface,\nso in life, if we desire to grasp and possess one thing, we must renounce\nand leave innumerable others on the right hand and on the left. If we\ncannot make up our minds to this, but, like children at the fair, snatch\nat everything that attracts us in passing, we are making the perverse\nendeavour to change the line of our path into an extended surface; we run\nin a zigzag, skip about like a will o’ the wisp, and attain to nothing.\nOr, to use another comparison, as, according to Hobbes’ philosophy of law,\nevery one has an original right to everything but an exclusive right to\nnothing, yet can obtain an exclusive right to particular things by\nrenouncing his right to all the rest, while others, on their part, do\nlikewise with regard to what he has chosen; so is it in life, in which\nsome definite pursuit, whether it be pleasure, honour, wealth, science,\nart, or virtue, can only be followed with seriousness and success when all\nclaims that are foreign to it are given up, when everything else is\nrenounced. Accordingly, the mere will and the mere ability are not\nsufficient, but a man must also _know_ what he wills, and _know_ what he\ncan do; only then will he show character, and only then can he accomplish\nsomething right. Until he attains to that, notwithstanding the natural\nconsistency of the empirical character, he is without character. And\nalthough, on the whole, he must remain true to himself, and fulfil his\ncourse, led by his dæmon, yet his path will not be a straight line, but\nwavering and uneven. He will hesitate, deviate, turn back, lay up for\nhimself repentance and pain. And all this is because, in great and small,\nhe sees before him all that is possible and attainable for man in general,\nbut does not know what part of all this is alone suitable for him, can be\naccomplished by him, and is alone enjoyable by him. He will, therefore,\nenvy many men on account of a position and circumstances which are yet\nonly suitable to their characters and not to his, and in which he would\nfeel unhappy, if indeed he found them endurable at all. For as a fish is\nonly at home in water, a bird in the air, a mole in the earth, so every\nman is only at home in the atmosphere suitable to him. For example, not\nall men can breathe the air of court life. From deficiency of proper\ninsight into all this, many a man will make all kinds of abortive\nattempts, will do violence to his character in particulars, and yet, on\nthe whole, will have to yield to it again; and what he thus painfully\nattains will give him no pleasure; what he thus learns will remain dead;\neven in an ethical regard, a deed that is too noble for his character,\nthat has not sprung from pure, direct impulse, but from a concept, a\ndogma, will lose all merit, even in his own eyes, through subsequent\negoistical repentance. _Velle non discitur._ We only become conscious of\nthe inflexibility of another person’s character through experience, and\ntill then we childishly believe that it is possible, by means of rational\nideas, by prayers and entreaties, by example and noble-mindedness, ever to\npersuade any one to leave his own way, to change his course of conduct, to\ndepart from his mode of thinking, or even to extend his capacities: so is\nit also with ourselves. We must first learn from experience what we desire\nand what we can do. Till then we know it not, we are without character,\nand must often be driven back to our own way by hard blows from without.\nBut if we have finally learnt it, then we have attained to what in the\nworld is called character, the _acquired character_. This is accordingly\nnothing but the most perfect knowledge possible of our own individuality.\nIt is the abstract, and consequently distinct, knowledge of the\nunalterable qualities of our own empirical character, and of the measure\nand direction of our mental and physical powers, and thus of the whole\nstrength and weakness of our own individuality. This places us in a\nposition to carry out deliberately and methodically the rôle which belongs\nto our own person, and to fill up the gaps which caprices or weaknesses\nproduce in it, under the guidance of fixed conceptions. This rôle is in\nitself unchangeably determined once for all, but hitherto we have allowed\nit to follow its natural course without any rule. We have now brought to\ndistinct conscious maxims which are always present to us the form of\nconduct which is necessarily determined by our own individual nature, and\nnow we conduct it in accordance with them as deliberately as if we had\nlearned it; without ever falling into error through the passing influence\nof the mood or the impression of the present, without being checked by the\nbitterness or sweetness of some particular thing we meet with on our path,\nwithout delay, without hesitation, without inconsistency. We shall now no\nlonger, as novices, wait, attempt, and grope about in order to see what we\nreally desire and are able to do, but we know this once for all, and in\nevery choice we have only to apply general principles to particular cases,\nand arrive at once at a decision. We know our will in general, and do not\nallow ourselves to be led by the passing mood or by solicitations from\nwithout to resolve in particular cases what is contrary to it as a whole.\nWe know in the same way the nature and the measure of our strength and our\nweakness, and thereby are spared much suffering. For we experience no real\npleasure except in the use and feeling of our own powers, and the greatest\npain is the conscious deficiency of our powers where we need them. If,\nnow, we have discovered where our strength and our weakness lie, we will\nendeavour to cultivate, employ, and in every way make use of those talents\nwhich are naturally prominent in us. We will always turn to those\noccupations in which they are valuable and to the purpose, and entirely\navoid, even with self-renunciation, those pursuits for which we have\nnaturally little aptitude; we will beware of attempting that in which we\nhave no chance of succeeding. Only he who has attained to this will\nconstantly and with full consciousness be completely himself, and will\nnever fail himself at the critical moment, because he will always have\nknown what he could expect from himself. He will often enjoy the\nsatisfaction of feeling his strength, and seldom experience the pain of\nbeing reminded of his weakness. The latter is mortification, which causes\nperhaps the greatest of mental sufferings; therefore it is far more\nendurable to have our misfortune brought clearly before us than our\nincapacity. And, further, if we are thus fully acquainted with our\nstrength and our weakness, we will not attempt to make a show of powers\nwhich we do not possess; we will not play with base coin, for all such\ndissimulation misses the mark in the end. For since the whole man is only\nthe phenomenon of his will, nothing can be more perverse than to try, by\nmeans of reflection, to become something else than one is, for this is a\ndirect contradiction of the will with itself. The imitation of the\nqualities and idiosyncrasies of others is much more shameful than to dress\nin other people’s clothes; for it is the judgment of our own worthlessness\npronounced by ourselves. Knowledge of our own mind and its capacities of\nevery kind, and their unalterable limits, is in this respect the surest\nway to the attainment of the greatest possible contentment with ourselves.\nFor it holds good of inward as of outward circumstances that there is for\nus no consolation so effective as the complete certainty of unalterable\nnecessity. No evil that befalls us pains us so much as the thought of the\ncircumstances by which it might have been warded off. Therefore nothing\ncomforts us so effectually as the consideration of what has happened from\nthe standpoint of necessity, from which all accidents appear as tools in\nthe hand of an overruling fate, and we therefore recognise the evil that\nhas come to us as inevitably produced by the conflict of inner and outer\ncircumstances; in other words, fatalism. We really only complain and storm\nso long as we hope either to affect others or to excite ourselves to\nunheard-of efforts. But children and grown-up people know very well to\nyield contentedly as soon as they clearly see that it absolutely cannot be\notherwise:—Θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλον δαμάσσαντες ἀνάγκη (_Animo in\npectoribus nostro domito necessitate_). We are like the entrapped\nelephants, that rage and struggle for many days, till they see that it is\nuseless, and then suddenly offer their necks quietly to the yoke, tamed\nfor ever. We are like King David, who, as long as his son still lived,\nunceasingly importuned Jehovah with prayers, and behaved himself as if in\ndespair; but as soon as his son was dead, thought no longer about it.\nHence it arises that innumerable permanent ills, such as lameness,\npoverty, low estate, ugliness, a disagreeable dwelling-place, are borne\nwith indifference by innumerable persons, and are no longer felt, like\nhealed wounds, just because these persons know that inward or outward\nnecessity renders it impossible that any change can take place in these\nthings; while those who are more fortunate cannot understand how such\nmisfortunes can be borne. Now as with outward necessity, so also with\ninward; nothing reconciles so thoroughly as a distinct knowledge of it. If\nwe have once for all distinctly recognised not only our good qualities and\nour strength, but also our defects and weakness, established our aim\naccordingly, and rest satisfied concerning what cannot be attained, we\nthus escape in the surest way, as far as our individuality permits, the\nbitterest of all sorrows, discontentment with ourselves, which is the\ninevitable result of ignorance of our own individuality, of false conceit\nand the audacity that proceeds from it. To the bitter chapter of the\nself-knowledge here recommended the lines of Ovid admit of excellent\napplication—\n\n    “_Optimus ille animi v\n\nSo much with regard to the _acquired character_, which, indeed, is not of\nso much importance for ethics proper as for life in the world. But its\ninvestigation was related as that of a third species to the investigation\nof the intelligible and the empirical character, in regard to which we\nwere obliged to enter upon a somewhat detailed inquiry in order to bring\nout clearly how in all its phenomena the will is subject to necessity,\nwhile yet in itself it may be called free and even omnipotent.",

    "page_content": "visible world exists and progressively develops in accordance with the\nlaws which belong to the form of knowledge, can now, at the point at which\nin its most perfect manifestation it has attained to the completely\nadequate knowledge of its own nature, express itself anew in two ways.\nEither it wills here, at the summit of mental endowment and\nself-consciousness, simply what it willed before blindly and\nunconsciously, and if so, knowledge always remains its _motive_ in the\nwhole as in the particular case. Or, conversely, this knowledge becomes\nfor it a _quieter_, which appeases and suppresses all willing. This is\nthat assertion and denial of the will to live which was stated above in\ngeneral terms. As, in the reference of individual conduct, a general, not\na particular manifestation of will, it does not disturb and modify the\ndevelopment of the character, nor does it find its expression in\nparticular actions; but, either by an ever more marked appearance of the\nwhole method of action it has followed hitherto, or conversely by the\nentire suppression of it, it expresses in a living form the maxims which\nthe will has freely adopted in accordance with the knowledge it has now\nattained to. By the explanations we have just given of freedom, necessity,\nand character, we have somewhat facilitated and prepared the way for the\nclearer development of all this, which is the principal subject of this\nlast book. But we shall have done so still more when we have turned our\nattention to life itself, the willing or not willing of which is the great\nquestion, and have endeavoured to find out generally what the will itself,\nwhich is everywhere the inmost nature of this life, will really attain by\nits assertion—in what way and to what extent this assertion satisfies or\ncan satisfy the will; in short, what is generally and mainly to be\nregarded as its position in this its own world, which in every relation\nbelongs to it.\n\nFirst of all, I wish the reader to recall the passage with which we closed\nthe Second Book,—a passage occasioned by the question, which met us then,\nas to the end and aim of the will. Instead of the answer to this question,\nit appeared clearly before us how, in all the grades of its manifestation,\nfrom the lowest to the highest, the will dispenses altogether with a final\ngoal and aim. It always strives, for striving is its sole nature, which no\nattained goal can put an end to. Therefore it is not susceptible of any\nfinal satisfaction, but can only be restrained by hindrances, while in\nitself it goes on for ever. We see this in the simplest of all natural\nphenomena, gravity, which does not cease to strive and press towards a\nmathematical centre to reach which would be the annihilation both of\nitself and matter, and would not cease even if the whole universe were\nalready rolled into one ball. We see it in the other simple natural\nphenomena. A solid tends towards fluidity either by melting or dissolving,\nfor only so will its chemical forces be free; rigidity is the imprisonment\nin which it is held by cold. The fluid tends towards the gaseous state,\ninto which it passes at once as soon as all pressure is removed from it.\nNo body is without relationship, _i.e._, without tendency or without\ndesire and longing, as Jacob Böhme would say. Electricity transmits its\ninner self-repulsion to infinity, though the mass of the earth absorbs the\neffect. Galvanism is certainly, so long as the pile is working, an\naimless, unceasingly repeated act of repulsion and attraction. The\nexistence of the plant is just such a restless, never satisfied striving,\na ceaseless tendency through ever-ascending forms, till the end, the seed,\nbecomes a new starting-point; and this repeated _ad infinitum_—nowhere an\nend, nowhere a final satisfaction, nowhere a resting-place. It will also\nbe remembered, from the Second Book, that the multitude of natural forces\nand organised forms everywhere strive with each other for the matter in\nwhich they desire to appear, for each of them only possesses what it has\nwrested from the others; and thus a constant internecine war is waged,\nfrom which, for the most part, arises the resistance through which that\nstriving, which constitutes the inner nature of everything, is at all\npoints hindered; struggles in vain, yet, from its nature, cannot leave\noff; toils on laboriously till this phenomenon dies, when others eagerly\nseize its place and its matter.\n\nWe have long since recognised this striving, which constitutes the kernel\nand in-itself of everything, as identical with that which in us, where it\nmanifests itself most distinctly in the light of the fullest\nconsciousness, is called _will_. Its hindrance through an obstacle which\nplaces itself between it and its temporary aim we call _suffering_, and,\non the other hand, its attainment of the end satisfaction, wellbeing,\nhappiness. We may also transfer this terminology to the phenomena of the\nunconscious world, for though weaker in degree, they are identical in\nnature. Then we see them involved in constant suffering, and without any\ncontinuing happiness. For all effort springs from defect—from discontent\nwith one’s estate—is thus suffering so long as it is not satisfied; but no\nsatisfaction is lasting, rather it is always merely the starting-point of\na new effort. The striving we see everywhere hindered in many ways,\neverywhere in conflict, and therefore always under the form of suffering.\nThus, if there is no final end of striving, there is no measure and end of\nsuffering.\n\nBut what we only discover in unconscious Nature by sharpened observation,\nand with an effort, presents itself distinctly to us in the intelligent\nworld in the life of animals, whose constant suffering is easily proved.\nBut without lingering over these intermediate grades, we shall turn to the\nlife of man, in which all this appears with the greatest distinctness,\nilluminated by the clearest knowledge; for as the phenomenon of will\nbecomes more complete, the suffering also becomes more and more apparent.\nIn the plant there is as yet no sensibility, and therefore no pain. A\ncertain very small degree of suffering is experienced by the lowest\nspecies of animal life—infusoria and radiata; even in insects the capacity\nto feel and suffer is still limited. It first appears in a high degree\nwith the complete nervous system of vertebrate animals, and always in a\nhigher degree the more intelligence develops. Thus, in proportion as\nknowledge attains to distinctness, as consciousness ascends, pain also\nincreases, and therefore reaches its highest degree in man. And then,\nagain, the more distinctly a man knows, the more intelligent he is, the\nmore pain he has; the man who is gifted with genius suffers most of all.\nIn this sense, that is, with reference to the degree of knowledge in\ngeneral, not mere abstract rational knowledge, I understand and use here\nthat saying of the Preacher: _Qui auget scientiam, auget at dolorem._ That\nphilosophical painter or painting philosopher, Tischbein, has very\nbeautifully expressed the accurate relation between the degree of\nconsciousness and that of suffering by exhibiting it in a visible and\nclear form in a drawing. The upper half of his drawing represents women\nwhose children have been stolen, and who in different groups and\nattitudes, express in many ways deep maternal pain, anguish, and despair.\nThe lower half of the drawing represents sheep whose lambs have been taken\naway. They are arranged and grouped in precisely the same way; so that\nevery human head, every human attitude of the upper half, has below a\nbrute head and attitude corresponding to it. Thus we see distinctly how\nthe pain which is possible in the dull brute consciousness is related to\nthe violent grief, which only becomes possible through distinctness of\nknowledge and clearness of consciousness.\n\nWe desire to consider in this way, in _human existence_, the inner and\nessential destiny of will. Every one will easily recognise that same\ndestiny expressed in various degrees in the life of the brutes, only more\nweakly, and may also convince himself to his own satisfaction, from the\nsuffering animal world, _how essential to all life is suffering_.",

    "page_content": "an individual. The human individual finds himself as finite in infinite\nspace and time, and consequently as a vanishing quantity compared with\nthem. He is projected into them, and, on account of their unlimited\nnature, he has always a merely relative, never absolute _when_ and _where_\nof his existence; for his place and duration are finite parts of what is\ninfinite and boundless. His real existence is only in the present, whose\nunchecked flight into the past is a constant transition into death, a\nconstant dying. For his past life, apart from its possible consequences\nfor the present, and the testimony regarding the will that is expressed in\nit, is now entirely done with, dead, and no longer anything; and,\ntherefore, it must be, as a matter of reason, indifferent to him whether\nthe content of that past was pain or pleasure. But the present is always\npassing through his hands into the past; the future is quite uncertain and\nalways short. Thus his existence, even when we consider only its formal\nside, is a constant hurrying of the present into the dead past, a constant\ndying. But if we look at it from the physical side; it is clear that, as\nour walking is admittedly merely a constantly prevented falling, the life\nof our body is only a constantly prevented dying, an ever-postponed death:\nfinally, in the same way, the activity of our mind is a constantly\ndeferred ennui. Every breath we draw wards off the death that is\nconstantly intruding upon us. In this way we fight with it every moment,\nand again, at longer intervals, through every meal we eat, every sleep we\ntake, every time we warm ourselves, &c. In the end, death must conquer,\nfor we became subject to him through birth, and he only plays for a little\nwhile with his prey before he swallows it up. We pursue our life, however,\nwith great interest and much solicitude as long as possible, as we blow\nout a soap-bubble as long and as large as possible, although we know\nperfectly well that it will burst.\n\nWe saw that the inner being of unconscious nature is a constant striving\nwithout end and without rest. And this appears to us much more distinctly\nwhen we consider the nature of brutes and man. Willing and striving is its\nwhole being, which may be very well compared to an unquenchable thirst.\nBut the basis of all willing is need, deficiency, and thus pain.\nConsequently, the nature of brutes and man is subject to pain originally\nand through its very being. If, on the other hand, it lacks objects of\ndesire, because it is at once deprived of them by a too easy satisfaction,\na terrible void and ennui comes over it, _i.e._, its being and existence\nitself becomes an unbearable burden to it. Thus its life swings like a\npendulum backwards and forwards between pain and ennui. This has also had\nto express itself very oddly in this way; after man had transferred all\npain and torments to hell, there then remained nothing over for heaven but\nennui.\n\nBut the constant striving which constitutes the inner nature of every\nmanifestation of will obtains its primary and most general foundation at\nthe higher grades of objectification, from the fact that here the will\nmanifests itself as a living body, with the iron command to nourish it;\nand what gives strength to this command is just that this body is nothing\nbut the objectified will to live itself. Man, as the most complete\nobjectification of that will, is in like measure also the most necessitous\nof all beings: he is through and through concrete willing and needing; he\nis a concretion of a thousand necessities. With these he stands upon the\nearth, left to himself, uncertain about everything except his own need and\nmisery. Consequently the care for the maintenance of that existence under\nexacting demands, which are renewed every day, occupies, as a rule, the\nwhole of human life. To this is directly related the second claim, that of\nthe propagation of the species. At the same time he is threatened from all\nsides by the most different kinds of dangers, from which it requires\nconstant watchfulness to escape. With cautious steps and casting anxious\nglances round him he pursues his path, for a thousand accidents and a\nthousand enemies lie in wait for him. Thus he went while yet a savage,\nthus he goes in civilised life; there is no security for him.\n\n    “_Qualibus in tenebris vitæ, quantisque periclis_\n    _Degitur hocc’ ævi, quodcunque est!_”—LUCR. ii. 15.\n\nThe life of the great majority is only a constant struggle for this\nexistence itself, with the certainty of losing it at last. But what\nenables them to endure this wearisome battle is not so much the love of\nlife as the fear of death, which yet stands in the background as\ninevitable, and may come upon them at any moment. Life itself is a sea,\nfull of rocks and whirlpools, which man avoids with the greatest care and\nsolicitude, although he knows that even if he succeeds in getting through\nwith all his efforts and skill, he yet by doing so comes nearer at every\nstep to the greatest, the total, inevitable, and irremediable shipwreck,\ndeath; nay, even steers right upon it: this is the final goal of the\nlaborious voyage, and worse for him than all the rocks from which he has\nescaped.\n\nNow it is well worth observing that, on the one hand, the suffering and\nmisery of life may easily increase to such an extent that death itself, in\nthe flight from which the whole of life consists, becomes desirable, and\nwe hasten towards it voluntarily; and again, on the other hand, that as\nsoon as want and suffering permit rest to a man, ennui is at once so near\nthat he necessarily requires diversion. The striving after existence is\nwhat occupies all living things and maintains them in motion. But when\nexistence is assured, then they know not what to do with it; thus the\nsecond thing that sets them in motion is the effort to get free from the\nburden of existence, to make it cease to be felt, “to kill time,” _i.e._,\nto escape from ennui. Accordingly we see that almost all men who are\nsecure from want and care, now that at last they have thrown off all other\nburdens, become a burden to themselves, and regard as a gain every hour\nthey succeed in getting through; and thus every diminution of the very\nlife which, till then, they have employed all their powers to maintain as\nlong as possible. Ennui is by no means an evil to be lightly esteemed; in\nthe end it depicts on the countenance real despair. It makes beings who\nlove each other so little as men do, seek each other eagerly, and thus\nbecomes the source of social intercourse. Moreover, even from motives of\npolicy, public precautions are everywhere taken against it, as against\nother universal calamities. For this evil may drive men to the greatest\nexcesses, just as much as its opposite extreme, famine: the people require\n_panem et circenses_. The strict penitentiary system of Philadelphia makes\nuse of ennui alone as a means of punishment, through solitary confinement\nand idleness, and it is found so terrible that it has even led prisoners\nto commit suicide. As want is the constant scourge of the people, so ennui\nis that of the fashionable world. In middle-class life ennui is\nrepresented by the Sunday, and want by the six week-days.\n\nThus between desiring and attaining all human life flows on throughout.\nThe wish is, in its nature, pain; the attainment soon begets satiety: the\nend was only apparent; possession takes away the charm; the wish, the\nneed, presents itself under a new form; when it does not, then follows\ndesolateness, emptiness, ennui, against which the conflict is just as\npainful as against want. That wish and satisfaction should follow each\nother neither too quickly nor too slowly reduces the suffering, which both\noccasion to the smallest amount, and constitutes the happiest life. For\nthat which we might otherwise call the most beautiful part of life, its\npurest joy, if it were only because it lifts us out of real existence and\ntransforms us into disinterested spectators of it—that is, pure knowledge,\nwhich is foreign to all willing, the pleasure of the beautiful, the true\ndelight in art—this is granted only to a very few, because it demands rare\ntalents, and to these few only as a passing dream. And then, even these\nfew, on account of their higher intellectual power, are made susceptible\nof far greater suffering than duller minds can ever feel, and are also\nplaced in lonely isolation by a nature which is obviously different from\nthat of others; thus here also accounts are squared. But to the great\nmajority of men purely intellectual pleasures are not accessible. They are\nalmost quite incapable of the joys which lie in pure knowledge. They are\nentirely given up to willing. If, therefore, anything is to win their\nsympathy, to be _interesting_ to them, it must (as is implied in the\nmeaning of the word) in some way excite their _will_, even if it is only\nthrough a distant and merely problematical relation to it; the will must\nnot be left altogether out of the question, for their existence lies far\nmore in willing than in knowing,—action and reaction is their one element.\nWe may find in trifles and everyday occurrences the naïve expressions of\nthis quality. Thus, for example, at any place worth seeing they may visit,\nthey write their names, in order thus to react, to affect the place since\nit does not affect them. Again, when they see a strange rare animal, they\ncannot easily confine themselves to merely observing it; they must rouse\nit, tease it, play with it, merely to experience action and reaction; but\nthis need for excitement of the will manifests itself very specially in\nthe discovery and support of card-playing, which is quite peculiarly the\nexpression of the miserable side of humanity.\n\nBut whatever nature and fortune may have done, whoever a man be and\nwhatever he may possess, the pain which is essential to life cannot be\nthrown off:—Πηλειδης δ᾽ ῳμωξεν, ιδων εις ουρανον ευρυν (_Pelides autem\nejulavit, intuitus in cælum latum_). And again:—Ζηνος μεν παις ηα\nΚρονιονος, αυταρ οιζυν ειχον απειρεσιην (_Jovis quidem filius eram\nSaturnii; verum ærumnam habebam infinitam_). The ceaseless efforts to\nbanish suffering accomplish no more than to make it change its form. It is\nessentially deficiency, want, care for the maintenance of life. If we\nsucceed, which is very difficult, in removing pain in this form, it\nimmediately assumes a thousand others, varying according to age and\ncircumstances, such as lust, passionate love, jealousy, envy, hatred,\nanxiety, ambition, covetousness, sickness, &c., &c. If at last it can find\nentrance in no other form, it comes in the sad, grey garments of\ntediousness and ennui, against which we then strive in various ways. If\nfinally we succeed in driving this away, we shall hardly do so without\nletting pain enter in one of its earlier forms, and the dance begin again\nfrom the beginning; for all human life is tossed backwards and forwards\nbetween pain and ennui. Depressing as this view of life is, I will draw\nattention, by the way, to an aspect of it from which consolation may be\ndrawn, and perhaps even a stoical indifference to one’s own present ills\nmay be attained. For our impatience at these arises for the most part from\nthe fact that we regard them as brought about by a chain of causes which\nmight easily be different. We do not generally grieve over ills which are\ndirectly necessary and quite universal; for example, the necessity of age\nand of death, and many daily inconveniences. It is rather the\nconsideration of the accidental nature of the circumstances that brought\nsome sorrow just to us, that gives it its sting. But if we have recognised\nthat pain, as such, is inevitable and essential to life, and that nothing\ndepends upon chance but its mere fashion, the form under which it presents\nitself, that thus our present sorrow fills a place that, without it, would\nat once be occupied by another which now is excluded by it, and that\ntherefore fate can affect us little in what is essential; such a\nreflection, if it were to become a living conviction, might produce a\nconsiderable degree of stoical equanimity, and very much lessen the\nanxious care for our own well-being. But, in fact, such a powerful control\nof reason over directly felt suffering seldom or never occurs.\n\nBesides, through this view of the inevitableness of pain, of the\nsupplanting of one pain by another, and the introduction of a new pain\nthrough the passing away of that which preceded it, one might be led to\nthe paradoxical but not absurd hypothesis, that in every individual the\nmeasure of the pain essential to him was determined once for all by his\nnature, a measure which could neither remain empty, nor be more than\nfilled, however much the form of the suffering might change. Thus his\nsuffering and well-being would by no means be determined from without, but\nonly through that measure, that natural disposition, which indeed might\nexperience certain additions and diminutions from the physical condition\nat different times, but yet, on the whole, would remain the same, and\nwould just be what is called the temperament, or, more accurately, the\ndegree in which he might be ευκολος or δυσκολος, as Plato expresses it in\nthe First Book of the Republic, _i.e._, in an easy or difficult mood. This\nhypothesis is supported not only by the well-known experience that great\nsuffering makes all lesser ills cease to be felt, and conversely that\nfreedom from great suffering makes even the most trifling inconveniences\ntorment us and put us out of humour; but experience also teaches that if a\ngreat misfortune, at the mere thought of which we shuddered, actually\nbefalls us, as soon as we have overcome the first pain of it, our\ndisposition remains for the most part unchanged; and, conversely, that\nafter the attainment of some happiness we have long desired, we do not\nfeel ourselves on the whole and permanently very much better off and\nagreeably situated than before. Only the moment at which these changes\noccur affects us with unusual strength, as deep sorrow or exulting joy,\nbut both soon pass away, for they are based upon illusion. For they do not\nspring from the immediately present pleasure or pain, but only from the\nopening up of a new future which is anticipated in them. Only by borrowing\nfrom the future could pain or pleasure be heightened so abnormally, and\nconsequently not enduringly. It would follow, from the hypothesis\nadvanced, that a large part of the feeling of suffering and of well-being\nwould be subjective and determined _a priori_, as is the case with\nknowing; and we may add the following remarks as evidence in favour of it.\nHuman cheerfulness or dejection are manifestly not determined by external\ncircumstances, such as wealth and position, for we see at least as many\nglad faces among the poor as among the rich. Further, the motives which\ninduce suicide are so very different, that we can assign no motive that is\nso great as to bring it about, even with great probability, in every\ncharacter, and few that would be so small that the like of them had never\ncaused it. Now although the degree of our serenity or sadness is not at\nall times the same, yet, in consequence of this view, we shall not\nattribute it to the change of outward circumstances, but to that of the\ninner condition, the physical state. For when an actual, though only\ntemporary, increase of our serenity, even to the extent of joyfulness,\ntakes place, it usually appears without any external occasion. It is true\nthat we often see our pain arise only from some definite external\nrelation, and are visibly oppressed and saddened by this only. Then we\nbelieve that if only this were taken away, the greatest contentment would\nnecessarily ensue. But this is illusion. The measure of our pain and our\nhappiness is on the whole, according to our hypothesis, subjectively\ndetermined for each point of time, and the motive for sadness is related\nto that, just as a blister which draws to a head all the bad humours\notherwise distributed is related to the body. The pain which is at that\nperiod of time essential to our nature, and therefore cannot be shaken\noff, would, without the definite external cause of our suffering, be\ndivided at a hundred points, and appear in the form of a hundred little\nannoyances and cares about things which we now entirely overlook, because\nour capacity for pain is already filled by that chief evil which has\nconcentrated in a point all the suffering otherwise dispersed. This\ncorresponds also to the observation that if a great and pressing care is\nlifted from our breast by its fortunate issue, another immediately takes\nits place, the whole material of which was already there before, yet could\nnot come into consciousness as care because there was no capacity left for\nit, and therefore this material of care remained indistinct and unobserved\nin a cloudy form on the farthest horizon of consciousness. But now that\nthere is room, this prepared material at once comes forward and occupies\nthe throne of the reigning care of the day (πρυτανευουσα). And if it is\nvery much lighter in its matter than the material of the care which has\nvanished, it knows how to blow itself out so as apparently to equal it in\nsize, and thus, as the chief care of the day, completely fills the throne.\n\nExcessive joy and very keen suffering always occur in the same person, for\nthey condition each other reciprocally, and are also in common conditioned\nby great activity of the mind. Both are produced, as we have just seen,\nnot by what is really present, but by the anticipation of the future. But\nsince pain is essential to life, and its degree is also determined by the\nnature of the subject, sudden changes, because they are always external,\ncannot really alter its degree. Thus an error and delusion always lies at\nthe foundation of immoderate joy or grief, and consequently both these\nexcessive strainings of the mind can be avoided by knowledge. Every\nimmoderate joy (_exultatio, insolens lætitia_) always rests on the\ndelusion that one has found in life what can never be found there—lasting\nsatisfaction of the harassing desires and cares, which are constantly\nbreeding new ones. From every particular delusion of this kind one must\ninevitably be brought back later, and then when it vanishes must pay for\nit with pain as bitter as the joy its entrance caused was keen. So far,\nthen, it is precisely like a height from which one can come down only by a\nfall. Therefore one ought to avoid them; and every sudden excessive grief\nis just a fall from some such height, the vanishing of such a delusion,\nand so conditioned by it. Consequently we might avoid them both if we had\nsufficient control over ourselves to survey things always with perfect\nclearness as a whole and in their connection, and steadfastly to guard\nagainst really lending them the colours which we wish they had. The\nprincipal effort of the Stoical ethics was to free the mind from all such\ndelusion and its consequences, and to give it instead an equanimity that\ncould not be disturbed. It is this insight that inspires Horace in the\nwell-known ode—\n\n    “_Æquam memento rebus in arduiis_\n    Servare mentem, non secus in bonis\n        _Ab insolenti temperatam_\n          _Lætitia._”\n\nFor the most part, however, we close our minds against the knowledge,\nwhich may be compared to a bitter medicine, that suffering is essential to\nlife, and therefore does not flow in upon us from without, but that every\none carries about with him its perennial source in his own heart. We\nrather seek constantly for an external particular cause, as it were, a\npretext for the pain which never leaves us, just as the free man makes\nhimself an idol, in order to have a master. For we unweariedly strive from\nwish to wish; and although every satisfaction, however much it promised,\nwhen attained fails to satisfy us, but for the most part comes presently\nto be an error of which we are ashamed, yet we do not see that we draw\nwater with the sieve of the Danaides, but ever hasten to new desires.\n\n    “_Sed, dum abest quod avemus, id exsuperare videtur_\n    _Cætera; post aliud, quum contigit illud, avemus;_\n    _Et sitis æqua tenet vitai semper hiantes._”—LUCR. iii. 1095.\n\nThus it either goes on for ever, or, what is more rare and presupposes a\ncertain strength of character, till we reach a wish which is not satisfied\nand yet cannot be given up. In that case we have, as it were, found what\nwe sought, something that we can always blame, instead of our own nature,\nas the source of our suffering. And thus, although we are now at variance\nwith our fate, we are reconciled to our existence, for the knowledge is\nagain put far from us that suffering is essential to this existence\nitself, and true satisfaction impossible. The result of this form of\ndevelopment is a somewhat melancholy disposition, the constant endurance\nof a single great pain, and the contempt for all lesser sorrows or joys\nthat proceeds from it; consequently an already nobler phenomenon than that\nconstant seizing upon ever-new forms of illusion, which is much more\ncommon.",

But when finally\neverything is overcome and attained, nothing can ever be gained but\ndeliverance from some sorrow or desire, so that we find ourselves just in\nthe same position as we occupied before this sorrow or desire appeared.\nAll that is even directly given us is merely the want, _i.e._, the pain.\nThe satisfaction and the pleasure we can only know indirectly through the\nremembrance of the preceding suffering and want, which ceases with its\nappearance. Hence it arises that we are not properly conscious of the\nblessings and advantages we actually possess, nor do we prize them, but\nthink of them merely as a matter of course, for they gratify us only\nnegatively by restraining suffering. Only when we have lost them do we\nbecome sensible of their value; for the want, the privation, the sorrow,\nis the positive, communicating itself directly to us. Thus also we are\npleased by the remembrance of past need, sickness, want, and such like,\nbecause this is the only means of enjoying the present blessings. And,\nfurther, it cannot be denied that in this respect, and from this\nstandpoint of egoism, which is the form of the will to live, the sight or\nthe description of the sufferings of others affords us satisfaction and\npleasure in precisely the way Lucretius beautifully and frankly expresses\nit in the beginning of the Second Book—\n\n    “_Suave, mari magno, turbantibus æquora ventis,_\n    _E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem:_\n    _Non, quia vexari quemquam est jucunda voluptas;_\n    _Sed, quibus ipse malis careas, quia cernere suave est._”\n\nYet we shall see farther on that this kind of pleasure, through knowledge\nof our own well-being obtained in this way, lies very near the source of\nreal, positive wickedness.\n\nThat all happiness is only of a negative not a positive nature, that just\non this account it cannot be lasting satisfaction and gratification, but\nmerely delivers us from some pain or want which must be followed either by\na new pain, or by languor, empty longing, and ennui; this finds support in\nart, that true mirror of the world and life, and especially in poetry.\nEvery epic and dramatic poem can only represent a struggle, an effort, and\nfight for happiness, never enduring and complete happiness itself. It\nconducts its heroes through a thousand difficulties and dangers to the\ngoal; as soon as this is reached, it hastens to let the curtain fall; for\nnow there would remain nothing for it to do but to show that the\nglittering goal in which the hero expected to find happiness had only\ndisappointed him, and that after its attainment he was no better off than\nbefore. Because a genuine enduring happiness is not possible, it cannot be\nthe subject of art. Certainly the aim of the idyll is the description of\nsuch a happiness, but one also sees that the idyll as such cannot\ncontinue. The poet always finds that it either becomes epical in his\nhands, and in this case it is a very insignificant epic, made up of\ntrifling sorrows, trifling delights, and trifling efforts—this is the\ncommonest case—or else it becomes a merely descriptive poem, describing\nthe beauty of nature, _i.e._, pure knowing free from will, which\ncertainly, as a matter of fact, is the only pure happiness, which is\nneither preceded by suffering or want, nor necessarily followed by\nrepentance, sorrow, emptiness, or satiety; but this happiness cannot fill\nthe whole life, but is only possible at moments. What we see in poetry we\nfind again in music; in the melodies of which we have recognised the\nuniversal expression of the inmost history of the self-conscious will, the\nmost secret life, longing, suffering, and delight; the ebb and flow of the\nhuman heart. Melody is always a deviation from the keynote through a\nthousand capricious wanderings, even to the most painful discord, and then\na final return to the keynote which expresses the satisfaction and\nappeasing of the will, but with which nothing more can then be done, and\nthe continuance of which any longer would only be a wearisome and\nunmeaning monotony corresponding to ennui.\n\nAll that we intend to bring out clearly through these investigations, the\nimpossibility of attaining lasting satisfaction and the negative nature of\nall happiness, finds its explanation in what is shown at the conclusion of\nthe Second Book: that the will, of which human life, like every\nphenomenon, is the objectification, is a striving without aim or end. We\nfind the stamp of this endlessness imprinted upon all the parts of its\nwhole manifestation, from its most universal form, endless time and space,\nup to the most perfect of all phenomena, the life and efforts of man. We\nmay theoretically assume three extremes of human life, and treat them as\nelements of actual human life. First, the powerful will, the strong\npassions (Radscha-Guna). It appears in great historical characters; it is\ndescribed in the epic and the drama. But it can also show itself in the\nlittle world, for the size of the objects is measured here by the degree\nin which they influence the will, not according to their external\nrelations. Secondly, pure knowing, the comprehension of the Ideas,\nconditioned by the freeing of knowledge from the service of will: the life\nof genius (Satwa-Guna). Thirdly and lastly, the greatest lethargy of the\nwill, and also of the knowledge attaching to it, empty longing,\nlife-benumbing languor (Tama-Guna). The life of the individual, far from\nbecoming permanently fixed in one of these extremes, seldom touches any of\nthem, and is for the most part only a weak and wavering approach to one or\nthe other side, a needy desiring of trifling objects, constantly\nrecurring, and so escaping ennui. It is really incredible how meaningless\nand void of significance when looked at from without, how dull and\nunenlightened by intellect when felt from within, is the course of the\nlife of the great majority of men. It is a weary longing and complaining,\na dream-like staggering through the four ages of life to death,\naccompanied by a series of trivial thoughts. Such men are like clockwork,\nwhich is wound up, and goes it knows not why; and every time a man is\nbegotten and born, the clock of human life is wound up anew, to repeat the\nsame old piece it has played innumerable times before, passage after\npassage, measure after measure, with insignificant variations. Every\nindividual, every human being and his course of life, is but another short\ndream of the endless spirit of nature, of the persistent will to live; is\nonly another fleeting form, which it carelessly sketches on its infinite\npage, space and time; allows to remain for a time so short that it\nvanishes into nothing in comparison with these, and then obliterates to\nmake new room. And yet, and here lies the serious side of life, every one\nof these fleeting forms, these empty fancies, must be paid for by the\nwhole will to live, in all its activity, with many and deep sufferings,\nand finally with a bitter death, long feared and coming at last. This is\nwhy the sight of a corpse makes us suddenly so serious.\n\nThe life of every individual, if we survey it as a whole and in general,\nand only lay stress upon its most significant features, is really always a\ntragedy, but gone through in detail, it has the character of a comedy. For\nthe deeds and vexations of the day, the restless irritation of the moment,\nthe desires and fears of the week, the mishaps of every hour, are all\nthrough chance, which is ever bent upon some jest, scenes of a comedy. But\nthe never-satisfied wishes, the frustrated efforts, the hopes unmercifully\ncrushed by fate, the unfortunate errors of the whole life, with increasing\nsuffering and death at the end, are always a tragedy. Thus, as if fate\nwould add derision to the misery of our existence, our life must contain\nall the woes of tragedy, and yet we cannot even assert the dignity of\ntragic characters, but in the broad detail of life must inevitably be the\nfoolish characters of a comedy.\n\nBut however much great and small trials may fill human life, they are not\nable to conceal its insufficiency to satisfy the spirit; they cannot hide\nthe emptiness and superficiality of existence, nor exclude ennui, which is\nalways ready to fill up every pause that care may allow. Hence it arises\nthat the human mind, not content with the cares, anxieties, and\noccupations which the actual world lays upon it, creates for itself an\nimaginary world also in the form of a thousand different superstitions,\nthen finds all manner of employment with this, and wastes time and\nstrength upon it, as soon as the real world is willing to grant it the\nrest which it is quite incapable of enjoying. This is accordingly most\nmarkedly the case with nations for which life is made easy by the\ncongenial nature of the climate and the soil, most of all with the Hindus,\nthen with the Greeks, the Romans, and later with the Italians, the\nSpaniards, &c. Demons, gods, and saints man creates in his own image; and\nto them he must then unceasingly bring offerings, prayers, temple\ndecorations, vows and their fulfilment, pilgrimages, salutations,\nornaments for their images, &c. Their service mingles everywhere with the\nreal, and, indeed, obscures it. Every event of life is regarded as the\nwork of these beings; the intercourse with them occupies half the time of\nlife, constantly sustains hope, and by the charm of illusion often becomes\nmore interesting than intercourse with real beings. It is the expression\nand symptom of the actual need of mankind, partly for help and support,\npartly for occupation and diversion; and if it often works in direct\nopposition to the first need, because when accidents and dangers arise\nvaluable time and strength, instead of being directed to warding them off,\nare uselessly wasted on prayers and offerings; it serves the second end\nall the better by this imaginary converse with a visionary spirit world;\nand this is the by no means contemptible gain of all superstitions.",

    "page_content": "general consideration, by investigation of the primary and elemental\nfeatures of human life, that in its whole plan it is capable of no true\nblessedness, but is in its very nature suffering in various forms, and\nthroughout a state of misery, we might now awaken this conviction much\nmore vividly within us if, proceeding more _a posteriori_, we were to turn\nto more definite instances, call up pictures to the fancy, and illustrate\nby examples the unspeakable misery which experience and history present,\nwherever one may look and in whatever direction one may seek. But the\nchapter would have no end, and would carry us far from the standpoint of\nthe universal, which is essential to philosophy; and, moreover, such a\ndescription might easily be taken for a mere declamation on human misery,\nsuch as has often been given, and, as such, might be charged with\none-sidedness, because it started from particular facts. From such a\nreproach and suspicion our perfectly cold and philosophical investigation\nof the inevitable suffering which is founded in the nature of life is\nfree, for it starts from the universal and is conducted _a priori_. But\nconfirmation _a posteriori_ is everywhere easily obtained. Every one who\nhas awakened from the first dream of youth, who has considered his own\nexperience and that of others, who has studied himself in life, in the\nhistory of the past and of his own time, and finally in the works of the\ngreat poets, will, if his judgment is not paralysed by some indelibly\nimprinted prejudice, certainly arrive at the conclusion that this human\nworld is the kingdom of chance and error, which rule without mercy in\ngreat things and in small, and along with which folly and wickedness also\nwield the scourge. Hence it arises that everything better only struggles\nthrough with difficulty; what is noble and wise seldom attains to\nexpression, becomes effective and claims attention, but the absurd and the\nperverse in the sphere of thought, the dull and tasteless in the sphere of\nart, the wicked and deceitful in the sphere of action, really assert a\nsupremacy, only disturbed by short interruptions. On the other hand,\neverything that is excellent is always a mere exception, one case in\nmillions, and therefore, if it presents itself in a lasting work, this,\nwhen it has outlived the enmity of its contemporaries, exists in\nisolation, is preserved like a meteoric stone, sprung from an order of\nthings different from that which prevails here. But as far as the life of\nthe individual is concerned, every biography is the history of suffering,\nfor every life is, as a rule, a continual series of great and small\nmisfortunes, which each one conceals as much as possible, because he knows\nthat others can seldom feel sympathy or compassion, but almost always\nsatisfaction at the sight of the woes from which they are themselves for\nthe moment exempt. But perhaps at the end of life, if a man is sincere and\nin full possession of his faculties, he will never wish to have it to live\nover again, but rather than this, he will much prefer absolute\nannihilation. The essential content of the famous soliloquy in “Hamlet” is\nbriefly this: Our state is so wretched that absolute annihilation would be\ndecidedly preferable. If suicide really offered us this, so that the\nalternative “to be or not to be,” in the full sense of the word, was\nplaced before us, then it would be unconditionally to be chosen as “a\nconsummation devoutly to be wished.” But there is something in us which\ntells us that this is not the case: suicide is not the end; death is not\nabsolute annihilation. In like manner, what was said by the father of\nhistory(71) has not since him been contradicted, that no man has ever\nlived who has not wished more than once that he had not to live the\nfollowing day. According to this, the brevity of life, which is so\nconstantly lamented, may be the best quality it possesses. If, finally, we\nshould bring clearly to a man’s sight the terrible sufferings and miseries\nto which his life is constantly exposed, he would be seized with horror;\nand if we were to conduct the confirmed optimist through the hospitals,\ninfirmaries, and surgical operating-rooms, through the prisons,\ntorture-chambers, and slave-kennels, over battle-fields and places of\nexecution; if we were to open to him all the dark abodes of misery, where\nit hides itself from the glance of cold curiosity, and, finally, allow him\nto glance into the starving dungeon of Ugolino, he, too, would understand\nat last the nature of this “best of possible worlds.” For whence did Dante\ntake the materials for his hell but from this our actual world? And yet he\nmade a very proper hell of it. And when, on the other hand, he came to the\ntask of describing heaven and its delights, he had an insurmountable\ndifficulty before him, for our world affords no materials at all for this.\nTherefore there remained nothing for him to do but, instead of describing\nthe joys of paradise, to repeat to us the instruction given him there by\nhis ancestor, by Beatrice, and by various saints. But from this it is\nsufficiently clear what manner of world it is. Certainly human life, like\nall bad ware, is covered over with a false lustre: what suffers always\nconceals itself; on the other hand, whatever pomp or splendour any one can\nget, he makes a show of openly, and the more inner contentment deserts\nhim, the more he desires to exist as fortunate in the opinion of others:\nto such an extent does folly go, and the opinion of others is a chief aim\nof the efforts of every one, although the utter nothingness of it is\nexpressed in the fact that in almost all languages vanity, _vanitas_,\noriginally signifies emptiness and nothingness. But under all this false\nshow, the miseries of life can so increase—and this happens every day—that\nthe death which hitherto has been feared above all things is eagerly\nseized upon. Indeed, if fate will show its whole malice, even this refuge\nis denied to the sufferer, and, in the hands of enraged enemies, he may\nremain exposed to terrible and slow tortures without remedy. In vain the\nsufferer then calls on his gods for help; he remains exposed to his fate\nwithout grace. But this irremediableness is only the mirror of the\ninvincible nature of his will, of which his person is the objectivity. As\nlittle as an external power can change or suppress this will, so little\ncan a foreign power deliver it from the miseries which proceed from the\nlife which is the phenomenal appearance of that will. In the principal\nmatter, as in everything else, a man is always thrown back upon himself.\nIn vain does he make to himself gods in order to get from them by prayers\nand flattery what can only be accomplished by his own will-power. The Old\nTestament made the world and man the work of a god, but the New Testament\nsaw that, in order to teach that holiness and salvation from the sorrows\nof this world can only come from the world itself, it was necessary that\nthis god should become man. It is and remains the will of man upon which\neverything depends for him. Fanatics, martyrs, saints of every faith and\nname, have voluntarily and gladly endured every torture, because in them\nthe will to live had suppressed itself; and then even the slow destruction\nof its phenomenon was welcome to them. But I do not wish to anticipate the\nlater exposition. For the rest, I cannot here avoid the statement that, to\nme, _optimism_, when it is not merely the thoughtless talk of such as\nharbour nothing but words under their low foreheads, appears not merely as\nan absurd, but also as a really _wicked_ way of thinking, as a bitter\nmockery of the unspeakable suffering of humanity. Let no one think that\nChristianity is favourable to optimism; for, on the contrary, in the\nGospels world and evil are used as almost synonymous.(72)",

    "page_content": "insert; the exposition of the freedom of the will in itself together with\nthe necessity of its phenomenon, and the exposition of its lot in the\nworld which reflects its own nature, and upon the knowledge of which it\nhas to assert or deny itself. Therefore we can now proceed to bring out\nmore clearly the nature of this assertion and denial itself, which was\nreferred to and explained in a merely general way above. This we shall do\nby exhibiting the conduct in which alone it finds its expression, and\nconsidering it in its inner significance.\n\nThe _assertion of the will_ is the continuous willing itself, undisturbed\nby any knowledge, as it fills the life of man in general. For even the\nbody of a man is the objectivity of the will, as it appears at this grade\nand in this individual. And thus his willing which develops itself in time\nis, as it were, a paraphrase of his body, an elucidation of the\nsignificance of the whole and its parts; it is another way of exhibiting\nthe same thing-in-itself, of which the body is already the phenomenon.\nTherefore, instead of saying assertion of the will, we may say assertion\nof the body. The fundamental theme or subject of all the multifarious acts\nof will is the satisfaction of the wants which are inseparable from the\nexistence of the body in health, they already have their expression in it,\nand may be referred to the maintenance of the individual and the\npropagation of the species. But indirectly the most different kinds of\nmotives obtain in this way power over the will, and bring about the most\nmultifarious acts of will. Each of these is only an example, an instance,\nof the will which here manifests itself generally. Of what nature this\nexample may be, what form the motive may have and impart to it, is not\nessential; the important point here is that something is willed in general\nand the degree of intensity with which it is so willed. The will can only\nbecome visible in the motives, as the eye only manifests its power of\nseeing in the light. The motive in general stands before the will in\nprotean forms. It constantly promises complete satisfaction, the quenching\nof the thirst of will. But whenever it is attained it at once appears in\nanother form, and thus influences the will anew, always according to the\ndegree of the intensity of this will, and its relation to knowledge which\nare revealed as empirical character, in these very examples and instances.\n\nFrom the first appearance of consciousness, a man finds himself a willing\nbeing, and as a rule, his knowledge remains in constant relation to his\nwill. He first seeks to know thoroughly the objects of his desire, and\nthen the means of attaining them. Now he knows what he has to do, and, as\na rule, he does not strive after other knowledge. He moves and acts; his\nconsciousness keeps him always working directly and actively towards the\naims of his will; his thought is concerned with the choice of motives.\nSuch is life for almost all men; they wish, they know what they wish, and\nthey strive after it, with sufficient success to keep them from despair,\nand sufficient failure to keep them from ennui and its consequences. From\nthis proceeds a certain serenity, or at least indifference, which cannot\nbe affected by wealth or poverty; for the rich and the poor do not enjoy\nwhat they have, for this, as we have shown, acts in a purely negative way,\nbut what they hope to attain to by their efforts. They press forward with\nmuch earnestness, and indeed with an air of importance; thus children also\npursue their play. It is always an exception if such a life suffers\ninterruption from the fact that either the æsthetic demand for\ncontemplation or the ethical demand for renunciation proceed from a\nknowledge which is independent of the service of the will, and directed to\nthe nature of the world in general. Most men are pursued by want all\nthrough life, without ever being allowed to come to their senses. On the\nother hand, the will is often inflamed to a degree that far transcends the\nassertion of the body, and then violent emotions and powerful passions\nshow themselves, in which the individual not only asserts his own\nexistence, but denies and seeks to suppress that of others when it stands\nin his way.\n\nThe maintenance of the body through its own powers is so small a degree of\nthe assertion of will, that if it voluntarily remains at this degree, we\nmight assume that, with the death of this body, the will also which\nappeared in it would be extinguished. But even the satisfaction of the\nsexual passions goes beyond the assertion of one’s own existence, which\nfills so short a time, and asserts life for an indefinite time after the\ndeath of the individual. Nature, always true and consistent, here even\nnaïve, exhibits to us openly the inner significance of the act of\ngeneration. Our own consciousness, the intensity of the impulse, teaches\nus that in this act the most decided _assertion of the will to live_\nexpresses itself, pure and without further addition (any denial of other\nindividuals); and now, as the consequence of this act, a new life appears\nin time and the causal series, _i.e._, in nature; the begotten appears\nbefore the begetter, different as regards the phenomenon, but in himself,\n_i.e._, according to the Idea, identical with him. Therefore it is this\nact through which every species of living creature binds itself to a whole\nand is perpetuated. Generation is, with reference to the begetter, only\nthe expression, the symptom, of his decided assertion of the will to live:\nwith reference to the begotten, it is not the cause of the will which\nappears in him, for the will in itself knows neither cause nor effect,\nbut, like all causes, it is merely the occasional cause of the phenomenal\nappearance of this will at this time in this place. As thing-in-itself,\nthe will of the begetter and that of the begotten are not different, for\nonly the phenomenon, not the thing-in-itself, is subordinate to the\n_principim individuationis_. With that assertion beyond our own body and\nextending to the production of a new body, suffering and death, as\nbelonging to the phenomenon of life, have also been asserted anew, and the\npossibility of salvation, introduced by the completest capability of\nknowledge, has for this time been shown to be fruitless. Here lies the\nprofound reason of the shame connected with the process of generation.\nThis view is mythically expressed in the dogma of Christian theology that\nwe are all partakers in Adam’s first transgression (which is clearly just\nthe satisfaction of sexual passion), and through it are guilty of\nsuffering and death. In this theology goes beyond the consideration of\nthings according to the principle of sufficient reason, and recognises the\nIdea of man, the unity of which is re-established out of its dispersion\ninto innumerable individuals through the bond of generation which holds\nthem all together. Accordingly it regards every individual as on one side\nidentical with Adam, the representative of the assertion of life, and, so\nfar, as subject to sin (original sin), suffering, and death; on the other\nside, the knowledge of the Idea of man enables it to regard every\nindividual as identical with the saviour, the representative of the denial\nof the will to live, and, so far as a partaker of his sacrifice of\nhimself, saved through his merits, and delivered from the bands of sin and\ndeath, _i.e._, the world (Rom. v. 12-21).\n\nAnother mythical exposition of our view of sexual pleasure as the\nassertion of the will to live beyond the individual life, as an attainment\nto life which is brought about for the first time by this means, or as it\nwere a renewed assignment of life, is the Greek myth of Proserpine, who\nmight return from the lower world so long as she had not tasted its fruit,\nbut who became subject to it altogether through eating the pomegranate.\nThis meaning appears very clearly in Goethe’s incomparable presentation of\nthis myth, especially when, as soon as she has tasted the pomegranate, the\ninvisible chorus of the Fates—\n\n                    “Thou art ours!\n    Fasting shouldest thou return:\n    And the bite of the apple makes thee ours!”\n\nIt is worth noticing that Clement of Alexandria (Strom. iii. c. 15)\nillustrates the matter with the same image and the same expression: Οἱ μεν\nευνουχισαντες ἑαυτους απο πασης ἁμαρτιας, δια την βασιλειαν, των ουρανων,\nμακαριοι οὑτοι εισιν, οἱ του κοσμου νηστευοντες; (_Qui se castrarunt ab\nomni peccato propter regnum cœlorum, ii sunt beati, a mundo jejunantes_).\n\nThe sexual impulse also proves itself the decided and strongest assertion\nof life by the fact that to man in a state of nature, as to the brutes, it\nis the final end, the highest goal of life. Self-maintenance is his first\neffort, and as soon as he has made provision for that, he only strives\nafter the propagation of the species: as a merely natural being he can\nattempt no more. Nature also, the inner being of which is the will to live\nitself, impels with all her power both man and the brute towards\npropagation. Then it has attained its end with the individual, and is\nquite indifferent to its death, for, as the will to live, it cares only\nfor the preservation of the species, the individual is nothing to it.\nBecause the will to live expresses itself most strongly in the sexual\nimpulse, the inner being of nature, the old poets and philosophers—Hesiod\nand Parmenides—said very significantly that Eros is the first, the\ncreator, the principle from which all things proceed. (Cf. Arist. Metaph.,\ni. 4.) Pherecydes said: Εις ερωτα μεταβεβλησθαι τον Δια, μελλοντα\nδημιουργειν (_Jovem, cum mundum fabricare vellet, in cupidinem sese\ntransformasse_). _Proclus ad Plat. Tim._, l. iii. A complete treatment of\nthis subject we have recently received from G. F. Schœmann, “_De Cupidine\nCosmogonico_,” 1852. The Mâya of the Hindus, whose work and web is the\nwhole world of illusion, is also symbolised by love.\n\nThe genital organs are, far more than any other external member of the\nbody, subject merely to the will, and not at all to knowledge. Indeed, the\nwill shows itself here almost as independent of knowledge, as in those\nparts which, acting merely in consequence of stimuli, are subservient to\nvegetative life and reproduction, in which the will works blindly as in\nunconscious nature. For generation is only reproduction passing over to a\nnew individual, as it were reproduction at the second power, as death is\nonly excretion at the second power. According to all this, the genitals\nare properly the _focus_ of will, and consequently the opposite pole of\nthe brain, the representative of knowledge, _i.e._, the other side of the\nworld, the world as idea. The former are the life-sustaining principle\nensuring endless life to time. In this respect they were worshipped by the\nGreeks in the _phallus_, and by the Hindus in the _lingam_, which are thus\nthe symbol of the assertion of the will. Knowledge, on the other hand,\naffords the possibility of the suppression of willing, of salvation\nthrough freedom, of conquest and annihilation of the world.\n\nWe already considered fully at the beginning of this Fourth Book how the\nwill to live in its assertion must regard its relation to death. We saw\nthat death does not trouble it, because it exists as something included in\nlife itself and belonging to it. Its opposite, generation, completely\ncounterbalances it; and, in spite of the death of the individual, ensures\nand guarantees life to the will to live through all time. To express this\nthe Hindus made the _lingam_ an attribute of Siva, the god of death. We\nalso fully explained there how he who with full consciousness occupies the\nstandpoint of the decided assertion of life awaits death without fear. We\nshall therefore say nothing more about this here. Without clear\nconsciousness most men occupy this standpoint and continually assert life.\nThe world exists as the mirror of this assertion, with innumerable\nindividuals in infinite time and space, in infinite suffering, between\ngeneration and death without end. Yet from no side is a complaint to be\nfurther raised about this; for the will conducts the great tragedy and\ncomedy at its own expense, and is also its own spectator. The world is\njust what it is because the will, whose manifestation it is, is what it\nis, because it so wills. The justification of suffering is, that in this\nphenomenon also the will asserts itself; and this assertion is justified\nand balanced by the fact that the will bears the suffering. Here we get a\nglimpse of _eternal justice_ in the whole: we shall recognise it later\nmore definitely and distinctly, and also in the particular. But first we\nmust consider temporal or human justice.(73)",

    "page_content": "nature, at all the grades of the objectification of will, there was a\nnecessary and constant conflict between the individuals of all species;\nand in this way was expressed the inner contradiction of the will to live\nwith itself. At the highest grade of the objectification, this phenomenon,\nlike all others, will exhibit itself with greater distinctness, and will\ntherefore be more easily explained. With this aim we shall next attempt to\ntrace the source of _egoism_ as the starting-point of all conflict.\n\nWe have called time and space the _principium individuationis_, because\nonly through them and in them is multiplicity of the homogeneous possible.\nThey are the essential forms of natural knowledge, _i.e._, knowledge\nspringing from the will. Therefore the will everywhere manifests itself in\nthe multiplicity of individuals. But this multiplicity does not concern\nthe will as thing-in-itself, but only its phenomena. The will itself is\npresent, whole and undivided, in every one of these, and beholds around it\nthe innumerably repeated image of its own nature; but this nature itself,\nthe actually real, it finds directly only in its inner self. Therefore\nevery one desires everything for himself, desires to possess, or at least\nto control, everything, and whatever opposes it it would like to destroy.\nTo this is added, in the case of such beings as have knowledge, that the\nindividual is the supporter of the knowing subject, and the knowing\nsubject is the supporter of the world, _i.e._, that the whole of Nature\noutside the knowing subject, and thus also all other individuals, exist\nonly in its idea; it is only conscious of them as its idea, thus merely\nindirectly as something which is dependent on its own nature and\nexistence; for with its consciousness the world necessarily disappears for\nit, _i.e._, its being and non-being become synonymous and\nindistinguishable. Every knowing individual is thus in truth, and finds\nitself as the whole will to live, or the inner being of the world itself,\nand also as the complemental condition of the world as idea, consequently\nas a microcosm which is of equal value with the macrocosm. Nature itself,\nwhich is everywhere and always truthful, gives him this knowledge,\noriginally and independently of all reflection, with simple and direct\ncertainty. Now from these two necessary properties we have given the fact\nmay be explained that every individual, though vanishing altogether and\ndiminished to nothing in the boundless world, yet makes itself the centre\nof the world, has regard for its own existence and well-being before\neverything else; indeed, from the natural standpoint, is ready to\nsacrifice everything else for this—is ready to annihilate the world in\norder to maintain its own self, this drop in the ocean, a little longer.\nThis disposition is _egoism_, which is essential to everything in Nature.\nYet it is just through egoism that the inner conflict of the will with\nitself attains to such a terrible revelation; for this egoism has its\ncontinuance and being in that opposition of the microcosm and macrocosm,\nor in the fact that the objectification of will has the _principium\nindividuationis_ for its form, through which the will manifests itself in\nthe same way in innumerable individuals, and indeed entire and completely\nin both aspects (will and idea) in each. Thus, while each individual is\ngiven to itself directly as the whole will and the whole subject of ideas,\nother individuals are only given it as ideas. Therefore its own being, and\nthe maintenance of it, is of more importance to it than that of all others\ntogether. Every one looks upon his own death as upon the end of the world,\nwhile he accepts the death of his acquaintances as a matter of comparative\nindifference, if he is not in some way affected by it. In the\nconsciousness that has reached the highest grade, that of man, egoism, as\nwell as knowledge, pain and pleasure, must have reached its highest grade\nalso, and the conflict of individuals which is conditioned by it must\nappear in its most terrible form. And indeed we see this everywhere before\nour eyes, in small things as in great. Now we see its terrible side in the\nlives of great tyrants and miscreants, and in world-desolating wars; now\nits absurd side, in which it is the theme of comedy, and very specially\nappears as self-conceit and vanity. Rochefoucault understood this better\nthan any one else, and presented it in the abstract. We see it both in the\nhistory of the world and in our own experience. But it appears most\ndistinctly of all when any mob of men is set free from all law and order;\nthen there shows itself at once in the distinctest form the _bellum omnium\ncontra omnes_, which Hobbes has so admirably described in the first\nchapter _De Cive_. We see not only how every one tries to seize from the\nother what he wants himself, but how often one will destroy the whole\nhappiness or life of another for the sake of an insignificant addition to\nhis own happiness. This is the highest expression of egoism, the\nmanifestations of which in this regard are only surpassed by those of\nactual wickedness, which seeks, quite disinterestedly, the hurt and\nsuffering of others, without any advantage to itself. Of this we shall\nspeak soon. With this exhibition of the source of egoism the reader should\ncompare the presentation of it in my prize-essay on the basis of morals, §\n14.\n\nA chief source of that suffering which we found above to be essential and\ninevitable to all life is, when it really appears in a definite form, that\n_Eris_, the conflict of all individuals, the expression of the\ncontradiction, with which the will to live is affected in its inner self,\nand which attains a visible form through the _principium individuationis_.\nWild-beast fights are the most cruel means of showing this directly and\nvividly. In this original discord lies an unquenchable source of\nsuffering, in spite of the precautions that have been taken against it,\nand which we shall now consider more closely.",

    "page_content": "of the will to live is only the assertion of one’s own body, _i.e._, the\nexhibition of the will through acts in time, so far as the body, in its\nform and design, exhibits the same will in space, and no further. This\nassertion shows itself as maintenance of the body, by means of the\napplication of its own powers. To it is directly related the satisfaction\nof the sexual impulse; indeed this belongs to it, because the genitals\nbelong to the body. Therefore _voluntary_ renunciation of the satisfaction\nof that impulse, based upon no _motive_, is already a denial of the will\nto live, is a voluntary self-suppression of it, upon the entrance of\nknowledge which acts as a _quieter_. Accordingly such denial of one’s own\nbody exhibits itself as a contradiction by the will of its own phenomenon.\nFor although here also the body objectifies in the genitals the will to\nperpetuate the species, yet this is not willed. Just on this account,\nbecause it is a denial or suppression of the will to live, such a\nrenunciation is a hard and painful self-conquest; but of this later. But\nsince the will exhibits that _self-assertion_ of one’s own body in\ninnumerable individuals beside each other, it very easily extends in one\nindividual, on account of the egoism peculiar to them all, beyond this\nassertion to the _denial_ of the same will appearing in another\nindividual. The will of the first breaks through the limits of the\nassertion of will of another, because the individual either destroys or\ninjures this other body itself, or else because it compels the powers of\nthe other body to serve _its own_ will, instead of the will which\nmanifests itself in that other body. Thus if, from the will manifesting\nitself as another body, it withdraws the powers of this body, and so\nincreases the power serving its own will beyond that of its own body, it\nconsequently asserts its own will beyond its own body by means of the\nnegation of the will appearing in another body. This breaking through the\nlimits of the assertion of will of another has always been distinctly\nrecognised, and its concept denoted by the word _wrong_. For both sides\nrecognise the fact instantly, not, indeed, as we do here in distinct\nabstraction, but as feeling. He who suffers wrong feels the transgression\ninto the sphere of the assertion of his own body, through the denial of it\nby another individual, as a direct and mental pain which is entirely\nseparated and different from the accompanying physical suffering\nexperienced from the act or the vexation at the loss. To the doer of\nwrong, on the other hand, the knowledge presents itself that he is in\nhimself the same will which appears in that body also, and which asserts\nitself with such vehemence; the one phenomenon that, transgressing the\nlimits of its own body and its powers, it extends to the denial of this\nvery will in another phenomenon, and so, regarded as will in itself, it\nstrives against itself by this vehemence and rends itself. Moreover, this\nknowledge presents itself to him instantly, not _in abstracto_, but as an\nobscure feeling; and this is called remorse, or, more accurately in this\ncase, the feeling of _wrong committed_.\n\n_Wrong_, the conception of which we have thus analysed in its most general\nand abstract form, expresses itself in the concrete most completely,\npeculiarly, and palpably in cannibalism. This is its most distinct and\nevident type, the terrible picture of the greatest conflict of the will\nwith itself at the highest grade of its objectification, which is man.\nNext to this, it expresses itself most distinctly in murder; and therefore\nthe committal of murder is followed instantly and with fearful\ndistinctness by remorse, the abstract and dry significance of which we\nhave just given, which inflicts a wound on our peace of mind that a\nlifetime cannot heal. For our horror at the murder committed, as also our\nshrinking from the committal of it, corresponds to that infinite clinging\nto life with which everything living, as phenomenon of the will to live,\nis penetrated. (We shall analyse this feeling which accompanies the doing\nof wrong and evil, in other words, the pangs of conscience, more fully\nlater on, and raise its concept to distinctness.) Mutilation, or mere\ninjury of another body, indeed every blow, is to be regarded as in its\nnature the same as murder, and differing from it only in degree. Further,\nwrong shows itself in the subjugation of another individual, in forcing\nhim into slavery, and, finally, in the seizure of another’s goods, which,\nso far as these goods are regarded as the fruit of his labour, is just the\nsame thing as making him a slave, and is related to this as mere injury is\nto murder.\n\nFor _property_, which is not taken from a man without _wrong_, can,\naccording to our explanation of wrong, only be that which has been\nproduced by his own powers. Therefore by taking this we really take the\npowers of his body from the will objectified in it, to make them subject\nto the will objectified in another body. For only so does the wrong-doer,\nby seizing, not the body of another, but a lifeless thing quite different\nfrom it, break into the sphere of the assertion of will of another person,\nbecause the powers, the work of this other body, are, as it were,\nincorporated and identified with this thing. It follows from this that all\ntrue, _i.e._, moral, right of property is based simply and solely on work,\nas was pretty generally assumed before Kant, and is distinctly and\nbeautifully expressed in the oldest of all codes of law: “Wise men who\nknow the past explain that a cultured field is the property of him who cut\ndown the wood and cleared and ploughed it, as an antelope belongs to the\nfirst hunter who mortally wounds it” (Laws of Manu, ix. 44). Kant’s\nphilosophy of law is an extraordinary concatenation of errors all leading\nto each other, and he bases the right of property upon first occupation.\nTo me this is only explicable on the supposition that his powers were\nfailing through old age. For how should the mere avowal of my will to\nexclude others from the use of a thing at once give me a _right_ to it?\nClearly such an avowal itself requires a foundation of right, instead of\nbeing one, as Kant assumes. And how would he act unjustly _in se_, _i.e._,\nmorally, who does not respect that claim to the sole possession of a thing\nwhich is based upon nothing but its own avowal? How should his conscience\ntrouble him about it? For it is so clear and easy to understand that there\ncan be absolutely no such thing as a just seizure of anything, but only a\njust conversion or acquired possession of it, by spending our own original\npowers upon it. When, by any foreign labour, however little, a thing has\nbeen cultivated, improved, kept from harm or preserved, even if this\nlabour were only the plucking or picking up from the ground of fruit that\nhas grown wild; the person who forcibly seizes such a thing clearly\ndeprives the other of the result of his labour expended upon it, makes the\nbody of this other serve his will instead of its own, asserts his will\nbeyond its own phenomenon to the denial of that of the other, _i.e._, does\ninjustice or wrong.(74) On the other hand, the mere enjoyment of a thing,\nwithout any cultivation or preservation of it from destruction, gives just\nas little right to it as the mere avowal of our desire for its sole\npossession. Therefore, though one family has hunted a district alone, even\nfor a hundred years, but has done nothing for its improvement; if a\nstranger comes and desires to hunt there, it cannot prevent him from doing\nso without moral injustice. Thus the so-called right of preoccupation,\naccording to which, for the mere past enjoyment of a thing, there is\ndemanded the further recompense of the exclusive right to its future\nenjoyment, is morally entirely without foundation. A new-comer might with\nfar better right reply to him who was depending upon such a right, “Just\nbecause you have so long enjoyed, it is right that others should now enjoy\nalso.” No moral right can be established to the sole possession of\nanything upon which labour cannot be expended, either in improving it or\nin preserving it from harm, unless it be through a voluntary surrender on\nthe part of others, as a reward for other services. This, however, already\npresupposes a community regulated by agreement—the State. The morally\nestablished right of property, as we have deduced it above, gives, from\nits nature, to the owner of a thing, the same unlimited power over it\nwhich he has over his own body; and hence it follows that he can part with\nhis possessions to others either in exchange or as a gift, and they then\npossess them with the same moral right as he did.\n\nAs regards the doing of wrong generally, it occurs either through violence\nor through craft; it matters not which as far as what is morally essential\nis concerned. First, in the case of murder, it is a matter of indifference\nwhether I make use of a dagger or of poison; and the case of every bodily\ninjury is analogous. Other cases of wrong can all be reduced to the fact\nthat I, as the doer of wrong, compel another individual to serve my will\ninstead of his own, to act according to my will instead of according to\nhis own. On the path of violence I attain this end through physical\ncausality, but on the path of craft by means of motivation, _i.e._, by\nmeans of causality through knowledge; for I present to his will illusive\nmotives, on account of which he follows my will, while he believes he is\nfollowing his own. Since the medium in which the motives lie is knowledge,\nI can only accomplish this by falsifying his knowledge, and this is the\n_lie_. The lie always aims at influencing another’s will, not merely his\nknowledge, for itself and as such, but only as a means, so far as it\ndetermines his will. For my lying itself, inasmuch as it proceeds from my\nwill, requires a motive; and only the will of another can be such a\nmotive, not his knowledge in and for itself; for as such it can never have\nan influence upon _my_ will, therefore it can never move it, can never be\na motive of its aim. But only the willing and doing of another can be\nthis, and his knowledge indirectly through it. This holds good not only of\nall lies that have manifestly sprung from self-interest, but also of those\nwhich proceed from pure wickedness, which seeks enjoyment in the painful\nconsequences of the error into which it has led another. Indeed, mere\nempty boasting aims at influencing the will and action of others more or\nless, by increasing their respect or improving their opinion of the\nboaster. The mere refusal of a truth, _i.e._, of an assertion generally,\nis in itself no wrong, but every imposing of a lie is certainly a wrong.\nHe who refuses to show the strayed traveller the right road does him no\nwrong, but he who directs him to a false road certainly does. It follows\nfrom what has been said, that every _lie_, like every act of violence, is\nas such _wrong_, because as such it has for its aim the extension of the\nauthority of my will to other individuals, and so the assertion of my will\nthrough the denial of theirs, just as much as violence has. But the most\ncomplete lie is the _broken contract_, because here all the conditions\nmentioned are completely and distinctly present together. For when I enter\ninto a contract, the promised performance of the other individual is\ndirectly and confessedly the motive for my reciprocal performance. The\npromises were deliberately and formally exchanged. The fulfilment of the\ndeclarations made is, it is assumed, in the power of each. If the other\nbreaks the covenant, he has deceived me, and by introducing merely\nillusory motives into my knowledge, he has bent my will according to his\nintention; he has extended the control of his will to another individual,\nand thus has committed a distinct wrong. On this is founded the moral\nlawfulness and validity of the _contract_.\n\nWrong through violence is not so _shameful_ to the doer of it as wrong\nthrough craft; for the former arises from physical power, which under all\ncircumstances impresses mankind; while the latter, by the use of\nsubterfuge, betrays weakness, and lowers man at once as a physical and\nmoral being. This is further the case because lying and deception can only\nsucceed if he who employs them expresses at the same time horror and\ncontempt of them in order to win confidence, and his victory rests on the\nfact that men credit him with honesty which he does not possess. The deep\nhorror which is always excited by cunning, faithlessness, and treachery\nrests on the fact that good faith and honesty are the bond which\nexternally binds into a unity the will which has been broken up into the\nmultiplicity of individuals, and thereby limits the consequences of the\negoism which results from that dispersion. Faithlessness and treachery\nbreak this outward bond asunder, and thus give boundless scope to the\nconsequences of egoism.\n\nIn the connection of our system we have found that the content of the\nconcept of _wrong_ is that quality of the conduct of an individual in\nwhich he extends the assertion of the will appearing in his own body so\nfar that it becomes the denial of the will appearing in the bodies of\nothers. We have also laid down, by means of very general examples, the\nlimits at which the province of wrong begins; for we have at once defined\nits gradations, from the highest degree to the lowest, by means of a few\nleading conceptions. According to this, the concept of wrong is the\noriginal and positive, and the concept of right, which is opposed to it,\nis the derivative and negative; for we must keep to the concepts, and not\nto the words. As a matter of fact, there would be no talk of right if\nthere were no such thing as wrong. The concept right contains merely the\nnegation of wrong, and every action is subsumed under it which does not\ntransgress the limit laid down above, _i.e._, is not a denial of the will\nof another for the stronger assertion of our own. That limit, therefore,\ndivides, as regards a purely _moral_ definition, the whole province of\npossible actions into such as are wrong or right. Whenever an action does\nnot encroach, in the way explained above, on the sphere of the assertion\nof will of another, denying it, it is not wrong. Therefore, for example,\nthe refusal of help to another in great need, the quiet contemplation of\nthe death of another from starvation while we ourselves have more than\nenough, is certainly cruel and fiendish, but it is not wrong; only it can\nbe affirmed with certainty that whoever is capable of carrying unkindness\nand hardness to such a degree will certainly also commit every wrong\nwhenever his wishes demand it and no compulsion prevents it.\n\nBut the conception of right as the negation of wrong finds its principal\napplication, and no doubt its origin, in cases in which an attempted wrong\nby violence is warded off. This warding off cannot itself be wrong, and\nconsequently is right, although the violence it requires, regarded in\nitself and in isolation, would be wrong, and is here only justified by the\nmotive, _i.e._, becomes right. If an individual goes so far in the\nassertion of his own will that he encroaches upon the assertion of will\nwhich is essential to my person as such, and denies it, then my warding\noff of that encroachment is only the denial of that denial, and thus from\nmy side is nothing more than the assertion of the will which essentially\nand originally appears in my body, and is already implicitly expressed by\nthe mere appearance of this body; consequently is not wrong, but right.\nThat is to say: I have then a right to deny that denial of another with\nthe force necessary to overcome it, and it is easy to see that this may\nextend to the killing of the other individual, whose encroachment as\nexternal violence pressing upon me may be warded off by a somewhat\nstronger counteraction, entirely without wrong, consequently with right.\nFor all that happens from my side lies always within the sphere of the\nassertion of will essential to my person as such, and already expressed by\nit (which is the scene of the conflict), and does not encroach on that of\nthe other, consequently is only negation of the negation, and thus\naffirmation, not itself negation. Thus if the will of another denies my\nwill, as this appears in my body and the use of its powers for its\nmaintenance, without denial of any foreign will which observes a like\nlimitation, I can _without wrong_ compel it to desist from such denial,\n_i.e._, I have so far a _right of compulsion_.\n\nIn all cases in which I have a right of compulsion, a complete right to\nuse _violence_ against another, I may, according to the circumstances,\njust as well oppose the violence of the other with _craft_ without doing\nany wrong, and accordingly I have an actual _right to lie precisely so far\nas I have a right of compulsion_. Therefore a man acts with perfect right\nwho assures a highway robber who is searching him that he has nothing more\nupon him; or, if a burglar has broken into his house by night, induces him\nby a lie to enter a cellar and then locks him in. A man who has been\ncaptured and carried off by robbers, for example by pirates, has the right\nto kill them not only by violence but also by craft, in order to regain\nhis freedom. Thus, also, a promise is certainly not binding when it has\nbeen extorted by direct bodily violence, because he who suffers such\ncompulsion may with full right free himself by killing, and, _a fortiori_,\nby deceiving his oppressor. Whoever cannot recover through force the\nproperty which has been stolen from him, commits no wrong if he can\naccomplish it through craft. Indeed, if some one plays with me for money\nhe has stolen from me, I have the right to use false dice against him,\nbecause all that I win from him already belongs to me. Whoever would deny\nthis must still more deny the justifiableness of stratagem in war, which\nis just an acted lie, and is a proof of the saying of Queen Christina of\nSweden, “The words of men are to be esteemed as nothing; scarcely are\ntheir deeds to be trusted.” So sharply does the limit of right border upon\nthat of wrong. For the rest, I regard it as superfluous to show that all\nthis completely agrees with what was said above about the unlawfulness of\nthe lie and of violence. It may also serve to explain the peculiar theory\nof the lie told under pressure.(75)\n\nIn accordance with what has been said, wrong and right are merely moral\ndeterminations, _i.e._, such as are valid with regard to the consideration\nof human action as such, and in relation _to the inner significance of\nthis action in itself_. This asserts itself directly in consciousness\nthrough the fact that the doing of wrong is accompanied by an inward pain,\nwhich is the merely felt consciousness of the wrong-doer of the excessive\nstrength of the assertion of will in itself, which extends even to the\ndenial of the manifestation of the will of another, and also the\nconsciousness that although he is different from the person suffering\nwrong as far as the manifestation is concerned, yet in himself he is\nidentical with him. The further explanation of this inner significance of\nall pain of conscience cannot be given till later. He who suffers wrong\nis, on the other hand, painfully conscious of the denial of his will, as\nit is expressed through the body and its natural requirements, for the\nsatisfaction of which nature refers him to the powers of his body; and at\nthe same time he is conscious that without doing wrong he might ward off\nthat denial by every means unless he lacks the power. This purely moral\nsignificance is the only one which right and wrong have for men as men,\nnot as members of the State, and which consequently remains even when man\nis in a state of nature without any positive law. It constitutes the basis\nand the content of all that has on this account been named _natural law_,\nthough it is better called moral law, for its validity does not extend to\nsuffering, to the external reality, but only to the action of man and the\nself-knowledge of his individual will which grows up in him from his\naction, and which is called _conscience_. It cannot, however, in a state\nof nature, assert itself in all cases, and outwardly upon other\nindividuals, and prevent might from reigning instead of right. In a state\nof nature it depends upon every one merely to see that in every case he\n_does_ no wrong, but by no means to see that in every case he _suffers_ no\nwrong, for this depends on the accident of his outward power. Therefore\nthe concepts right and wrong, even in a state of nature, are certainly\nvalid and by no means conventional, but there they are valid merely as\n_moral_ concepts, for the self-knowledge of one’s own will in each. They\nare a fixed point in the scale of the very different degrees of strength\nwith which the will to live asserts itself in human individuals, like the\nfreezing-point on the thermometer; the point at which the assertion of\none’s own will becomes the denial of the will of another, _i.e._,\nspecifies through wrong-doing the degree of its intensity, combined with\nthe degree in which knowledge is involved in the _principium\nindividuationis_ (which is the form of all knowledge that is subject to\nthe will). But whoever wants to set aside the purely moral consideration\nof human action, or denies it, and wishes to regard conduct merely in its\noutward effects and their consequences, may certainly, with Hobbes,\nexplain right and wrong as conventional definitions arbitrarily assumed,\nand therefore not existing outside positive law, and we can never show him\nthrough external experience what does not belong to such experience.\nHobbes himself characterises his completely empirical method of thought\nvery remarkably by the fact that in his book “_De Principiis Geometrarum_”\nhe denies all pure mathematics properly so called, and obstinately\nmaintains that the point has extension and the line has breadth, and we\ncan never show him a point without extension or a line without breadth.\nThus we can just as little impart to him the _a priori_ nature of\nmathematics as the _a priori_ nature of right, because he shuts himself\nout from all knowledge which is not empirical.\n\nThe pure doctrine of right is thus a chapter of ethics, and is directly\nrelated only to _action_, not to _suffering_; for only the former is the\nexpression of will, and this alone is considered by ethics. Suffering is\nmere occurrence. Ethics can only have regard to suffering indirectly,\nmerely to show that what takes place merely to avoid suffering wrong is\nitself no infliction of wrong. The working out of this chapter of ethics\nwould contain the precise definition of the limits to which an individual\nmay go in the assertion of the will already objectified in his body\nwithout denying the same will as it appears in another individual; and\nalso the actions which transgress these limits, which consequently are\nwrong, and therefore in their turn may be warded off without wrong. Thus\nour own _action_ always remains the point of view of the investigation.\n\nBut the _suffering of wrong_ appears as an event in outward experience,\nand in it is manifested, as we have said, more distinctly than anywhere\nelse, the phenomenon of the conflict of the will to live with itself,\narising from the multiplicity of individuals and from egoism, both of\nwhich are conditioned through the _principium individuationis_, which is\nthe form of the world as idea for the knowledge of the individual. We also\nsaw above that a very large part of the suffering essential to human life\nhas its perennial source in that conflict of individuals.\n\nThe reason, however, which is common to all these individuals, and which\nenables them to know not merely the particular case, as the brutes do, but\nalso the whole abstractly in its connection, has also taught them to\ndiscern the source of that suffering, and induced them to consider the\nmeans of diminishing it, or, when possible, of suppressing it by a common\nsacrifice, which is, however, more than counterbalanced by the common\nadvantage that proceeds from it. However agreeable it is to the egoism of\nthe individual to inflict wrong in particular cases, this has yet a\nnecessary correlative in the suffering of wrong of another individual, to\nwhom it is a great pain. And because the reason which surveys the whole\nleft the one-sided point of view of the individual to which it belongs,\nand freed itself for the moment from its dependence upon it, it saw the\npleasure of an individual in inflicting wrong always outweighed by the\nrelatively greater pain of the other who suffered the wrong; and it found\nfurther, that because here everything was left to chance, every one had to\nfear that the pleasure of conveniently inflicting wrong would far more\nrarely fall to his lot than the pain of enduring it. From this reason\nrecognised that both in order to diminish the suffering which is\neverywhere disseminated, and as far as possible to divide it equally, the\nbest and only means was to spare all the pain of suffering wrong by\nrenouncing all the pleasure to be obtained by inflicting it. This means is\nthe _contract of the state_ or _law_. It is easily conceived, and little\nby little carried out by the egoism, which, through the use of reason,\nproceeds methodically and forsakes its one-sided point of view. This\norigin of the state and of law I have indicated was already exhibited as\nsuch by Plato in the “Republic.” In fact, it is the essential and only\norigin, determined by the nature of the matter. Moreover, in no land can\nthe state have ever had a different origin, because it is just this mode\nof originating this aim that makes it a state. But it is a matter of\nindifference whether, in each particular nation, the condition which\npreceded it was that of a horde of savages independent of each other\n(anarchy), or that of a horde of slaves ruled at will by the stronger\n(despotism). In both cases there existed as yet no state; it first arose\nthrough that common agreement; and according as that agreement is more or\nless free from anarchy or despotism, the state is more or less perfect.\nRepublics tend to anarchy, monarchies to despotism, and the mean of\nconstitutional monarchy, which was therefore devised, tends to government\nby factions. In order to found a perfect state, we must begin by providing\nbeings whose nature allows them always to sacrifice their own to the\npublic good. Till then, however, something may be attained through the\nexistence of _one_ family whose good is quite inseparable from that of the\ncountry; so that, at least in matters of importance, it can never advance\nthe one without the other. On this rests the power and the advantage of\nthe hereditary monarchy.\n\nNow as ethics was concerned exclusively with right and wrong doing, and\ncould accurately point out the limits of his action to whoever was\nresolved to do no wrong; politics, on the contrary, the theory of\nlegislation, is exclusively concerned with the _suffering_ of wrong, and\nwould never trouble itself with wrong-doing at all if it were not on\naccount of its ever-necessary correlative, the suffering of wrong, which\nit always keeps in view as the enemy it opposes. Indeed, if it were\npossible to conceive an infliction of wrong with which no suffering of\nwrong on the part of another was connected, the state would, consistently,\nby no means prohibit it. And because in ethics the will, the disposition,\nis the object of consideration, and the only real thing, the firm will to\ndo wrong, which is only restrained and rendered ineffective by external\nmight, and the actually committed wrong, are to it quite the same, and it\ncondemns him who so wills as unjust at its tribunal. On the other hand,\nwill and disposition, merely as such, do not concern the state at all, but\nonly the _deed_ (whether it is merely attempted or carried out), on\naccount of its correlative, the _suffering_ on the part of another. Thus\nfor the state the deed, the event, is the only real; the disposition, the\nintention, is only investigated so far as the significance of the deed\nbecomes known through it. Therefore the state will forbid no one to carry\nabout in his thought murder and poison against another, so long as it\nknows certainly that the fear of the sword and the wheel will always\nrestrain the effects of that will. The state has also by no means to\neradicate the foolish purpose, the inclination to wrong-doing, the wicked\ndisposition; but merely always to place beside every possible motive for\ndoing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone in the\ninevitable punishment that will ensue. Therefore the criminal code is as\ncomplete a register as possible of motives against every criminal action\nthat can possibly be imagined—both _in abstracto_, in order to make any\ncase that occurs an application _in concreto_. Politics or legislation\nwill therefore for this end borrow from that chapter of ethics which is\nthe doctrine of right, and which, besides the inner significance of right\nand wrong, determines the exact limits between them. Yet it will only do\nso for the purpose of making use of its reverse side, and regarding all\nthe limits which ethics lays down as not to be transgressed, if we are to\navoid _doing_ wrong, from the other side, as the limits which we must not\nallow others to transgress if we do not wish to _suffer_ wrong, and from\nwhich we have therefore a _right_ to drive others back. Therefore these\nlimits are, as much as possible, from the passive side, barricaded by\nlaws. It is evident that as an historian has very wittily been called an\ninverted prophet, the professor of law is an inverted moralist, and\ntherefore law itself, in its proper sense, _i.e._, the doctrine of the\n_right_, which we ought to maintain, is inverted ethics in that chapter of\nit in which the rights are laid down which we ought not to violate. The\nconcept of wrong and its negation, that of right, which is originally\n_ethical_, becomes _juridical_ by the transference of the starting-point\nfrom the active to the passive side, and thus by inversion. This, as well\nas Kant’s theory of law, which very falsely deduces the institution of the\nstate as a moral duty from his categorical imperative, has, even in the\nmost recent times, repeatedly occasioned the very extraordinary error that\nthe state is an institution for furthering morality; that it arises from\nthe endeavour after this, and is, consequently, directed against egoism.\nAs if the inward disposition, to which alone morality or immorality\nbelongs, the externally free will, would allow itself to be modified from\nwithout and changed by influences exerted upon it! Still more perverse is\nthe theory that the state is the condition of freedom in the moral sense,\nand in this way the condition of morality; for freedom lies beyond the\nphenomenon, and indeed beyond human arrangements. The state is, as we have\nsaid, so little directed against egoism in general and as such, that, on\nthe contrary, it has sprung from egoism and exists only in its service—an\negoism that well understands itself, proceeds methodically and forsakes\nthe one-sided for the universal point of view, and so by addition is the\ncommon egoism of all. The state is thus instituted under the correct\npresupposition that pure morality, _i.e._, right action from moral\ngrounds, is not to be expected; if this were not the case, it would itself\nbe superfluous. Thus the state, which aims at well-being, is by no means\ndirected against egoism, but only against the disadvantageous consequences\nwhich arise from the multiplicity of egoistic individuals, and\nreciprocally affect them all and disturb their well-being. Therefore it\nwas already said by Aristotle (De. Rep. iii.): Τελος μεν ουν πολεως το ευ\nζην; τουτο δε εστιν το ζῃν ευδαιμονως και καλως (_Finis civitatis est bene\nvivere, hoc autem est beate et pulchre vivere_). Hobbes also has\naccurately and excellently expounded this origin and end of the state; and\nthat old first principle of all state policy, _salus publica prima lex\nesto_, indicates the same thing. If the state completely attains its end,\nit will produce the same outward result as if perfect justice of\ndisposition prevailed everywhere. But the inner nature and origin of both\nphenomena will be the converse. Thus in the second case it would be that\nno one wished to _do_ wrong, and in the first that no one wished to\n_suffer_ wrong, and the means appropriate to this end had been fully\nemployed. Thus the same line may be drawn from opposite directions, and a\nbeast of prey with a muzzle is as harmless as a graminivorous animal. But\nbeyond this point the state cannot go. It cannot exhibit a phenomenon such\nas would spring from universal mutual well-wishing and love. For just as\nwe found that from its nature it would not forbid the doing of a wrong\nwhich involved no corresponding suffering of wrong on the part of another,\nand prohibits all wrong-doing only because this is impossible; so\nconversely, in accordance with its tendency towards the well-being of all,\nit would very gladly take care that every benevolent action and work of\nhuman love should be _experienced_, if it were not that these also have an\ninevitable correlative in the _performance_ of acts of benevolence and\nworks of love, and every member of the state would wish to assume the\npassive and none the active rôle, and there would be no reason for\nexacting the latter from one member of the state rather than from another.\nAccordingly only the negative, which is just the _right_, not the\npositive, which has been comprehended under the name of obligations of\nlove, or, less completely, duties, _can be exacted by force_.\n\nLegislation, as we have said, borrows the pure philosophy of right, or the\ndoctrine of the nature and limits of right and wrong, from ethics, in\norder to apply it from the reverse side to its own ends, which are\ndifferent from those of ethics, and to institute positive legislation and\nthe means of supporting it, _i.e._, the state, in accordance with it.\nPositive legislation is thus the inverted application of the purely moral\ndoctrine of right. This application may be made with reference to the\npeculiar relations and circumstances of a particular people. But only if\nthe positive legislation is, in essential matters, throughout determined\nin accordance with the guidance of the pure theory of right, and for each\nof its propositions a ground can be established in the pure theory of\nright, is the legislation which has arisen a _positive right_ and the\nstate a community _based upon right_, a _state_ in the proper meaning of\nthe word, a morally permissible, not immoral institution. Otherwise the\npositive legislation is, on the contrary, the establishment of a _positive\nwrong_; it is itself an openly avowed enforced wrong. Such is every\ndespotism, the constitution of most Mohammedan kingdoms; and indeed\nvarious parts of many constitutions are also of this kind; for example,\nserfdom, vassalage, and many such institutions. The pure theory of right\nor natural right—better, moral right—though always reversed, lies at the\nfoundation of every just positive legislation, as pure mathematics lies at\nthe foundation of every branch of applied mathematics. The most important\npoints of the doctrine of right, as philosophy has to supply it for that\nend to legislation, are the following: 1. The explanation of the inner and\nreal significance both of the origin of the conceptions of wrong and\nright, and of their application and position in ethics. 2. The deduction\nof the law of property. 3. The deduction of the moral validity of\ncontracts; for this is the moral basis of the contract of the state. 4.\nThe explanation of the origin and the aim of the state, of the relation of\nthis aim to ethics, and of the intentional transference of the ethical\ndoctrine of right, by reversing it, to legislation, in consequence of this\nrelation. 5. The deduction of the right of punishment. The remaining\ncontent of the doctrine of right is mere application of these principles,\nmere accurate definition of the limits of right and wrong for all possible\nrelations of life, which are consequently united and distributed under\ncertain points of view and titles. In these special doctrines the books\nwhich treat of pure law are fairly at one; it is only in the principles\nthat they differ much, for these are always connected with some\nphilosophical system. In connection with our system, we have explained the\nfirst four of these principal points shortly and generally, yet definitely\nand distinctly, and it remains for us to speak in the same way of the\nright of punishment.\n\nKant makes the fundamentally false assertion that apart from the state\nthere would be no complete right of property. It follows from our\ndeduction, as given above, that even in a state of nature there is\nproperty with complete natural, _i.e._, moral right, which cannot be\ninjured without wrong, but may without wrong be defended to the uttermost.\nOn the other hand, it is certain that apart from the state there is no\nright of punishment. All right to punish is based upon the positive law\nalone, which _before_ the offence has determined a punishment for it, the\nthreat of which, as a counter-motive, is intended to outweigh all possible\nmotives for the offence. This positive law is to be regarded as sanctioned\nand recognised by all the members of the state. It is thus based upon a\ncommon contract which the members of the state are in duty bound to\nfulfil, and thus, on the one hand, to inflict the punishment, and, on the\nother hand, to endure it; thus the endurance of the punishment may with\nright be enforced. Consequently the immediate _end of punishment_ is, in\nthe particular case, _the fulfilment of the law as a contract_. But the\none end of the _law_ is _deterrence_ from the infringement of the rights\nof others. For, in order that every one may be protected from suffering\nwrong, men have combined to form a state, have renounced the doing of\nwrong, and assumed the task of maintaining the state. Thus the law and the\nfulfilment of it, the punishment, are essentially directed to the\n_future_, not to the _past_. This distinguishes _punishment_ from\n_revenge_; for the motives which instigate the latter are solely concerned\nwith what has happened, and thus with the past as such. All requital of\nwrong by the infliction of pain, without any aim for the future, is\nrevenge, and can have no other end than consolation for the suffering one\nhas borne by the sight of the suffering one has inflicted upon another.\nThis is wickedness and cruelty, and cannot be morally justified. Wrong\nwhich some one has inflicted upon me by no means entitles me to inflict\nwrong upon him. The requital of evil with evil without further intention\nis neither morally nor otherwise through any rational ground to be\njustified, and the _jus talionis_ set up as the absolute, final principle\nof the right of punishment, is meaningless. Therefore Kant’s theory of\npunishment as mere requital for requital’s sake is a completely groundless\nand perverse view. Yet it is always appearing in the writings of many\njurists, under all kinds of lofty phrases, which amount to nothing but\nempty words, as: Through the punishment the crime is expiated or\nneutralised and abolished, and many such. But no man has the right to set\nhimself up as a purely moral judge and requiter, and punish the misdeeds\nof another with pains which he inflicts upon him, and so to impose penance\nupon him for his sins. Nay, this would rather be the most presumptuous\narrogance; and therefore the Bible says, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay,\nsaith the Lord.” But man has the right to care for the safety of society;\nand this can only be done by interdicting all actions which are denoted by\nthe word “criminal,” in order to prevent them by means of counter-motives,\nwhich are the threatened punishments. And this threat can only be made\neffective by carrying it out when a case occurs in spite of it.\nAccordingly that the end of punishment, or more accurately of penal law,\nis the deterrence from crime, is a truth so generally recognised and\nindeed self-evident, that in England it is expressed in the very old form\nof indictment which is still served by the counsel for the Crown in\ncriminal actions, for it concludes with the words, “If this be proved,\nyou, the said N. N., ought to be punished with pains of law, to deter\nothers from the like crimes in all time coming.” If a prince desires to\nextend mercy to a criminal who has justly been condemned, his Ministers\nwill represent to him that, if he does, this crime will soon be repeated.\nAn end for the future distinguishes punishment from revenge, and\npunishment only has this end when it is inflicted _in fulfilment of a\nlaw_. It thus announces itself as inevitable in every future case, and\nthus the law obtains the power to deter, in which its end really consists.\nNow here a Kantian would inevitably reply that certainly according to this\nview the punished criminal would be used “merely as a means.” This\nproposition, so unweariedly repeated by all the Kantians, “Man must always\nbe treated as an end, never as a means,” certainly sounds significant, and\nis therefore a very suitable proposition for those who like to have a\nformula which saves them all further thought; but looked at in the light,\nit is an exceedingly vague, indefinite assertion, which reaches its aim\nquite indirectly, requires to be explained, defined, and modified in every\ncase of its application, and, if taken generally, is insufficient, meagre,\nand moreover problematical. The murderer who has been condemned to the\npunishment of death according to law must now, at any rate, and with\ncomplete right, be used as a mere means. For public security, the chief\nend of the state, is disturbed by him; indeed it is abolished if the law\nis not carried out. The murderer, his life, his person, must now be the\nmeans of fulfilling the law, and thereby of re-establishing the public\nsecurity. And he is made such a means with perfect right, in fulfilment of\nthe contract of the state, which was entered into by him because he was a\ncitizen, and in accordance with which, in order to enjoy security for his\nlife, freedom, and property, he has pledged his life, his freedom, and his\nproperty for the security of all, which pledge has now been forfeited.\n\nThis theory of punishment which we have established, the theory which is\ndirectly supported by sound reason, is certainly in the main no new\nthought; but it is a thought which was almost supplanted by new errors,\nand therefore it was necessary to exhibit it as distinctly as possible.\nThe same thing is in its essence contained in what Puffendorf says on the\nsubject, “_De Officio Hominis et Civis_” (Bk. ii. chap. 12). Hobbes also\nagrees with it, “Leviathan” (chaps. 15-28). In our own day Feurbach is\nwell known to have maintained it. Indeed, it occurs even in the utterances\nof the ancient philosophers. Plato expresses it clearly in the\n“Protagoras” (p. 114, edit. Bip.), also in the “Gorgias” (p. 168), and\nlastly in the eleventh book of the “Laws” (p. 165). Seneca expresses\nPlato’s opinion and the theory of all punishment in the short sentence,\n“_Nemo prudens punit, quia peccatum est; sed ne peccetur_” (De Ira, i.\n16).\n\nThus we have come to recognise in the state the means by which egoism\nendowed with reason seeks to escape from its own evil consequences which\nturn against itself, and now each promotes the well-being of all because\nhe sees that his own well-being is involved in it. If the state attained\nits end completely, then to a certain extent something approaching to an\nUtopia might finally, by the removal of all kinds of evil, be brought\nabout. For by the human powers united in it, it is able to make the rest\nof nature more and more serviceable. But as yet the state has always\nremained very far from this goal. And even if it attained to it,\ninnumerable evils essential to all life would still keep it in suffering;\nand finally, if they were all removed, ennui would at once occupy every\nplace they left. And besides, the strife of individuals is never\ncompletely abolished by the state, for it vexes in trifles when it is\nprohibited in greater things. Finally, Eris, happily expelled from within,\nturns to what is without; as the conflict of individuals, she is banished\nby the institution of the state; but she reappears from without as the war\nof nations, and now demands in bulk and at once, as an accumulated debt,\nthe bloody sacrifice which by wise precautions has been denied her in the\nparticular. And even supposing that all this were finally overcome and\nremoved, by wisdom founded on the experience of thousands of years, at the\nend the result would be the actual over-population of the whole planet,\nthe terrible evil of which only a bold imagination can now realise.(76)",

For without this reference\nall punishing and requiting would be an outrage without justification, and\nindeed merely the addition of another evil to that which has already\noccurred, without meaning or significance. But it is quite otherwise with\n_eternal justice_, which was referred to before, and which rules not the\nstate but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not\nsubject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring,\nbut infallible, fixed, and sure. The conception of requital implies that\nof time; therefore _eternal justice_ cannot be requital. Thus it cannot,\nlike temporal justice, admit of respite and delay, and require time in\norder to triumph, equalising the evil deed by the evil consequences only\nby means of time. The punishment must here be so bound up with the offence\nthat both are one.\n\n    Δοκειτε πηδᾳν τ᾽ αδικηματ᾽ εις θεους\n    Πτεροισι, κἀπειτ᾽ εν Διος δελτου πτυχαις\n    Γραφειν τιν᾽ αυτα, Ζηνα δ᾽ εισορωντα νιν\n    Θνητοις δικαζειν?

Stob. Ecl., i. c. 4.\n\n    (“Volare pennis scelera ad ætherias domus\n    Putatis, illic in Jovis tabularia\n    Scripto referri; tum Jovem lectis super\n    Sententiam proferre?—sed mortalium\n    Facinora cœli, quantaquanta est, regia\n    Nequit tenere: nec legendis Juppiter\n    Et puniendis par est. Est tamen ultio,\n    Et, si intuemur, illa nos habitat prope.”)\n\nNow that such an eternal justice really lies in the nature of the world\nwill soon become completely evident to whoever has grasped the whole of\nthe thought which we have hitherto been developing.\n\nThe world, in all the multiplicity of its parts and forms, is the\nmanifestation, the objectivity, of the one will to live. Existence itself,\nand the kind of existence, both as a collective whole and in every part,\nproceeds from the will alone. The will is free, the will is almighty. The\nwill appears in everything, just as it determines itself in itself and\noutside time. The world is only the mirror of this willing; and all\nfinitude, all suffering, all miseries, which it contains, belong to the\nexpression of that which the will wills, are as they are because the will\nso wills. Accordingly with perfect right every being supports existence in\ngeneral, and also the existence of its species and its peculiar\nindividuality, entirely as it is and in circumstances as they are, in a\nworld such as it is, swayed by chance and error, transient, ephemeral, and\nconstantly suffering; and in all that it experiences, or indeed can\nexperience, it always gets its due. For the will belongs to it; and as the\nwill is, so is the world. Only this world itself can bear the\nresponsibility of its own existence and nature—no other; for by what means\ncould another have assumed it? Do we desire to know what men, morally\nconsidered, are worth as a whole and in general, we have only to consider\ntheir fate as a whole and in general. This is want, wretchedness,\naffliction, misery, and death. Eternal justice reigns; if they were not,\nas a whole, worthless, their fate, as a whole, would not be so sad. In\nthis sense we may say, the world itself is the judgment of the world. If\nwe could lay all the misery of the world in one scale of the balance, and\nall the guilt of the world in the other, the needle would certainly point\nto the centre.\n\nCertainly, however, the world does not exhibit itself to the knowledge of\nthe individual as such, developed for the service of the will, as it\nfinally reveals itself to the inquirer as the objectivity of the one and\nonly will to live, which he himself is. But the sight of the uncultured\nindividual is clouded, as the Hindus say, by the veil of Mâyâ. He sees not\nthe thing-in-itself but the phenomenon in time and space, the _principium\nindividuationis_, and in the other forms of the principle of sufficient\nreason. And in this form of his limited knowledge he sees not the inner\nnature of things, which is one, but its phenomena as separated, disunited,\ninnumerable, very different, and indeed opposed. For to him pleasure\nappears as one thing and pain as quite another thing: one man as a\ntormentor and a murderer, another as a martyr and a victim; wickedness as\none thing and evil as another. He sees one man live in joy, abundance, and\npleasure, and even at his door another die miserably of want and cold.\nThen he asks, Where is the retribution? And he himself, in the vehement,\npressure of will which is his origin and his nature, seizes upon the\npleasures and enjoyments of life, firmly embraces them, and knows not that\nby this very act of his will he seizes and hugs all those pains and\nsorrows at the sight of which he shudders. He sees the ills and he sees\nthe wickedness in the world, but far from knowing that both of these are\nbut different sides of the manifestation of the one will to live, he\nregards them as very different, and indeed quite opposed, and often seeks\nto escape by wickedness, _i.e._, by causing the suffering of another, from\nills, from the suffering of his own individuality, for he is involved in\nthe _principium individuationis_, deluded by the veil of Mâyâ. Just as a\nsailor sits in a boat trusting to his frail barque in a stormy sea,\nunbounded in every direction, rising and falling with the howling\nmountainous waves; so in the midst of a world of sorrows the individual\nman sits quietly, supported by and trusting to the _principium\nindividuationis_, or the way in which the individual knows things as\nphenomena. The boundless world, everywhere full of suffering in the\ninfinite past, in the infinite future, is strange to him, indeed is to him\nbut a fable; his ephemeral person, his extensionless present, his\nmomentary satisfaction, this alone has reality for him; and he does all to\nmaintain this, so long as his eyes are not opened by a better knowledge.\nTill then, there lives only in the inmost depths of his consciousness a\nvery obscure presentiment that all that is after all not really so strange\nto him, but has a connection with him, from which the _principium\nindividuationis_ cannot protect him. From this presentiment arises that\nineradicable _awe_ common to all men (and indeed perhaps even to the most\nsensible of the brutes) which suddenly seizes them if by any chance they\nbecome puzzled about the _principium individuationis_, because the\nprinciple of sufficient reason in some one of its forms seems to admit of\nan exception. For example, if it seems as if some change took place\nwithout a cause, or some one who is dead appears again, or if in any other\nway the past or the future becomes present or the distant becomes near.\nThe fearful terror at anything of the kind is founded on the fact that\nthey suddenly become puzzled about the forms of knowledge of the\nphenomenon, which alone separate their own individuality from the rest of\nthe world. But even this separation lies only in the phenomenon, and not\nin the thing-in-itself; and on this rests eternal justice. In fact, all\ntemporal happiness stands, and all prudence proceeds, upon ground that is\nundermined. They defend the person from accidents and supply its\npleasures; but the person is merely phenomenon, and its difference from\nother individuals, and exemption from the sufferings which they endure,\nrests merely in the form of the phenomenon, the _principium\nindividuationis_. According to the true nature of things, every one has\nall the suffering of the world as his own, and indeed has to regard all\nmerely possible suffering as for him actual, so long as he is the fixed\nwill to live, _i.e._, asserts life with all his power. For the knowledge\nthat sees through the _principium individuationis_, a happy life in time,\nthe gift of chance or won by prudence, amid the sorrows of innumerable\nothers, is only the dream of a beggar in which he is a king, but from\nwhich he must awake and learn from experience that only a fleeting\nillusion had separated him from the suffering of his life.\n\nEternal justice withdraws itself from the vision that is involved in the\nknowledge which follows the principle of sufficient reason in the\n_principium individuationis_; such vision misses it altogether unless it\nvindicates it in some way by fictions. It sees the bad, after misdeeds and\ncruelties of every kind, live in happiness and leave the world unpunished.\nIt sees the oppressed drag out a life full of suffering to the end without\nan avenger, a requiter appearing. But that man only will grasp and\ncomprehend eternal justice who raises himself above the knowledge that\nproceeds under the guidance of the principle of sufficient reason, bound\nto the particular thing, and recognises the Ideas, sees through the\n_principium individuationis_, and becomes conscious that the forms of the\nphenomenon do not apply to the thing-in-itself. Moreover, he alone, by\nvirtue of the same knowledge, can understand the true nature of virtue, as\nit will soon disclose itself to us in connection with the present inquiry,\nalthough for the practice of virtue this knowledge in the abstract is by\nno means demanded. Thus it becomes clear to whoever has attained to the\nknowledge referred to, that because the will is the in-itself of all\nphenomena, the misery which is awarded to others and that which he\nexperiences himself, the bad and the evil, always concerns only that one\ninner being which is everywhere the same, although the phenomena in which\nthe one and the other exhibits itself exist as quite different\nindividuals, and are widely separated by time and space. He sees that the\ndifference between him who inflicts the suffering and him who must bear it\nis only the phenomenon, and does not concern the thing-in-itself, for this\nis the will living in both, which here, deceived by the knowledge which is\nbound to its service, does not recognise itself, and seeking an increased\nhappiness in _one_ of its phenomena, produces great suffering in\n_another_, and thus, in the pressure of excitement, buries its teeth in\nits own flesh, not knowing that it always injures only itself, revealing\nin this form, through the medium of individuality, the conflict with\nitself which it bears in its inner nature. The inflicter of suffering and\nthe sufferer are one. The former errs in that he believes he is not a\npartaker in the suffering; the latter, in that he believes he is not a\npartaker in the guilt. If the eyes of both were opened, the inflicter of\nsuffering would see that he lives in all that suffers pain in the wide\nworld, and which, if endowed with reason, in vain asks why it was called\ninto existence for such great suffering, its desert of which it does not\nunderstand. And the sufferer would see that all the wickedness which is or\never was committed in the world proceeds from that will which constitutes\n_his_ own nature also, appears also in _him_, and that through this\nphenomenon and its assertion he has taken upon himself all the sufferings\nwhich proceed from such a will and bears them as his due, so long as he is\nthis will. From this knowledge speaks the profound poet Calderon in “Life\na Dream”—\n\n    “Pues el delito mayor\n    Del hombre es haber nacido.”\n\n    (“For the greatest crime of man\n    Is that he ever was born.”)\n\nWhy should it not be a crime, since, according to an eternal law, death\nfollows upon it? Calderon has merely expressed in these lines the\nChristian dogma of original sin.\n\nThe living knowledge of eternal justice, of the balance that inseparably\nbinds together the _malum culpæ_ with the _malum pœnæ_, demands the\ncomplete transcending of individuality and the principle of its\npossibility. Therefore it will always remain unattainable to the majority\nof men, as will also be the case with the pure and distinct knowledge of\nthe nature of all virtue, which is akin to it, and which we are about to\nexplain. Accordingly the wise ancestors of the Hindu people have directly\nexpressed it in the Vedas, which are only allowed to the three regenerate\ncastes, or in their esoteric teaching, so far at any rate as conception\nand language comprehend it, and their method of exposition, which always\nremains pictorial and even rhapsodical, admits; but in the religion of the\npeople, or exoteric teaching, they only communicate it by means of myths.\nThe direct exposition we find in the Vedas, the fruit of the highest human\nknowledge and wisdom, the kernel of which has at last reached us in the\nUpanishads as the greatest gift of this century. It is expressed in\nvarious ways, but especially by making all the beings in the world, living\nand lifeless, pass successively before the view of the student, and\npronouncing over every one of them that word which has become a formula,\nand as such has been called the Mahavakya: Tatoumes,—more correctly, Tat\ntwam asi,—which means, “This thou art.”(77) But for the people, that great\ntruth, so far as in their limited condition they could comprehend it, was\ntranslated into the form of knowledge which follows the principle of\nsufficient reason. This form of knowledge is indeed, from its nature,\nquite incapable of apprehending that truth pure and in itself, and even\nstands in contradiction to it, yet in the form of a myth it received a\nsubstitute for it which was sufficient as a guide for conduct. For the\nmyth enables the method of knowledge, in accordance with the principle of\nsufficient reason, to comprehend by figurative representation the ethical\nsignificance of conduct, which itself is ever foreign to it. This is the\naim of all systems of religion, for as a whole they are the mythical\nclothing of the truth which is unattainable to the uncultured human\nintellect. In this sense this myth might, in Kant’s language, be called a\npostulate of the practical reason; but regarded as such, it has the great\nadvantage that it contains absolutely no elements but such as lie before\nour eyes in the course of actual experience, and can therefore support all\nits conceptions with perceptions. What is here referred to is the myth of\nthe transmigration of souls. It teaches that all sufferings which in life\none inflicts upon other beings must be expiated in a subsequent life in\nthis world, through precisely the same sufferings; and this extends so\nfar, that he who only kills a brute must, some time in endless time, be\nborn as the same kind of brute and suffer the same death. It teaches that\nwicked conduct involves a future life in this world in suffering and\ndespised creatures, and, accordingly, that one will then be born again in\nlower castes, or as a woman, or as a brute, as Pariah or Tschandala, as a\nleper, or as a crocodile, and so forth. All the pains which the myth\nthreatens it supports with perceptions from actual life, through suffering\ncreatures which do not know how they have merited their misery, and it\ndoes not require to call in the assistance of any other hell. As a reward,\non the other hand, it promises re-birth in better, nobler forms, as\nBrahmans, wise men, or saints. The highest reward, which awaits the\nnoblest deeds and the completest resignation, which is also given to the\nwoman who in seven successive lives has voluntarily died on the funeral\npile of her husband, and not less to the man whose pure mouth has never\nuttered a single lie,—this reward the myth can only express negatively in\nthe language of this world by the promise, which is so often repeated,\nthat they shall never be born again, _Non adsumes iterum existentiam\napparentem_; or, as the Buddhists, who recognise neither Vedas nor castes,\nexpress it, “Thou shalt attain to Nirvâna,” _i.e._, to a state in which\nfour things no longer exist—birth, age, sickness, and death.\n\nNever has a myth entered, and never will one enter, more closely into the\nphilosophical truth which is attainable to so few than this primitive\ndoctrine of the noblest and most ancient nation. Broken up as this nation\nnow is into many parts, this myth yet reigns as the universal belief of\nthe people, and has the most decided influence upon life to-day, as four\nthousand years ago. Therefore Pythagoras and Plato have seized with\nadmiration on that _ne plus ultra_ of mythical representation, received it\nfrom India or Egypt, honoured it, made use of it, and, we know not how\nfar, even believed it. We, on the contrary, now send the Brahmans English\nclergymen and evangelical linen-weavers to set them right out of sympathy,\nand to show them that they are created out of nothing, and ought\nthankfully to rejoice in the fact. But it is just the same as if we fired\na bullet against a cliff. In India our religions will never take root. The\nancient wisdom of the human race will not be displaced by what happened in\nGalilee. On the contrary, Indian philosophy streams back to Europe, and\nwill produce a fundamental change in our knowledge and thought.",

    "page_content": "philosophical, we will now proceed to the kindred investigation of the\nethical significance of conduct and of conscience, which is the merely\nfelt knowledge of that significance. But first I wish at this point to\ndraw attention to two peculiarities of human nature, that might help to\nmake clear how the nature of that eternal justice, and the unity and\nidentity of the will in all its phenomena upon which it rests, is known to\nevery one, at least as an obscure feeling.\n\nWhen a bad deed has been done, it affords satisfaction not only to the\nsufferer, who for the most part feels the desire of revenge, but also to\nthe perfectly indifferent spectator, to see that he who caused another\npain suffers himself a like measure of pain; and this quite independently\nof the end which we have shown the state has in view in punishment, and\nwhich is the foundation of penal law. It seems to me that what expresses\nitself here is nothing but the consciousness of that eternal justice,\nwhich is, nevertheless, at once misunderstood and falsified by the\nunenlightened mind, for, involved in the _principium individuationis_, it\nproduces an amphiboly of the concepts and demands from the phenomenon what\nonly belongs to the thing in itself. It does not see how far in themselves\nthe offender and the offended are one, and that it is the same being\nwhich, not recognising itself in its own manifestation, bears both the\npain and the guilt, but it desires rather to see the pain also in the\nparticular individual to whom the guilt belongs. Therefore, most persons\nwould demand that a man who had a very high degree of wickedness which\nmight yet occur in many others, only not matched with other qualities such\nas are found in him, a man who also far surpassed others by extraordinary\nintellectual powers, and who inflicted unspeakable sufferings upon\nmillions of others—for example, as a conqueror,—most persons, I say, would\ndemand that such a man should at some time and in some place expiate all\nthese sufferings by a like amount of pain; for they do not recognise how\nin themselves the inflicter of suffering and the sufferers are one, and\nthat it is the same will through which the latter exist and live which\nalso appears in the former, and just through him attains to a distinct\nrevelation of its nature, and which likewise suffers both in the oppressed\nand the oppressor; and indeed in the latter in a greater measure, as the\nconsciousness has attained a higher degree of clearness and distinctness\nand the will has greater vehemence. But that the deeper knowledge, which\nis no longer involved in the _principium individuationis_, from which all\nvirtue and nobleness proceed, no longer retains the disposition which\ndemands requital, is shown by the Christian ethics, which absolutely\nforbids all requital of evil with evil, and allows eternal justice to\nproceed in the sphere of the thing-in-itself, which is different from that\nof the phenomenon. (“Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the\nLord,”—Rom. xii. 19.)\n\nA much more striking, but also a much rarer, characteristic of human\nnature, which expresses that desire to draw eternal justice into the\nprovince of experience, _i.e._, of individuality, and at the same time\nindicates a felt consciousness that, as I have expressed it above, the\nwill to live conducts at its own cost the great tragedy and comedy, and\nthat the same one will lives in all manifestations,—such a characteristic,\nI say, is the following. We sometimes see a man so deeply moved by a great\ninjury which he has experienced, or, it may be, only witnessed, that he\ndeliberately and irretrievably stakes his own life in order to take\nvengeance on the perpetrator of that wrong. We see him seek for some\nmighty oppressor through long years, murder him at last, and then himself\ndie on the scaffold, as he had foreseen, and often, it may be, did not\nseek to avoid, for his life had value for him only as a means of\nvengeance. We find examples of this especially among the Spaniards.(78)\nIf, now, we consider the spirit of that desire for retribution carefully,\nwe find that it is very different from common revenge, which seeks to\nmitigate the suffering, endured by the sight of the suffering inflicted;\nindeed, we find that what it aims at deserves to be called, not so much\nrevenge as punishment. For in it there really lies the intention of an\neffect upon the future through the example, and that without any selfish\naim, either for the avenging person, for it costs him his life, or for a\nsociety which secures its own safety by laws. For that punishment is\ncarried out by individuals, not by the state, nor is it in fulfilment of a\nlaw, but, on the contrary, always concerns a deed which the state either\nwould not or could not punish, and the punishment of which it condemns. It\nseems to me that the indignation which carries such a man so far beyond\nthe limits of all self-love springs from the deepest consciousness that he\nhimself is the whole will to live, which appears in all beings through all\ntime, and that therefore the most distant future belongs to him just as\nthe present, and cannot be indifferent to him. Asserting this will, he yet\ndesires that in the drama which represents its nature no such fearful\nwrong shall ever appear again, and wishes to frighten ever future\nwrong-doer by the example of a vengeance against which there is no means\nof defence, since the avenger is not deterred by the fear of death. The\nwill to live, though still asserting itself, does not here depend any\nlonger upon the particular phenomenon, the individual, but comprehends the\nIdea of man, and wishes to keep its manifestation pure from such a fearful\nand shocking wrong. It is a rare, very significant, and even sublime trait\nof character through which the individual sacrifices himself by striving\nto make himself the arm of eternal justice, of the true nature of which he\nis yet ignorant.",

    "page_content": "leading up to the final investigation, and have to a considerable extent\nlightened the task of raising to abstract and philosophical clearness, and\nexhibiting as a branch of our central thought that special ethical\nsignificance of action which in life is with perfect understanding denoted\nby the words _good_ and _bad_.\n\nFirst, however, I wish to trace back to their real meaning those\nconceptions of _good_ and _bad_ which have been treated by the\nphilosophical writers of the day, very extraordinarily, as simple\nconceptions, and thus incapable of analysis; so that the reader may not\nremain involved in the senseless delusion that they contain more than is\nactually the case, and express in and for themselves all that is here\nnecessary. I am in a position to do this because in ethics I am no more\ndisposed to take refuge behind the word _good_ than formerly behind the\nwords _beautiful_ and _true_, in order that by the adding a “ness,” which\nat the present day is supposed to have a special σεμνοτης, and therefore\nto be of assistance in various cases, and by assuming an air of solemnity,\nI might induce the belief that by uttering three such words I had done\nmore than denote three very wide and abstract, and consequently empty\nconceptions, of very different origin and significance. Who is there,\nindeed, who has made himself acquainted with the books of our own day to\nwhom these three words, admirable as are the things to which they\noriginally refer, have not become an aversion after he has seen for the\nthousandth time how those who are least capable of thinking believe that\nthey have only to utter these three words with open mouth and the air of\nan intelligent sheep, in order to have spoken the greatest wisdom?\n\nThe explanation of the concept _true_ has already been given in the essay\non the principle of sufficient reason, chap. v. § 29 _et seq._ The content\nof the concept _beautiful_ found for the first time its proper explanation\nthrough the whole of the Third Book of the present work. We now wish to\ndiscover the significance of the concept _good_, which can be done with\nvery little trouble. This concept is essentially relative, and signifies\n_the conformity of an object to any definite effort of the will_.\nAccordingly everything that corresponds to the will in any of its\nexpressions and fulfils its end is thought through the concept _good_,\nhowever different such things may be in other respects. Thus we speak of\ngood eating, good roads, good weather, good weapons, good omens, and so\non; in short, we call everything good that is just as we wish it to be;\nand therefore that may be good in the eyes of one man which is just the\nreverse in those of another. The conception of the good divides itself\ninto two sub-species—that of the direct and present satisfaction of any\nvolition, and that of its indirect satisfaction which has reference to the\nfuture, _i.e._, the agreeable and the useful. The conception of the\nopposite, so long as we are speaking of unconscious existence, is\nexpressed by the word _bad_, more rarely and abstractly by the word\n_evil_, which thus denotes everything that does not correspond to any\neffort of the will. Like all other things that can come into relation to\nthe will, men who are favourable to the ends which happen to be desired,\nwho further and befriend them, are called good, in the same sense, and\nalways with that relative limitation, which shows itself, for example, in\nthe expression, “I find this good, but you don’t.” Those, however, who are\nnaturally disposed not to hinder the endeavours of others, but rather to\nassist them, and who are thus consistently helpful, benevolent, friendly,\nand charitable, are called _good_ men, on account of this relation of\ntheir conduct to the will of others in general. In the case of conscious\nbeings (brutes and men) the contrary conception is denoted in German, and,\nwithin the last hundred years or so, in French also, by a different word\nfrom that which is used in speaking of unconscious existence; in German,\n_böse_; in French, _méchant_; while in almost all other languages this\ndistinction does not exist; and κακος, _malus_, _cattivo_, _bad_, are used\nof men, as of lifeless things, which are opposed to the ends of a definite\nindividual will. Thus, having started entirely from the passive element in\nthe good, the inquiry could only proceed later to the active element, and\ninvestigate the conduct of the man who is called good, no longer with\nreference to others, but to himself; specially setting itself the task of\nexplaining both the purely objective respect which such conduct produces\nin others, and the peculiar contentment with himself which it clearly\nproduces in the man himself, since he purchases it with sacrifices of\nanother kind; and also, on the other hand, the inner pain which\naccompanies the bad disposition, whatever outward advantages it brings to\nhim who entertains it. It was from this source that the ethical systems,\nboth the philosophical and those which are supported by systems of\nreligion, took their rise. Both seek constantly in some way or other to\nconnect happiness with virtue, the former either by means of the principle\nof contradiction or that of sufficient reason, and thus to make happiness\neither identical with or the consequence of virtue, always sophistically;\nthe latter, by asserting the existence of other worlds than that which\nalone can be known to experience.(79) In our system, on the contrary,\nvirtue will show itself, not as a striving after happiness, that is,\nwell-being and life, but as an effort in quite an opposite direction.\n\nIt follows from what has been said above, that the _good_ is, according to\nits concept, των πρως τι; thus every good is essentially relative, for its\nbeing consists in its relation to a desiring will. _Absolute good_ is,\ntherefore, a contradiction in terms; highest good, _summum bonum_, really\nsignifies the same thing—a final satisfaction of the will, after which no\nnew desire could arise,—a last motive, the attainment of which would\nafford enduring satisfaction of the will. But, according to the\ninvestigations which have already been conducted in this Fourth Book, such\na consummation is not even thinkable. The will can just as little cease\nfrom willing altogether on account of some particular satisfaction, as\ntime can end or begin; for it there is no such thing as a permanent\nfulfilment which shall completely and for ever satisfy its craving. It is\nthe vessel of the Danaides; for it there is no highest good, no absolute\ngood, but always a merely temporary good. If, however, we wish to give an\nhonorary position, as it were emeritus, to an old expression, which from\ncustom we do not like to discard altogether, we may, metaphorically and\nfiguratively, call the complete self-effacement and denial of the will,\nthe true absence of will, which alone for ever stills and silences its\nstruggle, alone gives that contentment which can never again be disturbed,\nalone redeems the world, and which we shall now soon consider at the close\nof our whole investigation—the absolute good, the _summum bonum_—and\nregard it as the only radical cure of the disease of which all other means\nare only palliations or anodynes. In this sense the Greek τελος and also\n_finis bonorum_ correspond to the thing still better. So much for the\nwords _good_ and _bad_; now for the thing itself.\n\nIf a man is always disposed to do _wrong_ whenever the opportunity\npresents itself, and there is no external power to restrain him, we call\nhim _bad_. According to our doctrine of wrong, this means that such a man\ndoes not merely assert the will to live as it appears in his own body, but\nin this assertion goes so far that he denies the will which appears in\nother individuals. This is shown by the fact that he desires their powers\nfor the service of his own will, and seeks to destroy their existence when\nthey stand in the way of its efforts. The ultimate source of this is a\nhigh degree of egoism, the nature of which has been already explained. Two\nthings are here apparent. In the first place, that in such a man an\nexcessively vehement will to live expresses itself, extending far beyond\nthe assertion of his own body; and, in the second place, that his\nknowledge, entirely given up to the principle of sufficient reason and\ninvolved in the _principium individuationis_, cannot get beyond the\ndifference which this latter principle establishes between his own person\nand every one else. Therefore he seeks his own well-being alone,\ncompletely indifferent to that of all others, whose existence is to him\naltogether foreign and divided from his own by a wide gulf, and who are\nindeed regarded by him as mere masks with no reality behind them. And\nthese two qualities are the constituent elements of the bad character.\n\nThis great intensity of will is in itself and directly a constant source\nof suffering. In the first place, because all volition as such arises from\nwant; that is, suffering. (Therefore, as will be remembered, from the\nThird Book, the momentary cessation of all volition, which takes place\nwhenever we give ourselves up to æsthetic contemplation, as pure will-less\nsubject of knowledge, the correlative of the Idea, is one of the principal\nelements in our pleasure in the beautiful.) Secondly, because, through the\ncausal connection of things, most of our desires must remain unfulfilled,\nand the will is oftener crossed than satisfied, and therefore much intense\nvolition carries with it much intense suffering. For all suffering is\nsimply unfulfilled and crossed volition; and even the pain of the body\nwhen it is injured or destroyed is as such only possible through the fact\nthat the body is nothing but the will itself become object. Now on this\naccount, because much intense suffering is inseparable from much intense\nvolition, very bad men bear the stamp of inward suffering in the very\nexpression of the countenance; even when they have attained every external\nhappiness, they always look unhappy so long as they are not transported by\nsome momentary ecstasy and are not dissembling. From this inward torment,\nwhich is absolutely and directly essential to them, there finally proceeds\nthat delight in the suffering of others which does not spring from mere\negoism, but is disinterested, and which constitutes _wickedness_ proper,\nrising to the pitch of _cruelty_. For this the suffering of others is not\na means for the attainment of the ends of its own will, but an end in\nitself. The more definite explanation of this phenomenon is as\nfollows:—Since man is a manifestation of will illuminated by the clearest\nknowledge, he is always contrasting the actual and felt satisfaction of\nhis will with the merely possible satisfaction of it which knowledge\npresents to him. Hence arises envy: every privation is infinitely\nincreased by the enjoyment of others, and relieved by the knowledge that\nothers also suffer the same privation. Those ills which are common to all\nand inseparable from human life trouble us little, just as those which\nbelong to the climate, to the whole country. The recollection of greater\nsufferings than our own stills our pain; the sight of the sufferings of\nothers soothes our own. If, now, a man is filled with an exceptionally\nintense pressure of will,—if with burning eagerness he seeks to accumulate\neverything to slake the thirst of his egoism, and thus experiences, as he\ninevitably must, that all satisfaction is merely apparent, that the\nattained end never fulfils the promise of the desired object, the final\nappeasing of the fierce pressure of will, but that when fulfilled the wish\nonly changes its form, and now torments him in a new one; and indeed that\nif at last all wishes are exhausted, the pressure of will itself remains\nwithout any conscious motive, and makes itself known to him with fearful\npain as a feeling of terrible desolation and emptiness; if from all this,\nwhich in the case of the ordinary degrees of volition is only felt in a\nsmall measure, and only produces the ordinary degree of melancholy, in the\ncase of him who is a manifestation of will reaching the point of\nextraordinary wickedness, there necessarily springs an excessive inward\nmisery, an eternal unrest, an incurable pain; he seeks indirectly the\nalleviation which directly is denied him,—seeks to mitigate his own\nsuffering by the sight of the suffering of others, which at the same time\nhe recognises as an expression of his power. The suffering of others now\nbecomes for him an end in itself, and is a spectacle in which he delights;\nand thus arises the phenomenon of pure cruelty, blood-thirstiness, which\nhistory exhibits so often in the Neros and Domitians, in the African Deis,\nin Robespierre, and the like.\n\nThe desire of revenge is closely related to wickedness. It recompenses\nevil with evil, not with reference to the future, which is the character\nof punishment, but merely on account of what has happened, what is past,\nas such, thus disinterestedly, not as a means, but as an end, in order to\nrevel in the torment which the avenger himself has inflicted on the\noffender. What distinguishes revenge from pure wickedness, and to some\nextent excuses it, is an appearance of justice. For if the same act, which\nis now revenge, were to be done legally, that is, according to a\npreviously determined and known rule, and in a society which had\nsanctioned this rule, it would be punishment, and thus justice.\n\nBesides the suffering which has been described, and which is inseparable\nfrom wickedness, because it springs from the same root, excessive\nvehemence of will, another specific pain quite different from this is\nconnected with wickedness, which is felt in the case of every bad action,\nwhether it be merely injustice proceeding from egoism or pure wickedness,\nand according to the length of its duration is called _the sting of\nconscience_ or _remorse_. Now, whoever remembers and has present in his\nmind the content of the preceding portion of this Fourth Book, and\nespecially the truth explained at the beginning of it, that life itself is\nalways assured to the will to live, as its mere copy or mirror, and also\nthe exposition of eternal justice, will find that the sting of conscience\ncan have no other meaning than the following, _i.e._, its content,\nabstractly expressed, is what follows, in which two parts are\ndistinguished, which again, however, entirely coincide, and must be\nthought as completely united.\n\nHowever closely the veil of Mâyâ may envelop the mind of the bad man,\n_i.e._, however firmly he may be involved in the _principium\nindividuationis_, according to which he regards his person as absolutely\ndifferent and separated by a wide gulf from all others, a knowledge to\nwhich he clings with all his might, as it alone suits and supports his\negoism, so that knowledge is almost always corrupted by will, yet there\narises in the inmost depths of his consciousness the secret presentiment\nthat such an order of things is only phenomenal, and that their real\nconstitution is quite different. He has a dim foreboding that, however\nmuch time and space may separate him from other individuals and the\ninnumerable miseries which they suffer, and even suffer through him, and\nmay represent them as quite foreign to him, yet in themselves, and apart\nfrom the idea and its forms, it is the one will to live appearing in them\nall, which here failing to recognise itself, turns its weapons against\nitself, and, by seeking increased happiness in one of its phenomena,\nimposes the greatest suffering upon another. He dimly sees that he, the\nbad man, is himself this whole will; that consequently he is not only the\ninflicter of pain but also the endurer of it, from whose suffering he is\nonly separated and exempted by an illusive dream, the form of which is\nspace and time, which, however, vanishes away; that he must in reality pay\nfor the pleasure with the pain, and that all suffering which he only knows\nas possible really concerns him as the will to live, inasmuch as the\npossible and actual, the near and the distant in time and space, are only\ndifferent for the knowledge of the individual, only by means of the\n_principium individuationis_, not in themselves. This is the truth which\nmythically, _i.e._, adapted to the principle of sufficient reason, and so\ntranslated into the form of the phenomenal, is expressed in the\ntransmigration of souls. Yet it has its purest expression, free from all\nforeign admixture, in that obscurely felt yet inconsolable misery called\nremorse. But this springs also from a second immediate knowledge, which is\nclosely bound to the first—the knowledge of the strength with which the\nwill to live asserts itself in the wicked individual, which extends far\nbeyond his own individual phenomenon, to the absolute denial of the same\nwill appearing in other individuals. Consequently the inward horror of the\nwicked man at his own deed, which he himself tries to conceal, contains,\nbesides that presentment of the nothingness, the mere illusiveness of the\n_principium individuationis_, and of the distinction established by it\nbetween him and others; also the knowledge of the vehemence of his own\nwill, the intensity with which he has seized upon life and attached\nhimself closely to it, even that life whose terrible side he sees before\nhim in the misery of those who are oppressed by him, and with which he is\nyet so firmly united, that just on this account the greatest atrocity\nproceeds from him himself, as a means for the fuller assertion of his own\nwill. He recognises himself as the concentrated manifestation of the will\nto live, feels to what degree he is given up to life, and with it also to\ninnumerable sufferings which are essential to it, for it has infinite time\nand infinite space to abolish the distinction between the possible and the\nactual, and to change all the sufferings which as yet are merely _known_\nto him into sufferings he has _experienced_. The millions of years of\nconstant rebirth certainly exist, like the whole past and future, only in\nconception; occupied time, the form of the phenomenon of the will, is only\nthe present, and for the individual time is ever new: it seems to him\nalways as if he had newly come into being. For life is inseparable from\nthe will to live, and the only form of life is the present. Death (the\nrepetition of the comparison must be excused) is like the setting of the\nsun, which is only apparently swallowed up by the night, but in reality,\nitself the source of all light, burns without intermission, brings new\ndays to new worlds, is always rising and always setting. Beginning and end\nonly concern the individual through time, the form of the phenomenon for\nthe idea. Outside time lies only the will, Kant’s thing-in-itself, and its\nadequate objectification, the Idea of Plato. Therefore suicide affords no\nescape; what every one in his inmost consciousness _wills_, that must he\n_be_; and what every one _is_, that he _wills_. Thus, besides the merely\nfelt knowledge of the illusiveness and nothingness of the forms of the\nidea which separate individuals, it is the self-knowledge of one’s own\nwill and its degree that gives the sting to conscience. The course of life\ndraws the image of the empirical character, whose original is the\nintelligible character, and horrifies the wicked man by this image. He is\nhorrified all the same whether the image is depicted in large characters,\nso that the world shares his horror, or in such small ones that he alone\nsees it, for it only concerns him directly. The past would be a matter of\nindifference, and could not pain the conscience if the character did not\nfeel itself free from all time and unalterable by it, so long as it does\nnot deny itself. Therefore things which are long past still weigh on the\nconscience. The prayer, “Lead me not into temptation,” means, “Let me not\nsee what manner of person I am.” In the might with which the bad man\nasserts life, and which exhibits itself to him in the sufferings which he\ninflicts on others, he measures how far he is from the surrender and\ndenial of that will, the only possible deliverance from the world and its\nmiseries. He sees how far he belongs to it, and how firmly he is bound to\nit; the _known_ suffering of others has no power to move him; he is given\nup to life and _felt_ suffering. It remains hidden whether this will ever\nbreak and overcome the vehemence of his will.\n\nThis exposition of the significance and inner nature of the _bad_, which\nas mere feeling, _i.e._, not as distinct, abstract knowledge, is the\ncontent of _remorse_, will gain distinctness and completeness by the\nsimilar consideration of the _good_ as a quality of human will, and\nfinally of absolute resignation and holiness, which proceeds from it when\nit has attained its highest grade. For opposites always throw light upon\neach other, and the day at once reveals both itself and the night, as\nSpinoza admirably remarks.",

    "page_content": "effect nothing, because it does not act as a motive. A theory of morals\nwhich does act as a motive can do so only by working on self-love. But\nwhat springs from this source has no moral worth. It follows from this\nthat no genuine virtue can be produced through moral theory or abstract\nknowledge in general, but that such virtue must spring from that intuitive\nknowledge which recognises in the individuality of others the same nature\nas in our own.\n\nFor virtue certainly proceeds from knowledge, but not from the abstract\nknowledge that can be communicated through words. If it were so, virtue\ncould be taught, and by here expressing in abstract language its nature\nand the knowledge which lies at its foundation, we should make every one\nwho comprehends this even ethically better. But this is by no means the\ncase. On the contrary, ethical discourses and preaching will just as\nlittle produce a virtuous man as all the systems of æsthetics from\nAristotle downwards have succeeded in producing a poet. For the real inner\nnature of virtue the concept is unfruitful, just as it is in art, and it\nis only in a completely subordinate position that it can be of use as a\ntool in the elaboration and preserving of what has been ascertained and\ninferred by other means. _Velle non discitur._ Abstract dogmas are, in\nfact, without influence upon virtue, _i.e._, upon the goodness of the\ndisposition. False dogmas do not disturb it; true ones will scarcely\nassist it. It would, in fact, be a bad look-out if the cardinal fact in\nthe life of man, his ethical worth, that worth which counts for eternity,\nwere dependent upon anything the attainment of which is so much a matter\nof chance as is the case with dogmas, religious doctrines, and\nphilosophical theories. For morality dogmas have this value only: The man\nwho has become virtuous from knowledge of another kind, which is presently\nto be considered, possesses in them a scheme or formula according to which\nhe accounts to his own reason, for the most part fictitiously, for his\nnon-egoistical action, the nature of which it, _i.e._, he himself, does\nnot comprehend, and with which account he has accustomed it to be content.\n\nUpon conduct, outward action, dogmas may certainly exercise a powerful\ninfluence, as also custom and example (the last because the ordinary man\ndoes not trust his judgment, of the weakness of which he is conscious, but\nonly follows his own or some one else’s experience), but the disposition\nis not altered in this way.(80) All abstract knowledge gives only motives;\nbut, as was shown above, motives can only alter the direction of the will,\nnot the will itself. All communicable knowledge, however, can only affect\nthe will as a motive. Thus when dogmas lead it, what the man really and in\ngeneral wills remains still the same. He has only received different\nthoughts as to the ways in which it is to be attained, and imaginary\nmotives guide him just like real ones. Therefore, for example, it is all\none, as regards his ethical worth, whether he gives large gifts to the\npoor, firmly persuaded that he will receive everything tenfold in a future\nlife, or expends the same sum on the improvement of an estate which will\nyield interest, certainly late, but all the more surely and largely. And\nhe who for the sake of orthodoxy commits the heretic to the flames is as\nmuch a murderer as the bandit who does it for gain; and indeed, as regards\ninward circumstances, so also was he who slaughtered the Turks in the Holy\nLand, if, like the burner of heretics, he really did so because he thought\nthat he would thereby gain a place in heaven. For these are careful only\nfor themselves, for their own egoism, just like the bandit, from whom they\nare only distinguished by the absurdity of their means. From without, as\nhas been said, the will can only be reached through motives, and these\nonly alter the way in which it expresses itself, never the will itself.\n_Velle non discitur._\n\nIn the case of good deeds, however, the doer of which appeals to dogmas,\nwe must always distinguish whether these dogmas really are the motives\nwhich lead to the good deeds, or whether, as was said above, they are\nmerely the illusive account of them with which he seeks to satisfy his own\nreason with regard to a good deed which really flows from quite a\ndifferent source, a deed which he does because he is good, though he does\nnot understand how to explain it rightly, and yet wishes to think\nsomething with regard to it. But this distinction is very hard to make,\nbecause it lies in the heart of a man. Therefore we can scarcely ever pass\na correct moral judgment on the action of others, and very seldom on our\nown. The deeds and conduct of an individual and of a nation may be very\nmuch modified through dogmas, example, and custom. But in themselves all\ndeeds (_opera operata_) are merely empty forms, and only the disposition\nwhich leads to them gives them moral significance. This disposition,\nhowever, may be quite the same when its outward manifestation is very\ndifferent. With an equal degree of wickedness, one man may die on the\nwheel, and another in the bosom of his family. It may be the same grade of\nwickedness which expresses itself in one nation in the coarse\ncharacteristics of murder and cannibalism, and in another finely and\nsoftly in miniature, in court intrigues, oppressions, and delicate plots\nof every kind; the inner nature remains the same. It is conceivable that a\nperfect state, or perhaps indeed a complete and firmly believed doctrine\nof rewards and punishments after death, might prevent every crime;\npolitically much would be gained thereby; morally, nothing; only the\nexpression of the will in life would be restricted.\n\nThus genuine goodness of disposition, disinterested virtue, and pure\nnobility do not proceed from abstract knowledge. Yet they do proceed from\nknowledge; but it is a direct intuitive knowledge, which can neither be\nreasoned away, nor arrived at by reasoning, a knowledge which, just\nbecause it is not abstract, cannot be communicated, but must arise in each\nfor himself, which therefore finds its real and adequate expression not in\nwords, but only in deeds, in conduct, in the course of the life of man. We\nwho here seek the theory of virtue, and have therefore also to express\nabstractly the nature of the knowledge which lies at its foundation, will\nyet be unable to convey that knowledge itself in this expression. We can\nonly give the concept of this knowledge, and thus always start from action\nin which alone it becomes visible, and refer to action as its only\nadequate expression. We can only explain and interpret action, _i.e._,\nexpress abstractly what really takes place in it.\n\nBefore we speak of the _good_ proper, in opposition to the _bad_, which\nhas been explained, we must touch on an intermediate grade, the mere\nnegation of the bad: this is _justice_. The nature of right and wrong has\nbeen fully explained above; therefore we may briefly say here, that he who\nvoluntarily recognises and observes those merely moral limits between\nwrong and right, even where this is not secured by the state or any other\nexternal power, thus he who, according to our explanation, never carries\nthe assertion of his own will so far as to deny the will appearing in\nanother individual, is _just_. Thus, in order to increase his own\nwell-being, he will not inflict suffering upon others, _i.e._, he will\ncommit no crime, he will respect the rights and the property of others. We\nsee that for such a just man the _principium individuationis_ is no\nlonger, as in the case of the bad man, an absolute wall of partition. We\nsee that he does not, like the bad man, merely assert his own\nmanifestation of will and deny all others; that other persons are not for\nhim mere masks, whose nature is quite different from his own; but he shows\nin his conduct that he also recognises his own nature—the will to live as\na thing-in-itself, in the foreign manifestation which is only given to him\nas idea. Thus he finds himself again in that other manifestation, up to a\ncertain point, that of doing no wrong, _i.e._, abstaining from injury. To\nthis extent, therefore, he sees through the _principium individuationis_,\nthe veil of Mâyâ; so far he sets the being external to him on a level with\nhis own—he does it no injury.\n\nIf we examine the inmost nature of this justice, there already lies in it\nthe resolution not to go so far in the assertion of one’s own will as to\ndeny the manifestations of will of others, by compelling them to serve\none’s own. One will therefore wish to render to others as much as one\nreceives from them. The highest degree of this justice of disposition,\nwhich is, however, always united with goodness proper, whose character is\nno longer merely negative, extends so far that a man doubts his right to\ninherited property, wishes to support his body only by his own powers,\nmental and physical, feels every service of others and every luxury a\nreproach, and finally embraces voluntary poverty. Thus we see how Pascal,\nwhen he became an ascetic, would no longer permit any services to be\nrendered him, although he had servants enough; in spite of his constant\nbad health he made his bed himself, brought his own food from the kitchen,\n&c. (“Vie de Pascal, par sa Sœur,” p. 19). Quite in keeping with this, it\nis reported that many Hindus, even Rajas with great wealth, expend it\nmerely on the maintenance of their position, their court and attendants,\nand themselves observe with the greatest scrupulousness the maxim that a\nman should eat nothing that he has not himself both sowed and reaped. Yet\na certain misunderstanding lies at the bottom of this; for one man, just\nbecause he is rich and powerful, can render such signal services to the\nwhole of human society that they counterbalance the wealth he has\ninherited, for the secure possession of which he is indebted to society.\nIn reality that excessive justice of such Hindus is already more than\njustice; it is actual renunciation, denial of the will to\nlive,—asceticism, of which we shall speak last. On the other hand, pure\nidleness and living through the exertions of others, in the case of\ninherited wealth, without accomplishing anything, may be regarded as\nmorally wrong, even if it must remain right according to positive laws.\n\nWe have found that voluntary justice has its inmost source in a certain\ndegree of penetration of the _principium individuationis_, while the\nunjust remain entirely involved in this principle. This penetration may\nexist not only in the degree which is required for justice, but also in\nthe higher degree which leads to benevolence and well-doing, to love of\nmankind. And this may take place however strong and energetic in itself\nthe will which appears in such an individual may be. Knowledge can always\ncounterbalance it in him, teach him to resist the tendency to wrong, and\neven produce in him every degree of goodness, and indeed of resignation.\nThus the good man is by no means to be regarded as originally a weaker\nmanifestation of will than the bad man, but it is knowledge which in him\nmasters the blind striving of will. There are certainly individuals who\nmerely seem to have a good disposition on account of the weakness of the\nwill appearing in them, but what they are soon appears from the fact that\nthey are not capable of any remarkable self-conquest in order to perform a\njust or good deed.\n\nIf, however, as a rare exception, we meet a man who possesses a\nconsiderable income, but uses very little of it for himself and gives all\nthe rest to the poor, while he denies himself many pleasures and comforts,\nand we seek to explain the action of this man, we shall find, apart\naltogether from the dogmas through which he tries to make his action\nintelligible to his reason, that the simplest general expression and the\nessential character of his conduct is that _he makes less distinction than\nis usually made between himself and others_. This distinction is so great\nin the eyes of many that the suffering of others is a direct pleasure to\nthe wicked and a welcome means of happiness to the unjust. The merely just\nman is content not to cause it; and, in general, most men know and are\nacquainted with innumerable sufferings of others in their vicinity, but do\nnot determine to mitigate them, because to do so would involve some\nself-denial on their part. Thus, in each of all these a strong distinction\nseems to prevail between his own ego and that of others; on the other\nhand, to the noble man we have imagined, this distinction is not so\nsignificant. The _principium individuationis_, the form of the phenomenon,\nno longer holds him so tightly in its grasp, but the suffering which he\nsees in others touches him almost as closely as his own. He therefore\ntries to strike a balance between them, denies himself pleasures,\npractises renunciation, in order to mitigate the sufferings of others. He\nsees that the distinction between himself and others, which to the bad man\nis so great a gulf, only belongs to a fleeting and illusive phenomenon. He\nrecognises directly and without reasoning that the in-itself of his own\nmanifestation is also that of others, the will to live, which constitutes\nthe inner nature of everything and lives in all; indeed, that this applies\nalso to the brutes and the whole of nature, and therefore he will not\ncause suffering even to a brute.(81)\n\nHe is now just as little likely to allow others to starve, while he\nhimself has enough and to spare, as any one would be to suffer hunger one\nday in order to have more the next day than he could enjoy. For to him who\ndoes works of love the veil of Mâyâ has become transparent, the illusion\nof the _principium individuationis_ has left him. He recognises himself,\nhis will, in every being, and consequently also in the sufferer. He is now\nfree from the perversity with which the will to live, not recognising\nitself, here in one individual enjoys a fleeting and precarious pleasure,\nand there in another pays for it with suffering and starvation, and thus\nboth inflicts and endures misery, not knowing that, like Thyestes, it\neagerly devours its own flesh; and then, on the one hand, laments its\nundeserved suffering, and on the other hand transgresses without fear of\nNemesis, always merely because, involved in the _principium\nindividuationis_, thus generally in the kind of knowledge which is\ngoverned by the principle of sufficient reason, it does not recognise\nitself in the foreign phenomenon, and therefore does not perceive eternal\njustice. To be cured of this illusion and deception of Mâyâ, and to do\nworks of love, are one and the same. But the latter is the necessary and\ninevitable symptom of that knowledge.\n\nThe opposite of the sting of conscience, the origin and significance of\nwhich is explained above, is the _good conscience_, the satisfaction which\nwe experience after every disinterested deed. It arises from the fact that\nsuch a deed, as it proceeds from the direct recognition of our own inner\nbeing in the phenomenon of another, affords us also the verification of\nthis knowledge, the knowledge that our true self exists not only in our\nown person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives.\nBy this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egoism it is contracted.\nFor as the latter concentrates our interest upon the particular\nmanifestation of our own individuality, upon which knowledge always\npresents to us the innumerable dangers which constantly threaten this\nmanifestation, and anxiety and care becomes the key-note of our\ndisposition; the knowledge that everything living is just as much our own\ninner nature, as is our own person, extends our interest to everything\nliving; and in this way the heart is enlarged. Thus through the diminished\ninterest in our own self, the anxious care for the self is attacked at its\nvery root and limited; hence the peace, the unbroken serenity, which a\nvirtuous disposition and a good conscience affords, and the more distinct\nappearance of this with every good deed, for it proves to ourselves the\ndepth of that disposition. The egoist feels himself surrounded by strange\nand hostile individuals, and all his hope is centred in his own good. The\ngood man lives in a world of friendly individuals, the well-being of any\nof whom he regards as his own. Therefore, although the knowledge of the\nlot of mankind generally does not make his disposition a joyful one, yet\nthe permanent knowledge of his own nature in all living beings, gives him\na certain evenness, and even serenity of disposition. For the interest\nwhich is extended to innumerable manifestations cannot cause such anxiety\nas that which is concentrated upon one. The accidents which concern\nindividuals collectively, equalise themselves, while those which happen to\nthe particular individual constitute good or bad fortune.\n\nThus, though others have set up moral principles which they give out as\nprescriptions for virtue, and laws which it was necessary to follow, I, as\nhas already been said, cannot do this because I have no “ought” or law to\nprescribe to the eternally free-will. Yet on the other hand, in the\nconnection of my system, what to a certain extent corresponds and is\nanalogous to that undertaking is the purely theoretical truth, of which my\nwhole exposition may be regarded as merely an elaboration, that the will\nis the in-itself of every phenomenon but itself, as such, is free from the\nforms of the phenomenal, and consequently from multiplicity; a truth,\nwhich, with reference to action, I do not know how to express better than\nby the formula of the Vedas already quoted: “Tat twam asi!” (This thou\nart!) Whoever is able to say this to himself, with regard to every being\nwith whom he comes in contact, with clear knowledge and firm inward\nconviction, is certain of all virtue and blessedness, and is on the direct\nroad to salvation.\n\nBut before I go further, and, as the conclusion of my exposition, show how\nlove, the origin and nature of which we recognised as the penetration of\nthe _principium individuationis_, leads to salvation, to the entire\nsurrender of the will to live, _i.e._, of all volition, and also how\nanother path, less soft but more frequented, leads men to the same goal, a\nparadoxical proposition must first be stated and explained; not because it\nis paradoxical, but because it is true, and is necessary to the\ncompleteness of the thought I have present. It is this: “All love (αγαπη,\n_caritas_) is sympathy.”",

    "page_content": "_principium individuationis_ in a less degree, and how from its\npenetration in a higher degree there arises goodness of disposition\nproper, which shows itself as pure, _i.e._, disinterested love towards\nothers. When now the latter becomes perfect, it places other individuals\nand their fate completely on a level with itself and its own fate. Further\nthan this it cannot go, for there exists no reason for preferring the\nindividuality of another to its own. Yet the number of other individuals\nwhose whole happiness or life is in danger may outweigh the regard for\none’s own particular well-being. In such a case, the character that has\nattained to the highest goodness and perfect nobility will entirely\nsacrifice its own well-being, and even its life, for the well-being of\nmany others. So died Codrus, and Leonidas, and Regulus, and Decius Mus,\nand Arnold von Winkelried; so dies every one who voluntarily and\nconsciously faces certain death for his friends or his country. And they\nalso stand on the same level who voluntarily submit to suffering and death\nfor maintaining what conduces and rightly belongs to the welfare of all\nmankind; that is, for maintaining universal and important truths and\ndestroying great errors. So died Socrates and Giordano Bruno, and so many\na hero of the truth suffered death at the stake at the hands of the\npriests.\n\nNow, however, I must remind the reader, with reference to the paradox\nstated above, that we found before that suffering is essential to life as\na whole, and inseparable from it. And that we saw that every wish proceeds\nfrom a need, from a want, from suffering, and that therefore every\nsatisfaction is only the removal of a pain, and brings no positive\nhappiness; that the joys certainly lie to the wish, presenting themselves\nas a positive good, but in truth they have only a negative nature, and are\nonly the end of an evil. Therefore what goodness, love, and nobleness do\nfor others, is always merely an alleviation of their suffering, and\nconsequently all that can influence them to good deeds and works of love,\nis simply the _knowledge of the suffering of others_, which is directly\nunderstood from their own suffering and placed on a level with it. But it\nfollows from this that pure love (αγαπη, _caritas_) is in its nature\nsympathy; whether the suffering it mitigates, to which every unsatisfied\nwish belongs, be great or small. Therefore we shall have no hesitation, in\ndirect contradiction to Kant, who will only recognise all true goodness\nand all virtue to be such, if it has proceeded from abstract reflection,\nand indeed from the conception of duty and of the categorical imperative,\nand explains felt sympathy as weakness, and by no means virtue, we shall\nhave no hesitation, I say, in direct contradiction to Kant, in saying: the\nmere concept is for genuine virtue just as unfruitful as it is for genuine\nart: all true and pure love is sympathy, and all love which is not\nsympathy is selfishness. Ερος is selfishness, αγαπη is sympathy.\nCombinations of the two frequently occur. Indeed genuine friendship is\nalways a mixture of selfishness and sympathy; the former lies in the\npleasure experienced in the presence of the friend, whose individuality\ncorresponds to our own, and this almost always constitutes the greatest\npart; sympathy shows itself in the sincere participation in his joy and\ngrief, and the disinterested sacrifices made in respect of the latter.\nThus Spinoza says: _Benevolentia nihil aliud est, quam cupiditas ex\ncommiseratione orta_ (Eth. iii. pr. 27, cor. 3, schol.) As a confirmation\nof our paradoxical proposition it may be observed that the tone and words\nof the language and caresses of pure love, entirely coincide with the\ntones of sympathy; and we may also remark in passing that in Italian\nsympathy and true love are denoted by the same word _pietà_.\n\nThis is also the place to explain one of the most striking peculiarities\nof human nature, _weeping_, which, like laughter, belongs to those\nqualities which distinguish man from the brutes. Weeping is by no means a\ndirect expression of pain, for it occurs where there is very little pain.\nIn my opinion, indeed, we never weep directly on account of the pain we\nexperience, but always merely on account of its repetition in reflection.\nWe pass from the felt pain, even when it is physical, to a mere idea of\nit, and then find our own state so deserving of sympathy that we are\nfirmly and sincerely convinced that if another were the sufferer, we would\nbe full of sympathy, and love to relieve him. But now we ourselves are the\nobject of our own sympathy; with the most benevolent disposition we are\nourselves most in need of help; we feel that we suffer more than we could\nsee another suffer; and in this very complex frame of mind, in which the\ndirectly felt suffering only comes to perception by a doubly circuitous\nroute, imagined as the suffering of another, sympathised with as such, and\nthen suddenly perceived again as directly our own,—in this complex frame\nof mind, I say, Nature relieves itself through that remarkable physical\nconflict. _Weeping_ is accordingly _sympathy with our own selves_, or\nsympathy directed back on its source. It is therefore conditional upon the\ncapacity for love and sympathy, and also upon imagination. Therefore men\nwho are either hard-hearted or unimaginative do not weep easily, and\nweeping is even always regarded as a sign of a certain degree of goodness\nof character, and disarms anger, because it is felt that whoever can still\nweep, must necessarily always be capable of love, _i.e._, sympathy towards\nothers, for this enters in the manner described into the disposition that\nleads to weeping. The description which Petrarch gives of the rising of\nhis own tears, naïvely and truly expressing his feeling, entirely agrees\nwith the explanation we have given—\n\n    “I vo pensando: e nel pensar m’ assale\n    _Una pietà si forte di me stesso_,\n    Che mi conduce spesso,\n    Ad alto lagrimar, ch’i non soleva.”(82)\n\nWhat has been said is also confirmed by the fact that children who have\nbeen hurt generally do not cry till some one commiserates them; thus not\non account of the pain, but on account of the idea of it. When we are\nmoved to tears, not through our own suffering but through that of another,\nthis happens as follows. Either we vividly put ourselves in the place of\nthe sufferer by imagination, or see in his fate the lot of humanity as a\nwhole, and consequently, first of all, our own lot; and thus, in a very\nroundabout way, it is yet always about ourselves that we weep, sympathy\nwith ourselves which we feel. This seems to be the principal reason of the\nuniversal, and thus natural, weeping in the case of death. The mourner\ndoes not weep for his loss; he would be ashamed of such egotistical tears,\ninstead of which he is sometimes ashamed of not weeping. First of all he\ncertainly weeps for the fate of the dead, but he also weeps when, after\nlong, heavy, and incurable suffering, death was to this man a wished-for\ndeliverance. Thus, principally, he is seized with sympathy for the lot of\nall mankind, which is necessarily finite, so that every life, however\naspiring, and often rich in deeds, must be extinguished and become\nnothing. But in this lot of mankind the mourner sees first of all his own,\nand this all the more, the more closely he is related to him who has died,\nthus most of all if it is his father. Although to his father his life was\nmisery through age and sickness, and though his helplessness was a heavy\nburden to his son, yet that son weeps bitterly over the death of his\nfather for the reason which has been given.(83)",

    "page_content": "the final return of which upon our own individuality has, as its symptom,\nthe phenomenon of weeping, I now take up the thread of our discussion of\nthe ethical significance of action, in order to show how, from the same\nsource from which all goodness, love, virtue, and nobility of character\nspring, there finally arises that which I call the denial of the will to\nlive.\n\nWe saw before that hatred and wickedness are conditioned by egoism, and\negoism rests on the entanglement of knowledge in the _principium\nindividuationis_. Thus we found that the penetration of that _principium\nindividuationis_ is the source and the nature of justice, and when it is\ncarried further, even to its fullest extent, it is the source and nature\nof love and nobility of character. For this penetration alone, by\nabolishing the distinction between our own individuality and that of\nothers, renders possible and explains perfect goodness of disposition,\nextending to disinterested love and the most generous self-sacrifice for\nothers.\n\nIf, however, this penetration of the _principium individuationis_, this\ndirect knowledge of the identity of will in all its manifestations, is\npresent in a high degree of distinctness, it will at once show an\ninfluence upon the will which extends still further. If that veil of Mâyâ,\nthe _principium individuationis_, is lifted from the eyes of a man to such\nan extent that he no longer makes the egotistical distinction between his\nperson and that of others, but takes as much interest in the sufferings of\nother individuals as in his own, and therefore is not only benevolent in\nthe highest degree, but even ready to sacrifice his own individuality\nwhenever such a sacrifice will save a number of other persons, then it\nclearly follows that such a man, who recognises in all beings his own\ninmost and true self, must also regard the infinite suffering of all\nsuffering beings as his own, and take on himself the pain of the whole\nworld. No suffering is any longer strange to him. All the miseries of\nothers which he sees and is so seldom able to alleviate, all the miseries\nhe knows directly, and even those which he only knows as possible, work\nupon his mind like his own. It is no longer the changing joy and sorrow of\nhis own person that he has in view, as is the case with him who is still\ninvolved in egoism; but, since he sees through the _principium\nindividuationis_, all lies equally near him. He knows the whole,\ncomprehends its nature, and finds that it consists in a constant passing\naway, vain striving, inward conflict, and continual suffering. He sees\nwherever he looks suffering humanity, the suffering brute creation, and a\nworld that passes away. But all this now lies as near him as his own\nperson lies to the egoist. Why should he now, with such knowledge of the\nworld, assert this very life through constant acts of will, and thereby\nbind himself ever more closely to it, press it ever more firmly to\nhimself? Thus he who is still involved in the _principium\nindividuationis_, in egoism, only knows particular things and their\nrelation to his own person, and these constantly become new _motives_ of\nhis volition. But, on the other hand, that knowledge of the whole, of the\nnature of the thing-in-itself which has been described, becomes a\n_quieter_ of all and every volition. The will now turns away from life; it\nnow shudders at the pleasures in which it recognises the assertion of\nlife. Man now attains to the state of voluntary renunciation, resignation,\ntrue indifference, and perfect will-lessness. If at times, in the hard\nexperience of our own suffering, or in the vivid recognition of that of\nothers, the knowledge of the vanity and bitterness of life draws nigh to\nus also who are still wrapt in the veil of Mâyâ, and we would like to\ndestroy the sting of the desires, close the entrance against all\nsuffering, and purify and sanctify ourselves by complete and final\nrenunciation; yet the illusion of the phenomenon soon entangles us again,\nand its motives influence the will anew; we cannot tear ourselves free.\nThe allurement of hope, the flattery of the present, the sweetness of\npleasure, the well-being which falls to our lot, amid the lamentations of\na suffering world governed by chance and error, draws us back to it and\nrivets our bonds anew. Therefore Jesus says: “It is easier for a camel to\ngo through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the\nkingdom of God.”\n\nIf we compare life to a course or path through which we must unceasingly\nrun—a path of red-hot coals, with a few cool places here and there; then\nhe who is entangled in delusion is consoled by the cool places, on which\nhe now stands, or which he sees near him, and sets out to run through the\ncourse. But he who sees through the _principium individuationis_, and\nrecognises the real nature of the thing-in-itself, and thus the whole, is\nno longer susceptible of such consolation; he sees himself in all places\nat once, and withdraws. His will turns round, no longer asserts its own\nnature, which is reflected in the phenomenon, but denies it. The\nphenomenon by which this change is marked, is the transition from virtue\nto asceticism. That is to say, it no longer suffices for such a man to\nlove others as himself, and to do as much for them as for himself; but\nthere arises within him a horror of the nature of which his own phenomenal\nexistence is an expression, the will to live, the kernel and inner nature\nof that world which is recognised as full of misery. He therefore disowns\nthis nature which appears in him, and is already expressed through his\nbody, and his action gives the lie to his phenomenal existence, and\nappears in open contradiction to it. Essentially nothing else but a\nmanifestation of will, he ceases to will anything, guards against\nattaching his will to anything, and seeks to confirm in himself the\ngreatest indifference to everything. His body, healthy and strong,\nexpresses through the genitals, the sexual impulse; but he denies the will\nand gives the lie to the body; he desires no sensual gratification under\nany condition. Voluntary and complete chastity is the first step in\nasceticism or the denial of the will to live. It thereby denies the\nassertion of the will which extends beyond the individual life, and gives\nthe assurance that with the life of this body, the will, whose\nmanifestation it is, ceases. Nature, always true and naïve, declares that\nif this maxim became universal, the human race would die out; and I think\nI may assume, in accordance with what was said in the Second Book about\nthe connection of all manifestations of will, that with its highest\nmanifestation, the weaker reflection of it would also pass away, as the\ntwilight vanishes along with the full light. With the entire abolition of\nknowledge, the rest of the world would of itself vanish into nothing; for\nwithout a subject there is no object. I should like here to refer to a\npassage in the Vedas, where it is said: “As in this world hungry infants\npress round their mother; so do all beings await the holy oblation.”\n(Asiatic Researches, vol. viii.; Colebrooke, On the Vedas, Abstract of the\nSama-Veda; also in Colebrooke’s Miscellaneous Essays, vol. i. p. 79.)\nSacrifice means resignation generally, and the rest of nature must look\nfor its salvation to man who is at once the priest and the sacrifice.\nIndeed it deserves to be noticed as very remarkable, that this thought has\nalso been expressed by the admirable and unfathomably profound Angelus\nSilesius, in the little poem entitled, “Man brings all to God;” it runs,\n“Man! all loves thee; around thee great is the throng. All things flee to\nthee that they may attain to God.” But a yet greater mystic, Meister\nEckhard, whose wonderful writings are at last accessible (1857) through\nthe edition of Franz Pfeiffer, says the same thing (p. 459) quite in the\nsense explained here: “I bear witness to the saying of Christ. I, if I be\nlifted up from the earth, will draw all things unto me (John xii. 32). So\nshall the good man draw all things up to God, to the source whence they\nfirst came. The Masters certify to us that all creatures are made for the\nsake of man. This is proved in all created things, by the fact that the\none makes the use of the other; the ox makes use of the grass, the fish of\nthe water, the bird of the air, the wild beast of the forest. Thus, all\ncreated things become of use to the good man. A good man brings to God the\none created thing in the other.” He means to say, that man makes use of\nthe brutes in this life because, in and with himself, he saves them also.\nIt also seems to me that that difficult passage in the Bible, Rom. viii.\n21-24, must be interpreted in this sense.\n\nIn Buddhism also, there is no lack of expressions of this truth. For\nexample, when Buddha, still as Bodisatwa, has his horse saddled for the\nlast time, for his flight into the wilderness from his father’s house, he\nsays these lines to the horse: “Long hast thou existed in life and in\ndeath, but now thou shalt cease from carrying and drawing. Bear me but\nthis once more, O Kantakana, away from here, and when I have attained to\nthe Law (have become Buddha) I will not forget thee” (Foe Koue Ki, trad.\np. Abel Rémusat, p. 233).\n\nAsceticism then shows itself further in voluntary and intentional poverty,\nwhich not only arises _per accidens_, because the possessions are given\naway to mitigate the sufferings of others, but is here an end in itself,\nis meant to serve as a constant mortification of will, so that the\nsatisfaction of the wishes, the sweet of life, shall not again arouse the\nwill, against which self-knowledge has conceived a horror. He who has\nattained to this point, still always feels, as a living body, as concrete\nmanifestation of will, the natural disposition for every kind of volition;\nbut he intentionally suppresses it, for he compels himself to refrain from\ndoing all that he would like to do, and to do all that he would like not\nto do, even if this has no further end than that of serving as a\nmortification of will. Since he himself denies the will which appears in\nhis own person, he will not resist if another does the same, _i.e._,\ninflicts wrongs upon him. Therefore every suffering coming to him from\nwithout, through chance or the wickedness of others, is welcome to him,\nevery injury, ignominy, and insult; he receives them gladly as the\nopportunity of learning with certainty that he no longer asserts the will,\nbut gladly sides with every enemy of the manifestation of will which is\nhis own person. Therefore he bears such ignominy and suffering with\ninexhaustible patience and meekness, returns good for evil without\nostentation, and allows the fire of anger to rise within him just as\nlittle as that of the desires. And he mortifies not only the will itself,\nbut also its visible form, its objectivity, the body. He nourishes it\nsparingly, lest its excessive vigour and prosperity should animate and\nexcite more strongly the will, of which it is merely the expression and\nthe mirror. So he practises fasting, and even resorts to chastisement and\nself-inflicted torture, in order that, by constant privation and\nsuffering, he may more and more break down and destroy the will, which he\nrecognises and abhors as the source of his own suffering existence and\nthat of the world. If at last death comes, which puts an end to this\nmanifestation of that will, whose existence here has long since perished\nthrough free-denial of itself, with the exception of the weak residue of\nit which appears as the life of this body; it is most welcome, and is\ngladly received as a longed-for deliverance. Here it is not, as in the\ncase of others, merely the manifestation which ends with death; but the\ninner nature itself is abolished, which here existed only in the\nmanifestation, and that in a very weak degree;(84) this last slight bond\nis now broken. For him who thus ends, the world has ended also.\n\nAnd what I have here described with feeble tongue and only in general\nterms, is no philosophical fable, invented by myself, and only of to-day;\nno, it was the enviable life of so many saints and beautiful souls among\nChristians, and still more among Hindus and Buddhists, and also among the\nbelievers of other religions. However different were the dogmas impressed\non their reason, the same inward, direct, intuitive knowledge, from which\nalone all virtue and holiness proceed, expressed itself in precisely the\nsame way in the conduct of life. For here also the great distinction\nbetween intuitive and abstract knowledge shows itself; a distinction which\nis of such importance and universal application in our whole\ninvestigation, and which has hitherto been too little attended to. There\nis a wide gulf between the two, which can only be crossed by the aid of\nphilosophy, as regards the knowledge of the nature of the world.\nIntuitively or _in concreto_, every man is really conscious of all\nphilosophical truths, but to bring them to abstract knowledge, to\nreflection, is the work of philosophy, which neither ought nor is able to\ndo more than this.\n\nThus it may be that the inner nature of holiness, self-renunciation,\nmortification of our own will, asceticism, is here for the first time\nexpressed abstractly, and free from all mythical elements, as _denial of\nthe will to live_, appearing after the complete knowledge of its own\nnature has become a quieter of all volition. On the other hand, it has\nbeen known directly and realised in practice by saints and ascetics, who\nhad all the same inward knowledge, though they used very different\nlanguage with regard to it, according to the dogmas which their reason had\naccepted, and in consequence of which an Indian, a Christian, or a Lama\nsaint must each give a very different account of his conduct, which is,\nhowever, of no importance as regards the fact. A saint may be full of the\nabsurdest superstition, or, on the contrary, he may be a philosopher, it\nis all the same. His conduct alone certifies that he is a saint, for, in a\nmoral regard, it proceeds from knowledge of the world and its nature,\nwhich is not abstractly but intuitively and directly apprehended, and is\nonly expressed by him in any dogma for the satisfaction of his reason. It\nis therefore just as little needful that a saint should be a philosopher\nas that a philosopher should be a saint; just as it is not necessary that\na perfectly beautiful man should be a great sculptor, or that a great\nsculptor should himself be a beautiful man. In general, it is a strange\ndemand upon a moralist that he should teach no other virtue than that\nwhich he himself possesses. To repeat the whole nature of the world\nabstractly, universally, and distinctly in concepts, and thus to store up,\nas it were, a reflected image of it in permanent concepts always at the\ncommand of the reason; this and nothing else is philosophy. I refer the\nreader to the passage quoted from Bacon in the First Book.\n\nBut the description I have given above of the denial of the will to live,\nof the conduct of a beautiful soul, of a resigned and voluntarily\nexpiating saint, is merely abstract and general, and therefore cold. As\nthe knowledge from which the denial of the will proceeds is intuitive and\nnot abstract, it finds its most perfect expression, not in abstract\nconceptions, but in deeds and conduct. Therefore, in order to understand\nfully what we philosophically express as denial of the will to live, one\nmust come to know examples of it in experience and actual life. Certainly\nthey are not to be met with in daily experience: _Nam omnia præclara tam\ndifficilia quam rara sunt_, Spinoza admirably says. Therefore, unless by a\nspecially happy fate we are made eye-witnesses, we have to content\nourselves with descriptions of the lives of such men. Indian literature,\nas we see from the little that we as yet know through translations, is\nvery rich in descriptions of the lives of saints, penitents, Samanas or\nascetics, Sannyâsis or mendicants, and whatever else they may be called.\nEven the well-known “Mythologie des Indous, par Mad. de Polier,” though by\nno means to be commended in every respect, contains many excellent\nexamples of this kind (especially in ch. 13, vol. ii.) Among Christians\nalso there is no lack of examples which afford us the illustrations we\ndesire. See the biographies, for the most part badly written, of those\npersons who are sometimes called saintly souls, sometimes pietists,\nquietists, devout enthusiasts, and so forth. Collections of such\nbiographies have been made at various times, such as Tersteegen’s “Leben\nheiliger Seelen,” Reiz’s “Geschichte der Wiedergeborennen,” in our own\nday, a collection by Kanne, which, with much that is bad, yet contains\nsome good, and especially the “Leben der Beata Sturmin.” To this category\nvery properly belongs the life of St. Francis of Assisi, that true\npersonification of the ascetic, and prototype of all mendicant friars. His\nlife, described by his younger contemporary, St. Bonaventura, also famous\nas a scholastic, has recently been republished. “Vita S. Francisci a S.\nBonaventura concinnata” (Soest, 1847), though shortly before a painstaking\nand detailed biography, making use of all sources of information, appeared\nin France, “Histoire de S. François d’Assise, par Chavin de Mallan”\n(1845). As an Oriental parallel of these monastic writings we have the\nvery valuable work of Spence Hardy, “Eastern Monachism; an Account of the\nOrder of Mendicants founded by Gotama Budha” (1850). It shows us the same\nthing in another dress. We also see what a matter of indifference it is\nwhether it proceeds from a theistical or an atheistical religion. But as a\nspecial and exceedingly full example and practical illustration of the\nconceptions I have established, I can thoroughly recommend the\n“Autobiography of Madame de Guion.” To become acquainted with this great\nand beautiful soul, the very thought of whom always fills me with\nreverence, and to do justice to the excellence of her disposition while\nmaking allowance for the superstition of her reason, must be just as\ndelightful to every man of the better sort as with vulgar thinkers,\n_i.e._, the majority, that book will always stand in bad repute. For it is\nthe case with regard to everything, that each man can only prize that\nwhich to a certain extent is analogous to him and for which he has at\nleast a slight inclination. This holds good of ethical concerns as well as\nof intellectual. We might to a certain extent regard the well-known French\nbiography of Spinoza as a case in point, if we used as a key to it that\nnoble introduction to his very insufficient essay, “De Emendatione\nIntellectus,” a passage which I can also recommend as the most effectual\nmeans I know of stilling the storm of the passions. Finally, even the\ngreat Goethe, Greek as he is, did not think it below his dignity to show\nus this most beautiful side of humanity in the magic mirror of poetic art,\nfor he represented the life of Fräulein Klettenberg in an idealised form\nin his “Confessions of a Beautiful Soul,” and later, in his own biography,\ngave us also an historical account of it. Besides this, he twice told the\nstory of the life of St. Philippo Neri. The history of the world, will,\nand indeed must, keep silence about the men whose conduct is the best and\nonly adequate illustration of this important point of our investigation,\nfor the material of the history of the world is quite different, and\nindeed opposed to this. It is not the denial of the will to live, but its\nassertion and its manifestation in innumerable individuals in which its\nconflict with itself at the highest grade of its objectification appears\nwith perfect distinctness, and brings before our eyes, now the ascendancy\nof the individual through prudence, now the might of the many through\ntheir mass, now the might of chance personified as fate, always the vanity\nand emptiness of the whole effort. We, however, do not follow here the\ncourse of phenomena in time, but, as philosophers, we seek to investigate\nthe ethical significance of action, and take this as the only criterion of\nwhat for us is significant and important. Thus we will not be withheld by\nany fear of the constant numerical superiority of vulgarity and dulness\nfrom acknowledging that the greatest, most important, and most significant\nphenomenon that the world can show is not the conqueror of the world, but\nthe subduer of it; is nothing but the quiet, unobserved life of a man who\nhas attained to the knowledge in consequence of which he surrenders and\ndenies that will to live which fills everything and strives and strains in\nall, and which first gains freedom here in him alone, so that his conduct\nbecomes the exact opposite of that of other men. In this respect,\ntherefore, for the philosopher, these accounts of the lives of holy,\nself-denying men, badly as they are generally written, and mixed as they\nare with superstition and nonsense, are, because of the significance of\nthe material, immeasurably more instructive and important than even\nPlutarch and Livy.\n\nIt will further assist us much in obtaining a more definite and full\nknowledge of what we have expressed abstractly and generally, according to\nour method of exposition, as the denial of the will to live, if we\nconsider the moral teaching that has been imparted with this intention,\nand by men who were full of this spirit; and this will also show how old\nour view is, though the pure philosophical expression of it may be quite\nnew. The teaching of this kind which lies nearest to hand is Christianity,\nthe ethics of which are entirely in the spirit indicated, and lead not\nonly to the highest degrees of human love, but also to renunciation. The\ngerm of this last side of it is certainly distinctly present in the\nwritings of the Apostles, but it was only fully developed and expressed\nlater. We find the Apostles enjoining the love of our neighbour as\nourselves, benevolence, the requital of hatred with love and well-doing,\npatience, meekness, the endurance of all possible injuries without\nresistance, abstemiousness in nourishment to keep down lust, resistance to\nsensual desire, if possible, altogether. We already see here the first\ndegrees of asceticism, or denial of the will proper. This last expression\ndenotes that which in the Gospels is called denying ourselves and taking\nup the cross (Matt. xvi. 24, 25; Mark viii. 34, 35; Luke ix. 23, 24, xiv.\n26, 27, 33). This tendency soon developed itself more and more, and was\nthe origin of hermits, anchorites, and monasticism—an origin which in\nitself was pure and holy, but for that very reason unsuitable for the\ngreat majority of men; therefore what developed out of it could only be\nhypocrisy and wickedness, for _abusus optimi pessimus_. In more developed\nChristianity, we see that seed of asceticism unfold into the full flower\nin the writings of the Christian saints and mystics. These preach, besides\nthe purest love, complete resignation, voluntary and absolute poverty,\ngenuine calmness, perfect indifference to all worldly things, dying to our\nown will and being born again in God, entire forgetting of our own person,\nand sinking ourselves in the contemplation of God. A full exposition of\nthis will be found in Fénélon’s “Explication des Maximes des Saints sur la\nVie Interieure.” But the spirit of this development of Christianity is\ncertainly nowhere so fully and powerfully expressed as in the writings of\nthe German mystics, in the works of Meister Eckhard, and in that justly\nfamous book “Die Deutsche Theologie,” of which Luther says in the\nintroduction to it which he wrote, that with the exception of the Bible\nand St. Augustine, he had learnt more from it of what God, Christ, and man\nare than from any other book. Yet we only got the genuine and correct text\nof it in the year 1851, in the Stuttgart edition by Pfeiffer. The precepts\nand doctrines which are laid down there are the most perfect exposition,\nsprung from deep inward conviction of what I have presented as the denial\nof the will. It should therefore be studied more closely in that form\nbefore it is dogmatised about with Jewish-Protestant assurance. Tauler’s\n“Nachfolgung des armen Leben Christi,” and also his “Medulla Animæ,” are\nwritten in the same admirable spirit, though not quite equal in value to\nthat work. In my opinion the teaching of these genuine Christian mystics,\nwhen compared with the teaching of the New Testament, is as alcohol to\nwine, or what becomes visible in the New Testament as through a veil and\nmist appears to us in the works of the mystics without cloak or disguise,\nin full clearness and distinctness. Finally, the New Testament might be\nregarded as the first initiation, the mystics as the second,—σμικρα και\nμεγαλα μυστηρια.\n\nWe find, however, that which we have called the denial of the will to live\nmore fully developed, more variously expressed, and more vividly\nrepresented in the ancient Sanscrit writings than could be the case in the\nChristian Church and the Western world. That this important ethical view\nof life could here attain to a fuller development and a more distinct\nexpression is perhaps principally to be ascribed to the fact that it was\nnot confined by an element quite foreign to it, as Christianity is by the\nJewish theology, to which its sublime author had necessarily to adopt and\naccommodate it, partly consciously, partly, it may be, unconsciously. Thus\nChristianity is made up of two very different constituent parts, and I\nshould like to call the purely ethical part especially and indeed\nexclusively Christian, and distinguish it from the Jewish dogmatism with\nwhich it is combined. If, as has often been feared, and especially at the\npresent time, that excellent and salutary religion should altogether\ndecline, I should look for the reason of this simply in the fact that it\ndoes not consist of one single element, but of two originally different\nelements, which have only been combined through the accident of history.\nIn such a case dissolution had to follow through the separation of these\nelements, arising from their different relationship to and reaction\nagainst the progressive spirit of the age. But even after this dissolution\nthe purely ethical part must always remain uninjured, because it is\nindestructible. Our knowledge of Hindu literature is still very imperfect.\nYet, as we find their ethical teaching variously and powerfully expressed\nin the Vedas, Puranas, poems, myths, legends of their saints, maxims and\nprecepts,(85) we see that it inculcates love of our neighbour with\ncomplete renunciation of self-love; love generally, not confined to\nmankind, but including all living creatures; benevolence, even to the\ngiving away of the hard-won wages of daily toil; unlimited patience\ntowards all who injure us; the requital of all wickedness, however base,\nwith goodness and love; voluntary and glad endurance of all ignominy;\nabstinence from all animal food; perfect chastity and renunciation of all\nsensual pleasure for him who strives after true holiness; the surrender of\nall possessions, the forsaking of every dwelling-place and of all\nrelatives; deep unbroken solitude, spent in silent contemplation, with\nvoluntary penance and terrible slow self-torture for the absolute\nmortification of the will, torture which extends to voluntary death by\nstarvation, or by men giving themselves up to crocodiles, or flinging\nthemselves over the sacred precipice in the Himalayas, or being buried\nalive, or, finally, by flinging themselves under the wheels of the huge\ncar of an idol drawn along amid the singing, shouting, and dancing of\nbayaderes. And even yet these precepts, whose origin reaches back more\nthan four thousand years, are carried out in practice, in some cases even\nto the utmost extreme,(86) and this notwithstanding the fact that the\nHindu nation has been broken up into so many parts. A religion which\ndemands the greatest sacrifices, and which has yet remained so long in\npractice in a nation that embraces so many millions of persons, cannot be\nan arbitrarily invented superstition, but must have its foundation in the\nnature of man. But besides this, if we read the life of a Christian\npenitent or saint, and also that of a Hindu saint, we cannot sufficiently\nwonder at the harmony we find between them. In the case of such radically\ndifferent dogmas, customs, and circumstances, the inward life and effort\nof both is the same. And the same harmony prevails in the maxims\nprescribed for both of them. For example, Tauler speaks of the absolute\npoverty which one ought to seek, and which consists in giving away and\ndivesting oneself completely of everything from which one might draw\ncomfort or worldly pleasure, clearly because all this constantly affords\nnew nourishment to the will, which it is intended to destroy entirely. And\nas an Indian counterpart of this, we find in the precepts of Fo that the\nSaniassi, who ought to be without a dwelling and entirely without\nproperty, is further finally enjoined not to lay himself down often under\nthe same tree, lest he should acquire a preference or inclination for it\nabove other trees. The Christian mystic and the teacher of the Vedanta\nphilosophy agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works\nand religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to\nperfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and\nnations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as\noptimistic dulness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the\nmind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely\nbecause of its excellence.\n\nI have now indicated the sources from which there may be obtained a direct\nknowledge, drawn from life itself, of the phenomena in which the denial of\nthe will to live exhibits itself. In some respects this is the most\nimportant point of our whole work; yet I have only explained it quite\ngenerally, for it is better to refer to those who speak from direct\nexperience, than to increase the size of this book unduly by weak\nrepetitions of what is said by them.\n\nI only wish to add a little to the general indication of the nature of\nthis state. We saw above that the wicked man, by the vehemence of his\nvolition, suffers constant, consuming, inward pain, and finally, if all\nobjects of volition are exhausted, quenches the fiery thirst of his\nself-will by the sight of the suffering of others. He, on the contrary,\nwho has attained to the denial of the will to live, however poor, joyless,\nand full of privation his condition may appear when looked at externally,\nis yet filled with inward joy and the true peace of heaven. It is not the\nrestless strain of life, the jubilant delight which has keen suffering as\nits preceding or succeeding condition, in the experience of the man who\nloves life; but it is a peace that cannot be shaken, a deep rest and\ninward serenity, a state which we cannot behold without the greatest\nlonging when it is brought before our eyes or our imagination, because we\nat once recognise it as that which alone is right, infinitely surpassing\neverything else, upon which our better self cries within us the great\n_sapere aude_. Then we feel that every gratification of our wishes won\nfrom the world is merely like the alms which the beggar receives from life\nto-day that he may hunger again on the morrow; resignation, on the\ncontrary, is like an inherited estate, it frees the owner for ever from\nall care.\n\nIt will be remembered from the Third Book that the æsthetic pleasure in\nthe beautiful consists in great measure in the fact that in entering the\nstate of pure contemplation we are lifted for the moment above all\nwilling, _i.e._, all wishes and cares; we become, as it were, freed from\nourselves. We are no longer the individual whose knowledge is subordinated\nto the service of its constant willing, the correlative of the particular\nthing to which objects are motives, but the eternal subject of knowing\npurified from will, the correlative of the Platonic Idea. And we know that\nthese moments in which, delivered from the ardent strain of will, we seem\nto rise out of the heavy atmosphere of earth, are the happiest which we\nexperience. From this we can understand how blessed the life of a man must\nbe whose will is silenced, not merely for a moment, as in the enjoyment of\nthe beautiful, but for ever, indeed altogether extinguished, except as\nregards the last glimmering spark that retains the body in life, and will\nbe extinguished with its death. Such a man, who, after many bitter\nstruggles with his own nature, has finally conquered entirely, continues\nto exist only as a pure, knowing being, the undimmed mirror of the world.\nNothing can trouble him more, nothing can move him, for he has cut all the\nthousand cords of will which hold us bound to the world, and, as desire,\nfear, envy, anger, drag us hither and thither in constant pain. He now\nlooks back smiling and at rest on the delusions of this world, which once\nwere able to move and agonise his spirit also, but which now stand before\nhim as utterly indifferent to him, as the chess-men when the game is\nended, or as, in the morning, the cast-off masquerading dress which\nworried and disquieted us in a night in Carnival. Life and its forms now\npass before him as a fleeting illusion, as a light morning dream before\nhalf-waking eyes, the real world already shining through it so that it can\nno longer deceive; and like this morning dream, they finally vanish\naltogether without any violent transition. From this we can understand the\nmeaning of Madame Guion when towards the end of her autobiography she\noften expresses herself thus: “Everything is alike to me; I _cannot_ will\nanything more: often I know not whether I exist or not.” In order to\nexpress how, after the extinction of the will, the death of the body\n(which is indeed only the manifestation of the will, and therefore loses\nall significance when the will is abolished) can no longer have any\nbitterness, but is very welcome, I may be allowed to quote the words of\nthat holy penitent, although they are not very elegantly turned: “_Midi de\nla gloire; jour où il n’y a plus de nuit; vie qui ne craint plus la mort,\ndans la mort même: parceque la mort a vaincu la mort, et que celui qui a\nsouffert la première mort, ne goutera plus la seconde mort_” (Vie de Mad.\nde Guion, vol. ii. p. 13).\n\nWe must not, however, suppose that when, by means of the knowledge which\nacts as a quieter of will, the denial of the will to live has once\nappeared, it never wavers or vacillates, and that we can rest upon it as\non an assured possession. Rather, it must ever anew be attained by a\nconstant battle. For since the body is the will itself only in the form of\nobjectivity or as manifestation in the world as idea, so long as the body\nlives, the whole will to live exists potentially, and constantly strives\nto become actual, and to burn again with all its ardour. Therefore that\npeace and blessedness in the life of holy men which we have described is\nonly found as the flower which proceeds from the constant victory over the\nwill, and the ground in which it grows is the constant battle with the\nwill to live, for no one can have lasting peace upon earth. We therefore\nsee the histories of the inner life of saints full of spiritual conflicts,\ntemptations, and absence of grace, _i.e._, the kind of knowledge which\nmakes all motives ineffectual, and as an universal quieter silences all\nvolition, gives the deepest peace and opens the door of freedom. Therefore\nalso we see those who have once attained to the denial of the will to live\nstrive with all their might to keep upon this path, by enforced\nrenunciation of every kind, by penance and severity of life, and by\nselecting whatever is disagreeable to them, all in order to suppress the\nwill, which is constantly springing up anew. Hence, finally, because they\nalready know the value of salvation, their anxious carefulness to retain\nthe hard-won blessing, their scruples of conscience about every innocent\npleasure, or about every little excitement of their vanity, which here\nalso dies last, the most immovable, the most active, and the most foolish\nof all the inclinations of man. By the term _asceticism_, which I have\nused so often, I mean in its narrower sense this _intentional_ breaking of\nthe will by the refusal of what is agreeable and the selection of what is\ndisagreeable, the voluntarily chosen life of penance and self-chastisement\nfor the continual mortification of the will.\n\nWe see this practised by him who has attained to the denial of the will in\norder to enable him to persist in it; but suffering in general, as it is\ninflicted by fate, is a second way (δευτερος πλους(87)) of attaining to\nthat denial. Indeed, we may assume that most men only attain to it in this\nway, and that it is the suffering which is personally experienced, not\nthat which is merely known, which most frequently produces complete\nresignation, often only at the approach of death. For only in the case of\na few is the mere knowledge which, seeing through the _principium\nindividuationis_, first produces perfect goodness of disposition and\nuniversal love of humanity, and finally enables them to regard all the\nsuffering of the world as their own; only in the case of a few, I say, is\nthis knowledge sufficient to bring about the denial of the will. Even with\nhim who approaches this point, it is almost invariably the case that the\ntolerable condition of his own body, the flattery of the moment, the\ndelusion of hope, and the satisfaction of the will, which is ever\npresenting itself anew, _i.e._, lust, is a constant hindrance to the\ndenial of the will, and a constant temptation to the renewed assertion of\nit. Therefore in this respect all these illusions have been personified as\nthe devil. Thus in most cases the will must be broken by great personal\nsuffering before its self-conquest appears. Then we see the man who has\npassed through all the increasing degrees of affliction with the most\nvehement resistance, and is finally brought to the verge of despair,\nsuddenly retire into himself, know himself and the world, change his whole\nnature, rise above himself and all suffering, as if purified and\nsanctified by it, in inviolable peace, blessedness, and sublimity,\nwillingly renounce everything he previously desired with all his might,\nand joyfully embrace death. It is the refined silver of the denial of the\nwill to live that suddenly comes forth from the purifying flame of\nsuffering. It is salvation. Sometimes we see even those who were very\nwicked purified to this degree by great grief; they have become new beings\nand are completely changed. Therefore their former misdeeds trouble their\nconsciences no more, yet they willingly atone for them by death, and\ngladly see the end of the manifestation of that will which is now foreign\nto them and abhorred by them. The great Goethe has given us a distinct and\nvisible representation of this denial of the will, brought about by great\nmisfortunes and despair of all deliverance, in his immortal masterpiece\n“Faust,” in the story of the sufferings of Gretchen. I know no parallel to\nthis in poetry. It is a perfect example of the second path that leads to\nthe denial of the will, not, as the first, through the mere knowledge of\nthe sufferings of a whole world which one has voluntarily acquired, but\nthrough excessive suffering experienced in one’s own person. Many\ntragedies certainly end by conducting their strong-willed heroes to the\npoint of entire resignation, and then generally the will to live and its\nmanifestation end together, but no representation that is known to me\nbrings what is essential to that change so distinctly before us, free from\nall that is extraneous, as the part of “Faust” I have referred to.\n\nIn actual life we see that those unfortunate persons who have to drink to\nthe dregs the greatest cup of suffering, since when all hope is taken from\nthem they have to face with full consciousness a shameful, violent, and\noften painful death on the scaffold, are very frequently changed in this\nway. We must not indeed assume that there is so great a difference between\ntheir character and that of most men as their fate would seem to indicate,\nbut must attribute the latter for the most part to circumstances; yet they\nare guilty and to a considerable degree bad. We see, however, many of\nthem, when they have entirely lost hope, changed in the way referred to.\nThey now show actual goodness and purity of disposition, true abhorrence\nof doing any act in the least degree bad or unkind. They forgive their\nenemies, even if it is through them that they innocently suffer; and not\nwith words merely and a sort of hypocritical fear of the judges of the\nlower world, but in reality and with inward earnestness and no desire for\nrevenge. Indeed, their sufferings and death at last becomes dear to them,\nfor the denial of the will to live has appeared; they often decline the\ndeliverance when it is offered, and die gladly, peacefully, and happily.\nTo them the last secret of life has revealed itself in their excessive\npain; the secret that misery and wickedness, sorrow and hate, the sufferer\nand the inflicter of suffering, however different they may appear to the\nknowledge which follows the principle of sufficient reason, are in\nthemselves one, the manifestation of that one will to live which\nobjectifies its conflict with itself by means of the _principium\nindividuationis_. They have learned to know both sides in full measure,\nthe badness and the misery; and since at last they see the identity of the\ntwo, they reject them both at once; they deny the will to live. In what\nmyths and dogmas they account to their reason for this intuitive and\ndirect knowledge and for their own change is, as has been said, a matter\nof no importance.\n\nMatthias Claudius must without doubt have witnessed a change of mind of\nthis description when he wrote the remarkable essay in the “Wandsbecker\nBoten” (pt. i. p. 115) with the title “Bekehrungsgeschichte des ***”\n(“History of the Conversion of ***”), which concludes thus: “Man’s way of\nthinking may pass from one point of the periphery to the opposite point,\nand again back to the former point, if circumstances mark out for him the\npath. And these changes in a man are really nothing great or interesting,\nbut that _remarkable, catholic, transcendental change_ in which the whole\ncircle is irreparably broken up and all the laws of psychology become vain\nand empty when the coat is stripped from the shoulders, or at least turned\noutside in, and as it were scales fall from a man’s eyes, is such that\nevery one who has breath in his nostrils forsakes father and mother if he\ncan hear or experience something certain about it.”\n\nThe approach of death and hopelessness are in other respects not\nabsolutely necessary for such a purification through suffering. Even\nwithout them the knowledge of the contradiction of the will to live with\nitself can, through great misfortune and pain, force an entrance, and the\nvanity of all striving become recognised. Hence it has often happened that\nmen who have led a very restless life in the full strain of the passions,\nkings, heroes, and adventurers, suddenly change, betake themselves to\nresignation and penance, become hermits or monks. To this class belong all\ntrue accounts of conversions; for example, that of Raymond Lully, who had\nlong wooed a fair lady, and was at last admitted to her chamber,\nanticipating the fulfilment of all his wishes, when she, opening her\nbodice, showed him her bosom frightfully eaten with cancer. From that\nmoment, as if he had looked into hell, he was changed; he forsook the\ncourt of the king of Majorca, and went into the desert to do penance.(88)\nThis conversion is very like that of the Abbé Rancé, which I have briefly\nrelated in the 48th chapter of the Supplement. If we consider how in both\ncases the transition from the pleasure to the horror of life was the\noccasion of it, this throws some light upon the remarkable fact that it is\namong the French, the most cheerful, gay, sensuous, and frivolous nation\nin Europe, that by far the strictest of all monastic orders, the\nTrappists, arose, was re-established by Rancé after its fall, and has\nmaintained itself to the present day in all its purity and strictness, in\nspite of revolutions, Church reformations, and encroachments of\ninfidelity.\n\nBut a knowledge such as that referred to above of the nature of this\nexistence may leave us again along with the occasion of it and the will to\nlive, and with it the previous character may reappear. Thus we see that\nthe passionate Benvenuto Cellini was changed in this way, once when he was\nin prison, and again when very ill; but when the suffering passed over, he\nfell back again into his old state. In general, the denial of the will to\nlive by no means proceeds from suffering with the necessity of an effect\nfrom its cause, but the will remains free; for this is indeed the one\npoint at which its freedom appears directly in the phenomenon; hence the\nastonishment which Asmus expresses so strongly at the “transcendental\nchange.” In the case of every suffering, it is always possible to conceive\na will which exceeds it in intensity and is therefore unconquered by it.\nThus Plato speaks in the “Phædon” of men who up to the moment of their\nexecution feast, drink, and indulge in sensuous pleasure, asserting life\neven to the death. Shakespeare shows us in Cardinal Beaufort the fearful\nend of a profligate, who dies full of despair, for no suffering or death\ncan break his will, which is vehement to the extreme of wickedness.(89)\n\nThe more intense the will is, the more glaring is the conflict of its\nmanifestation, and thus the greater is the suffering. A world which was\nthe manifestation of a far more intense will to live than this world\nmanifests would produce so much the greater suffering; would thus be a\nhell.\n\nAll suffering, since it is a mortification and a call to resignation, has\npotentially a sanctifying power. This is the explanation of the fact that\nevery great misfortune or deep pain inspires a certain awe. But the\nsufferer only really becomes an object of reverence when, surveying the\ncourse of his life as a chain of sorrows, or mourning some great and\nincurable misfortune, he does not really look at the special combination\nof circumstances which has plunged his own life into suffering, nor stops\nat the single great misfortune that has befallen him; for in so doing his\nknowledge still follows the principle of sufficient reason, and clings to\nthe particular phenomenon; he still wills life only not under the\nconditions which have happened to him; but only then, I say, he is truly\nworthy of reverence when he raises his glance from the particular to the\nuniversal, when he regards his suffering as merely an example of the\nwhole, and for him, since in a moral regard he partakes of genius, one\ncase stands for a thousand, so that the whole of life conceived as\nessentially suffering brings him to resignation. Therefore it inspires\nreverence when in Goethe’s “Torquato Tasso” the princess speaks of how her\nown life and that of her relations has always been sad and joyless, and\nyet regards the matter from an entirely universal point of view.\n\nA very noble character we always imagine with a certain trace of quiet\nsadness, which is anything but a constant fretfulness at daily annoyances\n(this would be an ignoble trait, and lead us to fear a bad disposition),\nbut is a consciousness derived from knowledge of the vanity of all\npossessions, of the suffering of all life, not merely of his own. But such\nknowledge may primarily be awakened by the personal experience of\nsuffering, especially some one great sorrow, as a single unfulfilled wish\nbrought Petrarch to that state of resigned sadness concerning the whole of\nlife which appeals to us so pathetically in his works; for the Daphne he\npursued had to flee from his hands in order to leave him, instead of\nherself, the immortal laurel. When through some such great and irrevocable\ndenial of fate the will is to some extent broken, almost nothing else is\ndesired, and the character shows itself mild, just, noble, and resigned.\nWhen, finally, grief has no definite object, but extends itself over the\nwhole of life, then it is to a certain extent a going into itself, a\nwithdrawal, a gradual disappearance of the will, whose visible\nmanifestation, the body, it imperceptibly but surely undermines, so that a\nman feels a certain loosening of his bonds, a mild foretaste of that death\nwhich promises to be the abolition at once of the body and of the will.\nTherefore a secret pleasure accompanies this grief, and it is this, as I\nbelieve, which the most melancholy of all nations has called “the joy of\ngrief.” But here also lies the danger of _sentimentality_, both in life\nitself and in the representation of it in poetry; when a man is always\nmourning and lamenting without courageously rising to resignation. In this\nway we lose both earth and heaven, and retain merely a watery\nsentimentality. Only if suffering assumes the form of pure knowledge, and\nthis, acting as a _quieter of the will_, brings about resignation, is it\nworthy of reverence. In this regard, however, we feel a certain respect at\nthe sight of every great sufferer which is akin to the feeling excited by\nvirtue and nobility of character, and also seems like a reproach of our\nown happy condition. We cannot help regarding every sorrow, both our own\nand those of others, as at least a potential advance towards virtue and\nholiness, and, on the contrary, pleasures and worldly satisfactions as a\nretrogression from them. This goes so far, that every man who endures a\ngreat bodily or mental suffering, indeed every one who merely performs\nsome physical labour which demands the greatest exertion, in the sweat of\nhis brow and with evident exhaustion, yet with patience and without\nmurmuring, every such man, I say, if we consider him with close attention,\nappears to us like a sick man who tries a painful cure, and who willingly,\nand even with satisfaction, endures the suffering it causes him, because\nhe knows that the more he suffers the more the cause of his disease is\naffected, and that therefore the present suffering is the measure of his\ncure.\n\nAccording to what has been said, the denial of the will to live, which is\njust what is called absolute, entire resignation, or holiness, always\nproceeds from that quieter of the will which the knowledge of its inner\nconflict and essential vanity, expressing themselves in the suffering of\nall living things, becomes. The difference, which we have represented as\ntwo paths, consists in whether that knowledge is called up by suffering\nwhich is merely and purely _known_, and is freely appropriated by means of\nthe penetration of the _principium individuationis_, or by suffering which\nis directly _felt_ by a man himself. True salvation, deliverance from life\nand suffering, cannot even be imagined without complete denial of the\nwill. Till then, every one is simply this will itself, whose manifestation\nis an ephemeral existence, a constantly vain and empty striving, and the\nworld full of suffering we have represented, to which all irrevocably and\nin like manner belong. For we found above that life is always assured to\nthe will to live, and its one real form is the present, from which they\ncan never escape, since birth and death reign in the phenomenal world. The\nIndian mythus expresses this by saying “they are born again.” The great\nethical difference of character means this, that the bad man is infinitely\nfar from the attainment of the knowledge from which the denial of the will\nproceeds, and therefore he is in truth _actually_ exposed to all the\nmiseries which appear in life as _possible_; for even the present\nfortunate condition of his personality is merely a phenomenon produced by\nthe _principium individuationis_, and a delusion of Mâyâ, the happy dream\nof a beggar. The sufferings which in the vehemence and ardour of his will\nhe inflicts upon others are the measure of the suffering, the experience\nof which in his own person cannot break his will, and plainly lead it to\nthe denial of itself. All true and pure love, on the other hand, and even\nall free justice, proceed from the penetration of the _principium\nindividuationis_, which, if it appears with its full power, results in\nperfect sanctification and salvation, the phenomenon of which is the state\nof resignation described above, the unbroken peace which accompanies it,\nand the greatest delight in death.(90)",

    "page_content": "will, differs most widely from the denial of the will to live, which is\nthe single outstanding act of free-will in the manifestation, and is\ntherefore, as Asmus calls it, the transcendental change. This last has\nbeen fully considered in the course of our work. Far from being denial of\nthe will, suicide is a phenomenon of strong assertion of will; for the\nessence of negation lies in this, that the joys of life are shunned, not\nits sorrows. The suicide wills life, and is only dissatisfied with the\nconditions under which it has presented itself to him. He therefore by no\nmeans surrenders the will to live, but only life, in that he destroys the\nindividual manifestation. He wills life—wills the unrestricted existence\nand assertion of the body; but the complication of circumstances does not\nallow this, and there results for him great suffering. The very will to\nlive finds itself so much hampered in this particular manifestation that\nit cannot put forth its energies. It therefore comes to such a\ndetermination as is in conformity with its own nature, which lies outside\nthe conditions of the principle of sufficient reason, and to which,\ntherefore, all particular manifestations are alike indifferent, inasmuch\nas it itself remains unaffected by all appearing and passing away, and is\nthe inner life of all things; for that firm inward assurance by reason of\nwhich we all live free from the constant dread of death, the assurance\nthat a phenomenal existence can never be wanting to the will, supports our\naction even in the case of suicide. Thus the will to live appears just as\nmuch in suicide (Siva) as in the satisfaction of self-preservation\n(Vishnu) and in the sensual pleasure of procreation (Brahma). This is the\ninner meaning of the unity of the Trimurtis, which is embodied in its\nentirety in every human being, though in time it raises now one, now\nanother, of its three heads. Suicide stands in the same relation to the\ndenial of the will as the individual thing does to the Idea. The suicide\ndenies only the individual, not the species. We have already seen that as\nlife is always assured to the will to live, and as sorrow is inseparable\nfrom life, suicide, the wilful destruction of the single phenomenal\nexistence, is a vain and foolish act; for the thing-in-itself remains\nunaffected by it, even as the rainbow endures however fast the drops which\nsupport it for the moment may change. But, more than this, it is also the\nmasterpiece of Mâyâ, as the most flagrant example of the contradiction of\nthe will to live with itself. As we found this contradiction in the case\nof the lowest manifestations of will, in the permanent struggle of all the\nforces of nature, and of all organic individuals for matter and time and\nspace; and as we saw this antagonism come ever more to the front with\nterrible distinctness in the ascending grades of the objectification of\nthe will, so at last in the highest grade, the Idea of man, it reaches the\npoint at which, not only the individuals which express the same Idea\nextirpate each other, but even the same individual declares war against\nitself. The vehemence with which it wills life, and revolts against what\nhinders it, namely, suffering, brings it to the point of destroying\nitself; so that the individual will, by its own act, puts an end to that\nbody which is merely its particular visible expression, rather than permit\nsuffering to break the will. Just because the suicide cannot give up\nwilling, he gives up living. The will asserts itself here even in putting\nan end to its own manifestation, because it can no longer assert itself\notherwise. As, however, it was just the suffering which it so shuns that\nwas able, as mortification of the will, to bring it to the denial of\nitself, and hence to freedom, so in this respect the suicide is like a\nsick man, who, after a painful operation which would entirely cure him has\nbeen begun, will not allow it to be completed, but prefers to retain his\ndisease. Suffering approaches and reveals itself as the possibility of the\ndenial of will; but the will rejects it, in that it destroys the body, the\nmanifestation of itself, in order that it may remain unbroken. This is the\nreason why almost all ethical teachers, whether philosophical or\nreligious, condemn suicide, although they themselves can only give\nfar-fetched sophistical reasons for their opinion. But if a human being\nwas ever restrained from committing suicide by purely moral motives, the\ninmost meaning of this self-conquest (in whatever ideas his reason may\nhave clothed it) was this: “I will not shun suffering, in order that it\nmay help to put an end to the will to live, whose manifestation is so\nwretched, by so strengthening the knowledge of the real nature of the\nworld which is already beginning to dawn upon me, that it may become the\nfinal quieter of my will, and may free me for ever.”\n\nIt is well known that from time to time cases occur in which the act of\nsuicide extends to the children. The father first kills the children he\nloves, and then himself. Now, if we consider that conscience, religion,\nand all influencing ideas teach him to look upon murder as the greatest of\ncrimes, and that, in spite of this, he yet commits it, in the hour of his\nown death, and when he is altogether uninfluenced by any egotistical\nmotive, such a deed can only be explained in the following manner: in this\ncase, the will of the individual, the father, recognises itself\nimmediately in the children, though involved in the delusion of mistaking\nthe appearance for the true nature; and as he is at the same time deeply\nimpressed with the knowledge of the misery of all life, he now thinks to\nput an end to the inner nature itself, along with the appearance, and thus\nseeks to deliver from existence and its misery both himself and his\nchildren, in whom he discerns himself as living again. It would be an\nerror precisely analogous to this to suppose that one may reach the same\nend as is attained through voluntary chastity by frustrating the aim of\nnature in fecundation; or indeed if, in consideration of the unendurable\nsuffering of life, parents were to use means for the destruction of their\nnew-born children, instead of doing everything possible to ensure life to\nthat which is struggling into it. For if the will to live is there, as it\nis the only metaphysical reality, or the thing-in-itself, no physical\nforce can break it, but can only destroy its manifestation at this place\nand time. It itself can never be transcended except through knowledge.\nThus the only way of salvation is, that the will shall manifest itself\nunrestrictedly, in order that in this individual manifestation it may come\nto apprehend its own nature. Only as the result of this knowledge can the\nwill transcend itself, and thereby end the suffering which is inseparable\nfrom its manifestation. It is quite impossible to accomplish this end by\nphysical force, as by destroying the germ, or by killing the new-born\nchild, or by committing suicide. Nature guides the will to the light, just\nbecause it is only in the light that it can work out its salvation.\nTherefore the aims of Nature are to be promoted in every way as soon as\nthe will to live, which is its inner being, has determined itself.\n\nThere is a species of suicide which seems to be quite distinct from the\ncommon kind, though its occurrence has perhaps not yet been fully\nestablished. It is starvation, voluntarily chosen on the ground of extreme\nasceticism. All instances of it, however, have been accompanied and\nobscured by much religious fanaticism, and even superstition. Yet it seems\nthat the absolute denial of will may reach the point at which the will\nshall be wanting to take the necessary nourishment for the support of the\nnatural life. This kind of suicide is so far from being the result of the\nwill to live, that such a completely resigned ascetic only ceases to live\nbecause he has already altogether ceased to will. No other death than that\nby starvation is in this case conceivable (unless it were the result of\nsome special superstition); for the intention to cut short the torment\nwould itself be a stage in the assertion of will. The dogmas which satisfy\nthe reason of such a penitent delude him with the idea that a being of a\nhigher nature has inculcated the fasting to which his own inner tendency\ndrives him. Old examples of this may be found in the “Breslauer Sammlung\nvon Natur- und Medicin-Geschichten,” September 1799, p. 363; in Bayle’s\n“Nouvelles de la République des Lettres,” February 1685, p. 189; in\nZimmermann, “Ueber die Einsamkeit,” vol. i. p. 182; in the “Histoire de\nl’Académie des Sciences” for 1764, an account by Houttuyn, which is quoted\nin the “Sammlung für praktische Aerzte,” vol. i. p. 69. More recent\naccounts may be found in Hufeland’s “Journal für praktische Heilkunde,”\nvol. x. p. 181, and vol. xlviii. p. 95; also in Nasse’s “Zeitschrift für\npsychische Aerzte,” 1819, part iii. p. 460; and in the “Edinburgh Medical\nand Surgical Journal,” 1809, vol. v. p. 319. In the year 1833 all the\npapers announced that the English historian, Dr. Lingard, had died in\nJanuary at Dover of voluntary starvation; according to later accounts, it\nwas not he himself, but a relation of his who died. Still in these\naccounts the persons were generally described as insane, and it is no\nlonger possible to find out how far this was the case. But I will give\nhere a more recent case of this kind, if it were only to ensure the\npreservation of one of the rare instances of this striking and\nextraordinary phenomenon of human nature, which, to all appearance at any\nrate, belongs to the category to which I wish to assign it and could\nhardly be explained in any other way. This case is reported in the\n“Nürnberger Correspondenten” of the 29th July 1813, in these words:—“We\nhear from Bern that in a thick wood near Thurnen a hut has been discovered\nin which was lying the body of a man who had been dead about a month. His\nclothes gave little or no clue to his social position. Two very fine\nshirts lay beside him. The most important article, however, was a Bible\ninterleaved with white paper, part of which had been written upon by the\ndeceased. In this writing he gives the date of his departure from home\n(but does not mention where his home was). He then says that he was driven\nby the Spirit of God into the wilderness to pray and fast. During his\njourney he had fasted seven days and then he had again taken food. After\nthis he had begun again to fast, and continued to do so for the same\nnumber of days as before. From this point we find each day marked with a\nstroke, and of these there are five, at the expiration of which the\npilgrim presumably died. There was further found a letter to a clergyman\nabout a sermon which the deceased heard him preach, but the letter was not\naddressed.” Between this voluntary death arising from extreme asceticism\nand the common suicide resulting from despair there may be various\nintermediate species and combinations, though this is hard to find out.\nBut human nature has depths, obscurities, and perplexities, the analysis\nand elucidation of which is a matter of the very greatest difficulty.",

    "page_content": "that which I call the denial of the will is irreconcilable with the\nearlier explanation of necessity, which belongs just as much to motivation\nas to every other form of the principle of sufficient reason, and\naccording to which, motives, like all causes, are only occasional causes,\nupon which the character unfolds its nature and reveals it with the\nnecessity of a natural law, on account of which we absolutely denied\nfreedom as _liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ_. But far from suppressing\nthis here, I would call it to mind. In truth, real freedom, _i.e._,\nindependence of the principle of sufficient reason, belongs to the will\nonly as a thing-in-itself, not to its manifestation, whose essential form\nis everywhere the principle of sufficient reason, the element or sphere of\nnecessity. But the one case in which that freedom can become directly\nvisible in the manifestation is that in which it makes an end of what\nmanifests itself, and because the mere manifestation, as a link in the\nchain of causes, the living body in time, which contains only phenomena,\nstill continues to exist, the will which manifests itself through this\nphenomenon then stands in contradiction to it, for it denies what the\nphenomenon expresses. In such a case the organs of generation, for\nexample, as the visible form of the sexual impulse, are there and in\nhealth; but yet, in the inmost consciousness, no sensual gratification is\ndesired; and although the whole body is only the visible expression of the\nwill to live, yet the motives which correspond to this will no longer act;\nindeed, the dissolution of the body, the end of the individual, and in\nthis way the greatest check to the natural will, is welcome and desired.\nNow, the contradiction between our assertions of the necessity of the\ndetermination of the will by motives, in accordance with the character, on\nthe one hand, and of the possibility of the entire suppression of the will\nwhereby the motives become powerless, on the other hand, is only the\nrepetition in the reflection of philosophy of this _real_ contradiction\nwhich arises from the direct encroachment of the freedom of the\nwill-in-itself, which knows no necessity, into the sphere of the necessity\nof its manifestation. But the key to the solution of these contradictions\nlies in the fact that the state in which the character is withdrawn from\nthe power of motives does not proceed directly from the will, but from a\nchanged form of knowledge. So long as the knowledge is merely that which\nis involved in the _principium individuationis_ and exclusively follows\nthe principle of sufficient reason, the strength of the motives is\nirresistible. But when the _principium individuationis_ is seen through,\nwhen the Ideas, and indeed the inner nature of the thing-in-itself, as the\nsame will in all, are directly recognised, and from this knowledge an\nuniversal quieter of volition arises, then the particular motives become\nineffective, because the kind of knowledge which corresponds to them is\nobscured and thrown into the background by quite another kind. Therefore\nthe character can never partially change, but must, with the consistency\nof a law of Nature, carry out in the particular the will which it\nmanifests as a whole. But this whole, the character itself, may be\ncompletely suppressed or abolished through the change of knowledge\nreferred to above. It is this suppression or abolition which Asmus, as\nquoted above, marvels at and denotes the “catholic, transcendental\nchange;” and in the Christian Church it has very aptly been called the\n_new birth_, and the knowledge from which it springs, the _work of grace_.\nTherefore it is not a question of a change, but of an entire suppression\nof the character; and hence it arises that, however different the\ncharacters which experience the suppression may have been before it, after\nit they show a great similarity in their conduct, though every one still\nspeaks very differently according to his conceptions and dogmas.\n\nIn this sense, then, the old philosophical doctrine of the freedom of the\nwill, which has constantly been contested and constantly maintained, is\nnot without ground, and the dogma of the Church of the work of grace and\nthe new birth is not without meaning and significance. But we now\nunexpectedly see both united in one, and we can also now understand in\nwhat sense the excellent Malebranche could say, “_La liberté est un\nmystère_,” and was right. For precisely what the Christian mystics call\n_the work of grace_ and _the new birth_, is for us the single direct\nexpression of _the freedom of the will_. It only appears if the will,\nhaving attained to a knowledge of its own real nature, receives from this\na _quieter_, by means of which the motives are deprived of their effect,\nwhich belongs to the province of another kind of knowledge, the objects of\nwhich are merely phenomena. The possibility of the freedom which thus\nexpresses itself is the greatest prerogative of man, which is for ever\nwanting to the brute, because the condition of it is the deliberation of\nreason, which enables him to survey the whole of life independent of the\nimpression of the present. The brute is entirely without the possibility\nof freedom, as, indeed, it is without the possibility of a proper or\ndeliberate choice following upon a completed conflict of motives, which\nfor this purpose would have to be abstract ideas. Therefore with the same\nnecessity with which the stone falls to the earth, the hungry wolf buries\nits fangs in the flesh of its prey, without the possibility of the\nknowledge that it is itself the destroyed as well as the destroyer.\n_Necessity is the kingdom of nature; freedom is the kingdom of grace._\n\nNow because, as we have seen, that _self-suppression of the will_ proceeds\nfrom knowledge, and all knowledge is involuntary, that denial of will\nalso, that entrance into freedom, cannot be forcibly attained to by\nintention or design, but proceeds from the inmost relation of knowing and\nvolition in the man, and therefore comes suddenly, as if spontaneously\nfrom without. This is why the Church has called it _the work of grace_;\nand that it still regards it as independent of the acceptance of grace\ncorresponds to the fact that the effect of the quieter is finally a free\nact of will. And because, in consequence of such a work of grace, the\nwhole nature of man is changed and reversed from its foundation, so that\nhe no longer wills anything of all that he previously willed so intensely,\nso that it is as if a new man actually took the place of the old, the\nChurch has called this consequence of the work of grace the _new birth_.\nFor what it calls the _natural man_, to which it denies all capacity for\ngood, is just the will to live, which must be denied if deliverance from\nan existence such as ours is to be attained. Behind our existence lies\nsomething else, which is only accessible to us if we have shaken off this\nworld.\n\nHaving regard, not to the individuals according to the principle of\nsufficient reason, but to the Idea of man in its unity, Christian theology\nsymbolises _nature_, the _assertion of the will to live_ in Adam, whose\nsin, inherited by us, _i.e._, our unity with him in the Idea, which is\nrepresented in time by the bond of procreation, makes us all partakers of\nsuffering and eternal death. On the other hand, it symbolises _grace_, the\n_denial of the will_, _salvation_, in the incarnate God, who, as free from\nall sin, that is, from all willing of life, cannot, like us, have\nproceeded from the most pronounced assertion of the will, nor can he, like\nus, have a body which is through and through simply concrete will,\nmanifestation of the will; but born of a pure virgin, he has only a\nphantom body. This last is the doctrine of the Docetæ, _i.e._, certain\nChurch Fathers, who in this respect are very consistent. It is especially\ntaught by Apelles, against whom and his followers Tertullian wrote. But\neven Augustine comments thus on the passage, Rom. viii. 3, “God sent his\nSon in the likeness of sinful flesh:” “_Non enim caro peccati erat, quæ\nnon de carnali delectatione nata erat: sed tamen inerat ei similitudo\ncarnis peccati, quia mortalis caro erat_” (Liber 83, _quæst. qu._ 66). He\nalso teaches in his work entitled “_Opus Imperfectum_,” i. 47, that\ninherited sin is both sin and punishment at once. It is already present in\nnew-born children, but only shows itself if they grow up. Yet the origin\nof this sin is to be referred to the will of the sinner. This sinner was\nAdam, but we all existed in him; Adam became miserable, and in him we have\nall become miserable. Certainly the doctrine of original sin (assertion of\nthe will) and of salvation (denial of the will) is the great truth which\nconstitutes the essence of Christianity, while most of what remains is\nonly the clothing of it, the husk or accessories. Therefore Jesus Christ\nought always to be conceived in the universal, as the symbol or\npersonification of the denial of the will to live, but never as an\nindividual, whether according to his mythical history given in the\nGospels, or according to the probably true history which lies at the\nfoundation of this. For neither the one nor the other will easily satisfy\nus entirely. It is merely the vehicle of that conception for the people,\nwho always demand something actual. That in recent times Christianity has\nforgotten its true significance, and degenerated into dull optimism, does\nnot concern us here.\n\nIt is further an original and evangelical doctrine of Christianity—which\nAugustine, with the consent of the leaders of the Church, defended against\nthe platitudes of the Pelagians, and which it was the principal aim of\nLuther’s endeavour to purify from error and re-establish, as he expressly\ndeclares in his book, “_De Servo Arbitrio_,”—the doctrine that _the will\nis not free_, but originally subject to the inclination to evil. Therefore\naccording to this doctrine the deeds of the will are always sinful and\nimperfect, and can never fully satisfy justice; and, finally, these works\ncan never save us, but faith alone, a faith which itself does not spring\nfrom resolution and free will, but from the work of grace, without our\nco-operation, comes to us as from without.\n\nNot only the dogmas referred to before, but also this last genuine\nevangelical dogma belongs to those which at the present day an ignorant\nand dull opinion rejects as absurd or hides. For, in spite of Augustine\nand Luther, it adheres to the vulgar Pelagianism, which the rationalism of\nthe day really is, and treats as antiquated those deeply significant\ndogmas which are peculiar and essential to Christianity in the strictest\nsense; while, on the other hand, it holds fast and regards as the\nprincipal matter only the dogma that originates in Judaism, and has been\nretained from it, and is merely historically connected with\nChristianity.(91) We, however, recognise in the doctrine referred to above\nthe truth completely agreeing with the result of our own investigations.\nWe see that true virtue and holiness of disposition have their origin not\nin deliberate choice (works), but in knowledge (faith); just as we have in\nlike manner developed it from our leading thought. If it were works, which\nspring from motives and deliberate intention, that led to salvation, then,\nhowever one may turn it, virtue would always be a prudent, methodical,\nfar-seeing egoism. But the faith to which the Christian Church promises\nsalvation is this: that as through the fall of the first man we are all\npartakers of sin and subject to death and perdition, through the divine\nsubstitute, through grace and the taking upon himself of our fearful\nguilt, we are all saved, without any merit of our own (of the person);\nsince that which can proceed from the intentional (determined by motives)\naction of the person, works, can never justify us, from its very nature,\njust because it is _intentional_, action induced by motives, _opus\noperatum_. Thus in this faith there is implied, first of all, that our\ncondition is originally and essentially an incurable one, from which we\nneed _salvation_; then, that we ourselves essentially belong to evil, and\nare so firmly bound to it that our works according to law and precept,\n_i.e._, according to motives, can never satisfy justice nor save us; but\nsalvation is only obtained through faith, _i.e._, through a changed mode\nof knowing, and this faith can only come through grace, thus as from\nwithout. This means that the salvation is one which is quite foreign to\nour person, and points to a denial and surrender of this person necessary\nto salvation. Works, the result of the law as such, can never justify,\nbecause they are always action following upon motives. Luther demands (in\nhis book “_De Libertate Christiana_”) that after the entrance of faith the\ngood works shall proceed from it entirely of themselves, as symptoms, as\nfruits of it; yet by no means as constituting in themselves a claim to\nmerit, justification, or reward, but taking place quite voluntarily and\ngratuitously. So we also hold that from the ever-clearer penetration of\nthe _principium individuationis_ proceeds, first, merely free justice,\nthen love, extending to the complete abolition of egoism, and finally\nresignation or denial of the will.\n\nI have here introduced these dogmas of Christian theology, which in\nthemselves are foreign to philosophy, merely for the purpose of showing\nthat the ethical doctrine which proceeds from our whole investigation, and\nis in complete agreement and connection with all its parts, although new\nand unprecedented in its expression, is by no means so in its real nature,\nbut fully agrees with the Christian dogmas properly so called, and indeed,\nas regards its essence, was contained and present in them. It also agrees\nquite as accurately with the doctrines and ethical teachings of the sacred\nbooks of India, which in their turn are presented in quite different\nforms. At the same time the calling to mind of the dogmas of the Christian\nChurch serves to explain and illustrate the apparent contradiction between\nthe necessity of all expressions of character when motives are presented\n(the kingdom of Nature) on the one hand, and the freedom of the will in\nitself, to deny itself, and abolish the character with all the necessity\nof the motives based upon it (the kingdom of grace) on the other hand.",

    "page_content": "development of that one thought which it has been my object to impart; and\nI by no means desire to conceal here an objection which concerns this last\npart of my exposition, but rather to point out that it lies in the nature\nof the question, and that it is quite impossible to remove it. It is this,\nthat after our investigation has brought us to the point at which we have\nbefore our eyes perfect holiness, the denial and surrender of all\nvolition, and thus the deliverance from a world whose whole existence we\nhave found to be suffering, this appears to us as a passing away into\nempty nothingness.\n\nOn this I must first remark, that the conception of nothing is essentially\nrelative, and always refers to a definite something which it negatives.\nThis quality has been attributed (by Kant) merely to the _nihil\nprivativum_, which is indicated by - as opposed to +, which -, from an\nopposite point of view, might become +, and in opposition to this _nihil\nprivativum_ the _nihil negativum_ has been set up, which would in every\nreference be nothing, and as an example of this the logical contradiction\nwhich does away with itself has been given. But more closely considered,\nno absolute nothing, no proper _nihil negativum_ is even thinkable; but\neverything of this kind, when considered from a higher standpoint or\nsubsumed under a wider concept, is always merely a _nihil privativum_.\nEvery nothing is thought as such only in relation to something, and\npresupposes this relation, and thus also this something. Even a logical\ncontradiction is only a relative nothing. It is no thought of the reason,\nbut it is not on that account an absolute nothing; for it is a combination\nof words; it is an example of the unthinkable, which is necessary in logic\nin order to prove the laws of thought. Therefore if for this end such an\nexample is sought, we will stick to the nonsense as the positive which we\nare in search of, and pass over the sense as the negative. Thus every\n_nihil negativum_, if subordinated to a higher concept, will appear as a\nmere _nihil privativum_ or relative nothing, which can, moreover, always\nexchange signs with what it negatives, so that that would then be thought\nas negation, and it itself as assertion. This also agrees with the result\nof the difficult dialectical investigation of the meaning of nothing which\nPlato gives in the “Sophist” (pp. 277-287): Την του ἑτερου φυσιν\nαποδειξαντες ουσαν τε, και κατακεκερματισμενην επι παντα τα οντα προς\nαλληλα, το προς το ον ἑκαστου μοριου αυτης αντιτιθεμενον, ετολμησαμεν\nειπειν, ὡς αυτο τουτο εστιν οντως το μη ον (_Cum enim ostenderemus,\nalterius ipsius naturam esse perque omnia entia divisam atque dispersam in\nvicem; tunc partem ejus oppositam ei, quod cujusque ens est, esse ipsum\nrevera non ens asseruimus_).\n\nThat which is generally received as positive, which we call the real, and\nthe negation of which the concept nothing in its most general significance\nexpresses, is just the world as idea, which I have shown to be the\nobjectivity and mirror of the will. Moreover, we ourselves are just this\nwill and this world, and to them belongs the idea in general, as one\naspect of them. The form of the idea is space and time, therefore for this\npoint of view all that is real must be in some place and at some time.\nDenial, abolition, conversion of the will, is also the abolition and the\nvanishing of the world, its mirror. If we no longer perceive it in this\nmirror, we ask in vain where it has gone, and then, because it has no\nlonger any where and when, complain that it has vanished into nothing.\n\nA reversed point of view, if it were possible for us, would reverse the\nsigns and show the real for us as nothing, and that nothing as the real.\nBut as long as we ourselves are the will to live, this last—nothing as the\nreal—can only be known and signified by us negatively, because the old\nsaying of Empedocles, that like can only be known by like, deprives us\nhere of all knowledge, as, conversely, upon it finally rests the\npossibility of all our actual knowledge, _i.e._, the world as idea; for\nthe world is the self-knowledge of the will.\n\nIf, however, it should be absolutely insisted upon that in some way or\nother a positive knowledge should be attained of that which philosophy can\nonly express negatively as the denial of the will, there would be nothing\nfor it but to refer to that state which all those who have attained to\ncomplete denial of the will have experienced, and which has been variously\ndenoted by the names ecstasy, rapture, illumination, union with God, and\nso forth; a state, however, which cannot properly be called knowledge,\nbecause it has not the form of subject and object, and is, moreover, only\nattainable in one’s own experience and cannot be further communicated.\n\nWe, however, who consistently occupy the standpoint of philosophy, must be\nsatisfied here with negative knowledge, content to have reached the utmost\nlimit of the positive. We have recognised the inmost nature of the world\nas will, and all its phenomena as only the objectivity of will; and we\nhave followed this objectivity from the unconscious working of obscure\nforces of Nature up to the completely conscious action of man. Therefore\nwe shall by no means evade the consequence, that with the free denial, the\nsurrender of the will, all those phenomena are also abolished; that\nconstant strain and effort without end and without rest at all the grades\nof objectivity, in which and through which the world consists; the\nmultifarious forms succeeding each other in gradation; the whole\nmanifestation of the will; and, finally, also the universal forms of this\nmanifestation, time and space, and also its last fundamental form, subject\nand object; all are abolished. No will: no idea, no world.\n\nBefore us there is certainly only nothingness. But that which resists this\npassing into nothing, our nature, is indeed just the will to live, which\nwe ourselves are as it is our world. That we abhor annihilation so\ngreatly, is simply another expression of the fact that we so strenuously\nwill life, and are nothing but this will, and know nothing besides it. But\nif we turn our glance from our own needy and embarrassed condition to\nthose who have overcome the world, in whom the will, having attained to\nperfect self-knowledge, found itself again in all, and then freely denied\nitself, and who then merely wait to see the last trace of it vanish with\nthe body which it animates; then, instead of the restless striving and\neffort, instead of the constant transition from wish to fruition, and from\njoy to sorrow, instead of the never-satisfied and never-dying hope which\nconstitutes the life of the man who wills, we shall see that peace which\nis above all reason, that perfect calm of the spirit, that deep rest, that\ninviolable confidence and serenity, the mere reflection of which in the\ncountenance, as Raphael and Correggio have represented it, is an entire\nand certain gospel; only knowledge remains, the will has vanished. We look\nwith deep and painful longing upon this state, beside which the misery and\nwretchedness of our own is brought out clearly by the contrast. Yet this\nis the only consideration which can afford us lasting consolation, when,\non the one hand, we have recognised incurable suffering and endless misery\nas essential to the manifestation of will, the world; and, on the other\nhand, see the world pass away with the abolition of will, and retain\nbefore us only empty nothingness. Thus, in this way, by contemplation of\nthe life and conduct of saints, whom it is certainly rarely granted us to\nmeet with in our own experience, but who are brought before our eyes by\ntheir written history, and, with the stamp of inner truth, by art, we must\nbanish the dark impression of that nothingness which we discern behind all\nvirtue and holiness as their final goal, and which we fear as children\nfear the dark; we must not even evade it like the Indians, through myths\nand meaningless words, such as reabsorption in Brahma or the Nirvana of\nthe Buddhists. Rather do we freely acknowledge that what remains after the\nentire abolition of will is for all those who are still full of will\ncertainly nothing; but, conversely, to those in whom the will has turned\nand has denied itself, this our world, which is so real, with all its suns\nand milky-ways—is nothing.(92)\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n    1 F.

Epictet., c. v.\n\n   25 Τουτο γαρ εστι το αιτιον τοις ανθρωποις παντων των κακων, το τας\n      προληψεις τας κοινας μη δυνασθαι εφαρμοξειν ταις επι μερους (Hæc est\n      causa mortalibus omnium malorum, non posse communes notiones aptare\n      singularibus).

Scient., L.\n      iv. in fine.) thinks that all mechanical and physical movement of\n      bodies has always been preceded by perception in these bodies;\n      though a glimmering of truth lies at the bottom of this false\n      proposition. This is also the case with Kepler’s opinion, expressed\n      in his essay _De Planeta Martis_, that the planets must have\n      knowledge in order to keep their elliptical courses so correctly,\n      and to regulate the velocity of their motion so that the triangle of\n      the plane of their course always remains proportional to the time in\n      which they pass through its base.\n\n   29 Cf. Ch. xix. of the Supplement.\n\n   30 Cf. Ch. xx. of the Supplement, and also in my work, “_Ueber den\n      Willen in der Natur_,” the chapters on Physiology and Comparative\n      Anatomy, where the subject I have only touched upon here is fully\n      discussed.\n\n   31 This is specially treated in the 27th Ch. of the Supplement.\n\n   32 This subject is fully worked out in my prize essay on the freedom of\n      the will, in which therefore (pp. 29-44 of the “Grundprobleme der\n      Ethik”) the relation of _cause_, _stimulus_, and _motive_ has also\n      been fully explained.\n\n   33 Cf. Ch. xxiii. of the Supplement, and also the Ch. on the physiology\n      of plants in my work “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” and the Ch. on\n      physical astronomy, which is of great importance with regard to the\n      kernel of my metaphysic.\n\n   34 Wenzel, De Structura Cerebri Hominis et Brutorum, 1812, ch. iii.;\n      Cuvier, Leçons d’Anat., comp. leçon 9, arts. 4 and 5; Vic. d’Azyr,\n      Hist. de l’Acad. de Sc. de Paris, 1783, pp. 470 and 483.\n\n   35 On the 16th of September 1840, at a lecture upon Egyptian Archæology\n      delivered by Mr. Pettigrew at the Literary and Scientific Institute\n      of London, he showed some corns of wheat which Sir G. Wilkinson had\n      found in a grave at Thebes, in which they must have lain for three\n      thousand years. They were found in an hermetically sealed vase. Mr.\n      Pettigrew had sowed twelve grains, and obtained a plant which grew\n      five feet high, and the seeds of which were now quite ripe.—_Times_,\n      21st September 1840. In the same way in 1830 Mr. Haulton produced in\n      the Medical Botanical Society of London a bulbous root which was\n      found in the hand of an Egyptian mummy, in which it was probably put\n      in observance of some religious rite, and which must have been at\n      least two thousand years old. He had planted it in a flower-pot, in\n      which it grew up and flourished. This is quoted from the Medical\n      Journal of 1830 in the Journal of the Royal Institute of Great\n      Britain, October 1830, p. 196.—“In the garden of Mr. Grimstone of\n      the Herbarium, Highgate, London, is a pea in full fruit, which has\n      sprung from a pea that Mr. Pettigrew and the officials of the\n      British Museum took out of a vase which had been found in an\n      Egyptian sarcophagus, where it must have lain 2844 years.”—_Times_,\n      16th August 1844. Indeed, the living toads found in limestone lead\n      to the conclusion that even animal life is capable of such a\n      suspension for thousands of years, if this is begun in the dormant\n      period and maintained by special circumstances.\n\n   36 Cf.

Chap. xxxi. of the Supplement.\n\n   51 I am all the more delighted and astonished, forty years after I so\n      timidly and hesitatingly advanced this thought, to discover that it\n      has already been expressed by St. Augustine: _Arbusta formas suas\n      varias, quibus mundi hujus visibilis structura formosa est,\n      sentiendas sensibus praebent; ut, pro eo quod_ NOSSE _non possunt,\n      quasi_ INNOTESCERE _velle videantur_.—_De civ.

Everything has its language by which to reveal itself....\n      And this is the language of nature when everything speaks out of its\n      own property, and continually manifests and declares itself, ... for\n      each thing reveals its mother, which thus gives _the essence and the\n      will_ to the form.”\n\n   54 The last sentence is the German of the _il n’y a que l’esprit qui\n      sente l’esprit_, of Helvetius. In the first edition there was no\n      occasion to point this out, but since then the age has become so\n      degraded and ignorant through the stupefying influence of the\n      Hegelian sophistry, that some might quite likely say that an\n      antithesis was intended here between “spirit and nature.” I am\n      therefore obliged to guard myself in express terms against the\n      suspicion of such vulgar sophisms.\n\n   55 This digression is worked out more fully in the 36th Chapter of the\n      Supplement.\n\n   56 In order to understand this passage it is necessary to have read the\n      whole of the next book.\n\n_   57 Apparent rari, nantes in gurgite vasto._\n\n   58 Cf. Ch. xxxiv. of Supplement.\n\n   59 It is scarcely necessary to say that wherever I speak of poets I\n      refer exclusively to that rare phenomenon the great true poet. I\n      mean no one else; least of all that dull insipid tribe, the mediocre\n      poets, rhymsters, and inventors of fables, that flourishes so\n      luxuriantly at the present day in Germany. They ought rather to have\n      the words shouted in their ears unceasingly from all sides—\n\n      _Mediocribus esse poëtis_\n      _ Non homines, non Dî, non concessere columnæ._\n\n      It is worthy of serious consideration what an amount of time—both\n      their own and other people’s—and paper is lost by this swarm of\n      mediocre poets, and how injurious is their influence. For the public\n      always seizes on what is new, and has naturally a greater proneness\n      to what is perverse and dull as akin to itself. Therefore these\n      works of the mediocre poets draw it away and hold it back from the\n      true masterpieces and the education they afford, and thus working in\n      direct antagonism to the benign influence of genius, they ruin taste\n      more and more, and retard the progress of the age. Such poets should\n      therefore be scourged with criticism and satire without indulgence\n      or sympathy till they are induced, for their own good, to apply\n      their muse rather to reading what is good than to writing what is\n      bad. For if the bungling of the incompetent so raised the wrath of\n      the gentle Apollo that he could flay Marsyas, I do not see on what\n      the mediocre poets will base their claim to tolerance.\n\n   60 Cf.

Ch. xxxix. of Supplement.\n\n   64 The following remark may assist those for whom it is not too subtle\n      to understand clearly that the individual is only the phenomenon,\n      not the thing in itself. Every individual is, on the one hand, the\n      subject of knowing, _i.e._, the complemental condition of the\n      possibility of the whole objective world, and, on the other hand, a\n      particular phenomenon of will, the same will which objectifies\n      itself in everything. But this double nature of our being does not\n      rest upon a self-existing unity, otherwise it would be possible for\n      us to be conscious of ourselves _in ourselves, and independent of\n      the objects of knowledge and will_. Now this is by no means\n      possible, for as soon as we turn into ourselves to make the attempt,\n      and seek for once to know ourselves fully by means of introspective\n      reflection, we are lost in a bottomless void; we find ourselves like\n      the hollow glass globe, from out of which a voice speaks whose cause\n      is not to be found in it, and whereas we desired to comprehend\n      ourselves, we find, with a shudder, nothing but a vanishing spectre.\n\n   65 “Scholastici docuerunt, quod æternitas non sit temporis sine fine\n      aut principio successio; sed _Nunc stans_, _i.e._, idem nobis _Nunc\n      esse_, quod erat _Nunc Adamo_, _i.e._, inter _nunc_ et _tunc_ nullam\n      esse differentiam.”—Hobbes, Leviathan, c. 46.\n\n   66 In Eckermann’s “Conversations of Goethe” (vol. i. p. 161), Goethe\n      says: “Our spirit is a being of a nature quite indestructible, and\n      its activity continues from eternity to eternity. It is like the\n      sun, which seems to set only to our earthly eyes, but which, in\n      reality, never sets, but shines on unceasingly.” Goethe has taken\n      the simile from me; not I from him. Without doubt he used it in this\n      conversation, which was held in 1824, in consequence of a (possibly\n      unconscious) reminiscence of the above passage, for it occurs in the\n      first edition, p. 401, in exactly the same words, and it is also\n      repeated at p. 528 of that edition, as at the close of § 65 of the\n      present work. The first edition was sent to him in December 1818,\n      and in March 1819, when I was at Naples, he sent me his\n      congratulations by letter, through my sister, and enclosed a piece\n      of paper upon which he had noted the places of certain passages\n      which had specially pleased him. Thus he had read my book.\n\n   67 This is expressed in the Veda by saying, that when a man dies his\n      sight becomes one with the sun, his smell with the earth, his taste\n      with water, his hearing with the air, his speech with fire, &c., &c.\n      (Oupnek’hat, vol. i. p. 249 _et seq._) And also by the fact that, in\n      a special ceremony, the dying man gives over his senses and all his\n      faculties singly to his son, in whom they are now supposed to live\n      on (Oupnek’hat, vol. ii. p. 82 _et seq._)\n\n   68 Cf.

Only the name _formation_ is not very suitable, for the\n      spending of any labour upon a thing does not need to be a forming or\n      fashioning of it.\n\n   75 The further exposition of the philosophy of law here laid down will\n      be found in my prize-essay, “Ueber das Fundament der Moral,” § 17,\n      pp. 221-230 of 1st ed., pp. 216-226 of 2d ed.\n\n   76 Cf. Ch. xlvii. of Supplement.\n\n   77 Oupnek’hat, vol. i. p. 60 et seq.\n\n   78 That Spanish bishop who, in the last war, poisoned both himself and\n      the French generals at his own table, is an instance of this; and\n      also various incidents in that war. Examples are also to be found in\n      Montaigne, Bk. ii. ch. 12.\n\n   79 Observe, in passing, that what gives every positive system of\n      religion its great strength, the point of contact through which it\n      takes possession of the soul, is entirely its ethical side. Not,\n      however, the ethical side directly as such, but as it appears firmly\n      united and interwoven with the element of mythical dogma which is\n      present in every system of religion, and as intelligible only by\n      means of this. So much is this the case, that although the ethical\n      significance of action cannot be explained in accordance with the\n      principle of sufficient reason, yet since every mythus follows this\n      principle, believers regard the ethical significance of action as\n      quite inseparable, and indeed as absolutely identical, and regard\n      every attack upon the mythus as an attack upon right and virtue.\n      This goes so far that among monotheistic nations atheism or\n      godlessness has become synonymous with the absence of all morality.\n      To the priests such confusions of conceptions are welcome, and only\n      in consequence of them could that horrible monstrosity fanaticism\n      arise and govern, not merely single individuals who happen to be\n      specially perverse and bad, but whole nations, and finally embody\n      itself in the Western world as the Inquisition (to the honour of\n      mankind be it said that this only happened once in their history),\n      which, according to the latest and most authentic accounts, in\n      Madrid alone (in the rest of Spain there were many more such\n      ecclesiastical dens of murderers) in 300 years put 300,000 human\n      beings to a painful death at the stake on theological grounds—a fact\n      of which every zealot ought to be reminded whenever he begins to\n      make himself heard.\n\n   80 The Church would say that these are merely _opera operata_, which do\n      not avail unless grace gives the faith which leads to the new birth.\n      But of this farther on.\n\n   81 The right of man over the life and powers of the brutes rests on the\n      fact that, because with the growing clearness of consciousness\n      suffering increases in like measure; the pain which the brute\n      suffers through death or work is not so great as man would suffer by\n      merely denying himself the flesh, or the powers of the brutes.\n      Therefore man may carry the assertion of his existence to the extent\n      of denying the existence of the brute, and the will to live as a\n      whole endures less suffering in this way than if the opposite course\n      were adopted. This at once determines the extent of the use man may\n      make of the powers of the brutes without wrong; a limit, however,\n      which is often transgressed, especially in the case of beasts of\n      burden and dogs used in the chase; to which the activity of\n      societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals is principally\n      devoted. In my opinion, that right does not extend to vivisection,\n      particularly of the higher animals. On the other hand, the insect\n      does not suffer so much through its death as a man suffers from its\n      sting. The Hindus do not understand this.\n\n   82 As I wander sunk in thought, so strong a sympathy with myself comes\n      over me that I must often weep aloud, which otherwise I am not wont\n      to do.\n\n   83 Cf. Ch. xlvii. of Supplement. It is scarcely necessary to remind the\n      reader that the whole ethical doctrine given in outline in §§ 61-67\n      has been explained fully and in detail in my prize-essay on the\n      foundation of morals.\n\n   84 This thought is expressed by a beautiful simile in the ancient\n      philosophical Sanscrit writing, “Sankhya Karica:” “Yet the soul\n      remains a while invested with body; as the potter’s wheel continues\n      whirling after the pot has been fashioned, by force of the impulse\n      previously given to it. When separation of the informed soul from\n      its corporeal frame at length takes place and nature in respect of\n      it ceases, then is absolute and final deliverance accomplished.”\n      Colebrooke, “On the Philosophy of the Hindus: Miscellaneous Essays,”\n      vol i. p. 271. Also in the “Sankhya Karica by Horace Wilson,” § 67,\n      p. 184.\n\n   85 See, for example, “Oupnek’hat, studio Anquetil du Perron,” vol. ii.,\n      Nos. 138, 144, 145, 146. “Mythologie des Indous,” par Mad. de\n      Polier, vol. ii., ch. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. “Asiatisches Magazin,” by\n      Klaproth: in the first volume, “Ueber die Fo-Religion,” also\n      “Baghnat Geeta” or “Gespräche zwischen Krishna und Arjoon;” in the\n      second volume, “Moha-Mudgava.” Also, “Institutes of Hindu Law, or\n      the Ordinances of Manu,” from the Sanscrit, by Sir William Jones\n      (German by Hüttner, 1797), especially the sixth and twelfth\n      chapters. Finally, many passages in the “Asiatic Researches.” (In\n      the last forty years Indian literature has grown so much in Europe,\n      that if I were now to complete this note to the first edition, it\n      would occupy several pages.)\n\n   86 At the procession of Jagganath in June 1840, eleven Hindus threw\n      themselves under the wheels, and were instantly killed. (Letter of\n      an East Indian proprietor in the _Times_ of 30th December 1840.)\n\n   87 On δευτερος πλους cf. Stob. Floril., vol. ii. p. 374.\n\n   88 Bruckeri Hist.

Ch. xlviii. of the Supplement.\n\n   91 How truly this is the case may be seen from the fact that all the\n      contradictions and inconceivabilities contained in the Christian\n      dogmatics, consistently systematised by Augustine, which have led to\n      the Pelagian insipidity which is opposed to them, vanish as soon as\n      we abstract from the fundamental Jewish dogma, and recognize that\n      man is not the work of another, but of his own will. Then all is at\n      once clear and correct: then there is no need of freedom in the\n      _operari_, for it lies in the _esse_; and there also lies the sin as\n      original sin. The work of grace is, however, our own. To the\n      rationalistic point of view of the day, on the contrary, many\n      doctrines of the Augustinian dogmatics, founded on the New\n      Testament, appear quite untenable, and indeed revolting; for\n      example, predestination. Accordingly Christianity proper is\n      rejected, and a return is made to crude Judaism. But the\n      miscalculation or the original weakness of Christian dogmatics\n      lies—where it is never sought—precisely in that which is withdrawn\n      from all investigation as established and certain. Take this away\n      and the whole of dogmatics is rational; for this dogma destroys\n      theology as it does all other sciences. If any one studies the\n      Augustinian theology in the books “_De Civitate Dei_” (especially in\n      the Fourteenth Book), he experiences something analogous to the\n      feeling of one who tries to make a body stand whose centre of\n      gravity falls outside it; however he may turn it and place it, it\n      always tumbles over again. So here, in spite of all the efforts and\n      sophisms of Augustine, the guilt and misery of the world always\n      falls back on God, who made everything and everything that is in\n      everything, and also knew how all things would go. That Augustine\n      himself was conscious of the difficulty, and puzzled by it, I have\n      already shown in my prize-essay on the Freedom of the Will (ch. iv.\n      pp. 66-68 of the first and second editions). In the same way, the\n      contradiction between the goodness of God and the misery of the\n      world, and also between the freedom of the will and the\n      foreknowledge of God, is the inexhaustible theme of a controversy\n      which lasted nearly a hundred years between the Cartesians,\n      Malebranche, Leibnitz, Bayle, Clarke, Arnauld, and many others. The\n      only dogma which was regarded as fixed by all parties was the\n      existence and attributes of God, and they all unceasingly move in a\n      circle, because they seek to bring these things into harmony,\n      _i.e._, to solve a sum that will not come right, but always shows a\n      remainder at some new place whenever we have concealed it elsewhere.\n      But it does not occur to any one to seek for the source of the\n      difficulty in the fundamental assumption, although it palpably\n      obtrudes itself. Bayle alone shows that he saw this.\n\n   92 This is also just the Prajna—Paramita of the Buddhists, the “beyond\n      all knowledge,” _i.e._, the point at which subject and object are no\n      more. (Cf. J. J. Schmidt, “Ueber das Mahajana und\n      Pratschna-Paramita.”)",

    "page_content": "and of the faculty of perception is completed, and no conceptions and no\nthinking are required in addition; therefore the brute also has these\n_ideas_. If conceptions are added, if thinking is added, to which\nspontaneity may certainly be attributed, then knowledge of _perception_ is\nentirely abandoned, and a completely different class of ideas comes into\nconsciousness, non-perceptible abstract conceptions. This is the activity\nof the _reason_, which yet obtains the whole content of its thinking only\nfrom the previous perception, and the comparison of it with other\nperceptions and conceptions. But thus Kant brings thinking into the\nperception, and lays the foundation for the inextricable confusion of\nintuitive and abstract knowledge which I am now engaged in condemning. He\nallows the perception, taken by itself, to be without understanding,\npurely sensuous, and thus quite passive, and only through thinking\n(category of the understanding) does he allow an _object_ to be\napprehended: thus he brings _thought into the perception_. But then,\nagain, the object of thinking is an individual real object; and in this\nway thinking loses its essential character of universality and\nabstraction, and instead of general conceptions receives individual things\nas its object: thus again he _brings perception into thinking_. From this\nsprings the inextricable confusion referred to, and the consequences of\nthis first false step extend over his whole theory of knowledge. Through\nthe whole of his theory the utter confusion of the idea of perception with\nthe abstract idea tends towards a something between the two which he\nexpounds as the object of knowledge through the understanding and its\ncategories, and calls this knowledge _experience_. It is hard to believe\nthat Kant really figured to himself something fully determined and really\ndistinct in this object of the understanding; I shall now prove this\nthrough the tremendous contradiction which runs through the whole\nTranscendental Logic, and is the real source of the obscurity in which it\nis involved.\n\nIn the “Critique of Pure Reason,” p. 67-69; V. 92-94; p. 89, 90; V. 122,\n123; further, V. 135, 139, 153, he repeats and insists: the understanding\nis no faculty of perception, its knowledge is not intuitive but\ndiscursive; the understanding is the faculty of judging (p. 69; V. 94),\nand a judgment is indirect knowledge, an idea of an idea (p. 68; V. 93);\nthe understanding is the faculty of thinking, and thinking is knowledge\nthrough conceptions (p. 69; V. 94); the categories of the understanding\nare by no means the conditions under which objects are given in perception\n(p. 89; V. 122), and perception in no way requires the functions of\nthinking (p. 91; V. 123); our understanding can only think, not perceive\n(V. pp. 135, 139). Further, in the “Prolegomena,” § 20, he says that\nperception, sensation, _perceptio_, belongs merely to the senses; judgment\nto the understanding alone; and in § 22, that the work of the senses is to\nperceive, that of the understanding to think, _i.e._, to judge. Finally,\nin the “Critique of Practical Reason,” fourth edition, p. 247;\nRosenkranz’s edition, p. 281, he says that the understanding is\ndiscursive; its ideas are thoughts, not perceptions. All this is in Kant’s\nown words.\n\nFrom this it follows that this perceptible world would exist for us even\nif we had no understanding at all; that it comes into our head in a quite\ninexplicable manner, which he constantly indicates by his strange\nexpression the perception is _given_, without ever explaining this\nindefinite and metaphorical expression further.\n\nNow all that has been quoted is contradicted in the most glaring manner by\nthe whole of the rest of his doctrine of the understanding, of its\ncategories, and of the possibility of experience as he explains it in the\nTranscendental Logic. Thus (Critique of Pure Reason, p. 79; V. 105), the\nunderstanding through its categories brings unity into the manifold of\n_perception_, and the pure conceptions of the understanding refer _a\npriori_ to objects of _perception_. P. 94; V. 126, the “categories are the\ncondition of experience, whether of perception, which is found in it, or\nof thought.” V. p. 127, the understanding is the originator of experience.\nV. p. 128, the categories determine the _perception_ of objects. V. p.\n130, all that we present to ourselves as connected in the object (which is\nyet certainly something perceptible and not an abstraction), has been so\nconnected by an act of the understanding. V. p. 135, the understanding is\nexplained anew as the faculty of combining _a priori_, and of bringing the\nmultiplicity of given ideas under the unity of apperception; but according\nto all ordinary use of words, apperception is not the thinking of a\nconception, but is _perception_. V. p. 136, we find a first principle of\nthe possibility of all perception in connection with the understanding. V.\np. 143, it stands as the heading, that all sense perception is conditioned\nby the categories. At the same place the _logical function of the\njudgment_ also brings the manifold of given perceptions under an\napperception in general, and the manifold of a given perception stands\nnecessarily under the categories. V. p. 144, unity comes into perception,\nby means of the categories, through the understanding. V. p. 145, the\nthinking of the understanding is very strangely explained as synthetically\ncombining, connecting, and arranging the manifold of perception. V. p.\n161, experience is only possible through the categories, and consists in\nthe connection of _sensations_, which, however, are just perceptions. V.\np. 159, the categories are _a priori_ knowledge of the objects of\nperception in general. Further, here and at V. p. 163 and 165, a chief\ndoctrine of Kant’s is given, this: _that the understanding first makes\nNature possible_, because it prescribes laws for it _a priori_, and Nature\nadapts itself to the system of the understanding, and so on. Nature,\nhowever, is certainly perceptible and not an abstraction; therefore, the\nunderstanding must be a faculty of perception. V. p. 168, it is said, the\nconceptions of the understanding are the principles of the possibility of\nexperience, and the latter is the condition of phenomena in space and time\nin general; phenomena which, however, certainly exist in perception.\nFinally, p. 189-211; V. 232-265, the long proof is given (the\nincorrectness of which is shown in detail in my essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason, § 23) that the objective succession and also the\ncoexistence of objects of experience are not sensuously apprehended, but\nare only brought into Nature by the understanding, and that Nature itself\nfirst becomes possible in this way. Yet it is certain that Nature, the\ncourse of events, and the coexistence of states, is purely perceptible,\nand no mere abstract thought.\n\nI challenge every one who shares my respect towards Kant to reconcile\nthese contradictions and to show that in his doctrine of the object of\nexperience and the way it is determined by the activity of the\nunderstanding and its twelve functions, Kant thought something quite\ndistinct and definite. I am convinced that the contradiction I have\npointed out, which extends through the whole Transcendental Logic, is the\nreal reason of the great obscurity of its language. Kant himself, in fact,\nwas dimly conscious of the contradiction, inwardly combated it, but yet\neither would not or could not bring it to distinct consciousness, and\ntherefore veiled it from himself and others, and avoided it by all kinds\nof subterfuges. This is perhaps also the reason why he made out of the\nfaculties of knowledge such a strange complicated machine, with so many\nwheels, as the twelve categories, the transcendental synthesis of\nimagination, of the inner sense, of the transcendental unity of\napperception, also the schematism of the pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding, &c., &c. And notwithstanding this great apparatus, not even\nan attempt is made to explain the perception of the external world, which\nis after all the principal fact in our knowledge; but this pressing claim\nis very meanly rejected, always through the same meaningless metaphorical\nexpression: “The empirical perception is given us.” On p. 145 of the fifth\nedition, we learn further that the perception is given through the object;\ntherefore the object must be something different from the perception.\n\nIf, now, we endeavour to investigate Kant’s inmost meaning, not clearly\nexpressed by himself, we find that in reality such an object, different\nfrom the perception, but which is by no means a conception, is for him the\nproper object for the understanding; indeed that it must be by means of\nthe strange assumption of such an object, which cannot be presented in\nperception, that the perception first becomes experience. I believe that\nan old deeply-rooted prejudice in Kant, dead to all investigation, is the\nultimate reason of the assumption of such an _absolute object_, which is\nan object in itself, _i.e._, without a subject. It is certainly not the\n_perceived object_, but through the conception it is added to the\nperception by thought, as something corresponding to it; and now the\nperception is experience, and has value and truth, which it thus only\nreceives through the relation to a conception (in diametrical opposition\nto my exposition, according to which the conception only receives value\nand truth from the perception). It is then the proper function of the\ncategories to add on in thought to the perception this directly\nnon-perceptible object. “The object is given only through perception, and\nis afterwards thought in accordance with the category” (Critique of Pure\nReason, first edition, p. 399). This is made specially clear by a passage\non p. 125 of the fifth edition: “Now the question arises whether\nconceptions _a priori_ do not also come first as conditions under which\nalone a thing can be, not perceived certainly, but yet _thought_ as an\n_object_ in general,” which he answers in the affirmative. Here the source\nof the error and the confusion in which it is involved shows itself\ndistinctly. For the _object_ as such exists always only for _perception_\nand in it; it may now be completed through the senses, or, when it is\nabsent, through the imagination. What is thought, on the contrary, is\nalways an universal non-perceptible _conception_, which certainly can be\nthe conception of an object in general; but only indirectly by means of\nconceptions does thought relate itself to _objects_, which always are and\nremain _perceptible_. For our thinking is not able to impart reality to\nperceptions; this they have, so far as they are capable of it (empirical\nreality) of themselves; but it serves to bring together the common element\nand the results of perceptions, in order to preserve them, and to be able\nto use them more easily. But Kant ascribes the objects themselves to\nthought, in order to make experience and the objective world dependent\nupon _understanding_, yet without allowing understanding to be a faculty\nof _perception_. In this relation he certainly distinguishes perception\nfrom thought, but he makes particular things sometimes the object of\nperception and sometimes the object of thought. In reality, however, they\nare only the object of the former; our empirical perception is at once\n_objective_, just because it proceeds from the causal nexus. Things, not\nideas different from them, are directly its object. Particular things as\nsuch are perceived in the understanding and through the senses; the\none-sided impression upon the latter is at once completed by the\nimagination. But, on the contrary, as soon as we pass over to thought, we\nleave the particular things, and have to do with general conceptions,\nwhich cannot be presented in perception, although we afterwards apply the\nresults of our thought to particular things. If we hold firmly to this,\nthe inadmissibleness of the assumption becomes evident that the perception\nof things only obtains reality and becomes experience through the thought\nof these very things applying its twelve categories. Rather in perception\nitself the empirical reality, and consequently experience, is already\ngiven; but the perception itself can only come into existence by the\napplication to sensation of the knowledge of the causal nexus, which is\nthe one function of the understanding. Perception is accordingly in\nreality intellectual, which is just what Kant denies.\n\nBesides in the passages quoted, the assumption of Kant here criticised\nwill be found expressed with admirable clearness in the “Critique of\nJudgment,” § 36, just at the beginning; also in the “Metaphysical\nPrinciples of Natural Science,” in the note to the first explanation of\n“Phenomenology.” But with a _naïveté_ which Kant ventured upon least of\nall with reference to this doubtful point, it is to be found most\ndistinctly laid down in the book of a Kantian, Kiesewetter’s “_Grundriss\neiner algemeinen Logik_,” third edition, part i., p. 434 of the\nexposition, and part ii., § 52 and 53 of the exposition; similarly in\nTieftrunk’s “_Denklehre in rein Deutschem Gewande_” (1825). It there\nappears so clearly how those disciples who do not themselves think become\na magnifying mirror of the errors of every thinker. Once having determined\nhis doctrine of the categories, Kant was always cautious when expounding\nit, but his disciples on the contrary were quite bold, and thus exposed\nits falseness.\n\nAccording to what has been said, the object of the categories is for Kant,\nnot indeed the thing in itself, but yet most closely akin to it. It is the\n_object in itself_; it is an object that requires no subject; it is a\nparticular thing, and yet not in space and time, because not perceptible;\nit is an object of thought, and yet not an abstract conception.\nAccordingly Kant really makes a triple division: (1.) the idea; (2.) the\nobject of the idea; (3.) the thing in itself. The first belongs to the\nsensibility, which in its case, as in that of sensation, includes the pure\nforms of perception, space and time. The second belongs to the\nunderstanding, which thinks it through its twelve categories. The third\nlies beyond the possibility of all knowledge. (In support of this, _cf._\nCritique of Pure Reason, first edition, p. 108 and 109.) The distinction\nof the idea from the object of the idea is however unfounded; this had\nalready been proved by Berkeley, and it appears from my whole exposition\nin the first book, especially chap. i. of the supplements; nay, even from\nKant’s own completely idealistic point of view in the first edition. But\nif we should not wish to count the object of the idea as belonging to the\nidea and identify it with the idea, it would be necessary to attribute it\nto the thing in itself: this ultimately depends on the sense which is\nattached to the word object. This, however, always remains certain, that,\nwhen we think clearly, nothing more can be found than idea and thing in\nitself. The illicit introduction of that hybrid, the object of the idea,\nis the source of Kant’s errors; yet when it is taken away, the doctrine of\nthe categories as conceptions _a priori_ also falls to the ground; for\nthey bring nothing to the perception, and are not supposed to hold good of\nthe thing in itself, but by means of them we only think those “objects of\nthe ideas,” and thereby change ideas into experience. For every empirical\nperception is already experience; but every perception which proceeds from\nsensation is empirical: this sensation is related by the understanding, by\nmeans of its sole function (knowledge _a priori_ of the law of causality),\nto its cause, which just on this account presents itself in space and time\n(forms of pure perception) as object of experience, material object,\nenduring in space through all time, yet as such always remains idea, as do\nspace and time themselves. If we desire to go beyond this idea, then we\narrive at the question as to the thing in itself, the answer to which is\nthe theme of my whole work, as of all metaphysics in general. Kant’s error\nhere explained is connected with his mistake, which we condemned before,\nthat he gives no theory of the origin of empirical perception, but,\nwithout saying more, treats it as _given_, identifying it with the mere\nsensation, to which he only adds the forms of intuition or perception,\nspace and time, comprehending both under the name sensibility. But from\nthese materials no objective idea arises: this absolutely demands the\nrelation of the idea to its cause, thus the application of the law of\ncausality, and thus understanding; for without this the sensation still\nremains always subjective, and does not take the form of an object in\nspace, even if space is given with it. But according to Kant, the\nunderstanding must not be assigned to perception; it is supposed merely to\n_think_, so as to remain within the transcendental logic. With this again\nis connected another mistake of Kant’s: that he left it to me to adduce\nthe only valid proof of the _a priori_ nature of the law of causality\nwhich he rightly recognised, the proof from the possibility of objective\nempirical perception itself, and instead of it gives a palpably false one,\nas I have already shown in my essay on the principle of sufficient reason,",

    "page_content": "made up of what he has stolen partly from the idea (1), and partly from\nthe thing in itself (3). If, in reality, experience were only brought\nabout by the understanding applying its twelve different functions in\norder to _think_ through as many conceptions _a priori_, the objects which\nwere previously merely perceived, then every real thing would necessarily\nas such have a number of determinations, which, as given _a priori_,\nabsolutely could not be thought away, just like space and time, but would\nbelong quite essentially to the existence of the thing, and yet could not\nbe deduced from the properties of space and time. But only one such\ndetermination is to be found—that of causality. Upon this rests\nmateriality, for the essence of matter consists in action, and it is\nthrough and through causality (_cf._ Bk. II. ch. iv.) But it is\nmateriality alone that distinguishes the real thing from the picture of\nthe imagination, which is then only idea. For matter, as permanent, gives\nto the thing permanence through all time, in respect of its matter, while\nthe forms change in conformity with causality. Everything else in the\nthing consists either of determinations of space or of time, or of its\nempirical properties, which are all referable to its activity, and are\nthus fuller determinations of causality. But causality enters already as a\ncondition into the empirical perception, and this is accordingly a thing\nof the understanding, which makes even perception possible, and yet apart\nfrom the law of causality contributes nothing to experience and its\npossibility. What fills the old ontologies is, with the exception of what\nis given here, nothing more than relations of things to each other, or to\nour reflection, and a farrago of nonsense.\n\nThe language in which the doctrine of the categories is expressed affords\nan evidence of its baselessness. What a difference in this respect between\nthe Transcendental Æsthetic and the Transcendental Analytic! In the\nformer, what clearness, definiteness, certainty, firm conviction which is\nfreely expressed and infallibly communicates itself! All is full of light,\nno dark lurking-places are left: Kant knows what he wants and knows that\nhe is right. In the latter, on the other hand, all is obscure, confused,\nindefinite, wavering, uncertain, the language anxious, full of excuses and\nappeals to what is coming, or indeed of suppression. Moreover, the whole\nsecond and third sections of the Deduction of the Pure Conceptions of the\nUnderstanding are completely changed in the second edition, because they\ndid not satisfy Kant himself, and they have become quite different from\nthe first edition, though not clearer. We actually see Kant in conflict\nwith the truth in order to carry out his hypothesis which he has once\nfixed upon. In the Transcendental Æsthetic all his propositions are really\nproved from undeniable facts of consciousness, in the Transcendental\nAnalytic, on the contrary, we find, if we consider it closely, mere\nassertions that thus it is and must be. Here, then, as everywhere, the\nlanguage bears the stamp of the thought from which it has proceeded, for\nstyle is the physiognomy of the mind. We have still to remark, that\nwhenever Kant wishes to give an example for the purpose of fuller\nexplanation, he almost always takes for this end the category of\ncausality, and then what he has said turns out correct; for the law of\ncausality is indeed the real form of the understanding, but it is also its\nonly form, and the remaining eleven categories are merely blind windows.\nThe deduction of the categories is simpler and less involved in the first\nedition than in the second. He labours to explain how, according to the\nperception given by sensibility, the understanding produces experience by\nmeans of thinking the categories. In doing so, the words recognition,\nreproduction, association, apprehension, transcendental unity of\napperception, are repeated to weariness, and yet no distinctness is\nattained. It is well worth noticing, however, that in this explanation he\ndoes not once touch upon what must nevertheless first occur to every\none—the relation of the sensation to its external cause. If he did not\nintend this relation to hold good, he ought to have expressly denied it;\nbut neither does he do this. Thus in this way he evades the point, and all\nthe Kantians have in like manner evaded it. The secret motive of this is,\nthat he reserves the causal nexus, under the name “ground of the\nphenomenon,” for his false deduction of the thing in itself; and also that\nperception would become intellectual through the relation to the cause,\nwhich he dare not admit. Besides this, he seems to have been afraid that\nif the causal nexus were allowed to hold good between sensation and\nobject, the latter would at once become the thing in itself, and introduce\nthe empiricism of Locke. But this difficulty is removed by reflection,\nwhich shows us that the law of causality is of subjective origin, as well\nas the sensation itself; and besides this, our own body also, inasmuch as\nit appears in space, already belongs to ideas. But Kant was hindered from\nconfessing this by his fear of the Berkeleian idealism.\n\n“The combination of the manifold of perception” is repeatedly given as the\nessential operation of the understanding, by means of its twelve\ncategories. Yet this is never adequately explained, nor is it shown what\nthis manifold of perception is before it is combined by the understanding.\nBut time and space, the latter in all its three dimensions, are\n_continua_, _i.e._, all their parts are originally not separate but\ncombined. Thus, then, everything that exhibits itself in them (is given)\nappears originally as a _continuum_, _i.e._, its parts appear already\ncombined and require no adventitious combination of a manifold. If,\nhowever, some one should seek to interpret that combining of the manifold\nof perception by saying that I refer the different sense-impressions of\none object to this one only—thus, for example, perceiving a bell, I\nrecognise that what affects my eye as yellow, my hand as smooth and hard,\nmy ear as sounding, is yet only one and the same body,—then I reply that\nthis is rather a consequence of the knowledge _a priori_ of the causal\nnexus (this actual and only function of the understanding), by virtue of\nwhich all those different effects upon my different organs of sense yet\nlead me only to one common cause of them, the nature of the body standing\nbefore me, so that my understanding, in spite of the difference and\nmultiplicity of the effects, still apprehends the unity of the cause as a\nsingle object, which just on that account exhibits itself in perception.\nIn the beautiful recapitulation of his doctrine which Kant gives at p.\n719-726 or V. 747-754 of the “Critique of Pure Reason,” he explains the\ncategories, perhaps more distinctly than anywhere else, as “the mere rule\nof the synthesis of that which empirical apprehension has given _a\nposteriori_.” It seems as if here he had something in his mind, such as\nthat, in the construction of the triangle, the angles give the rule for\nthe composition of the lines; at least by this image one can best explain\nto oneself what he says of the function of the categories. The \n\nAfter repeated study of the “Critique of Pure Reason” at different periods\nof my life, a conviction has forced itself upon me with regard to the\norigin of the Transcendental Logic, which I now impart as very helpful to\nan understanding of it. Kant’s only discovery, which is based upon\nobjective comprehension and the highest human thought, is the _apperçu_\nthat time and space are known by us _a priori_. Gratified by this happy\nhit, he wished to pursue the same vein further, and his love of\narchitectonic symmetry afforded him the clue. As he had found that a pure\nintuition or perception _a priori_ underlay the empirical _perception_ as\nits condition, he thought that in the same way certain _pure conceptions_\nas presuppositions in our faculty of knowledge must lie at the foundation\nof the empirically obtained _conceptions_, and that real empirical thought\nmust be only possible through a pure thought _a priori_, which, however,\nwould have no objects in itself, but would be obliged to take them from\nperception. So that as the _Transcendental Æsthetic_ establishes an _a\npriori_ basis of mathematics, there must, he supposed, also be a similar\nbasis for logic; and thus, then for the sake of symmetry, the former\nreceived a pendant in a _Transcendental Logic_. From this point onwards\nKant was no more free, no more in the position of purely, investigating\nand observing what is present in consciousness; but he was guided by an\nassumption and pursued a purpose—the purpose of finding what he assumed,\nin order to add to the Transcendental Æsthetic so happily discovered a\nTranscendental Logic analogous to it, and thus symmetrically corresponding\nto it, as a second storey. Now for this purpose he hit upon the table of\njudgments, out of which he constructed, as well as he could, the table of\ncategories, the doctrine of twelve pure _a priori_ conceptions, which are\nsupposed to be the conditions of our _thinking_ those very _things_ the\n_perception_ of which is conditioned by the two _a priori_ forms of\nsensibility: thus a _pure understanding_ now corresponded symmetrically to\na _pure sensibility_. Then another consideration occurred to him, which\noffered a means of increasing the plausibility of the thing, by the\nassumption of the _schematism_ of the pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding. But just through this the way in which his procedure had,\nunconsciously indeed, originated betrayed itself most distinctly. For\nbecause he aimed at finding something _a priori_ analogous to every\nempirical function of the faculty of knowledge, he remarked that between\nour empirical perception and our empirical thinking, conducted in abstract\nnon-perceptible conceptions, a connection very frequently, though not\nalways, takes place, because every now and then we try to go back from\nabstract thinking to perception; but try to do so merely in order really\nto convince ourselves that our abstract thought has not strayed far from\nthe safe ground of perception, and perhaps become exaggeration, or, it may\nbe, mere empty talk; much in the same way as, when we are walking in the\ndark, we stretch out our hand every now and then to the guiding wall. We\ngo back, then, to the perception only tentatively and for the moment, by\ncalling up in imagination a perception corresponding to the conceptions\nwhich are occupying us at the time—a perception which can yet never be\nquite adequate to the conception, but is merely a temporary\n_representative_ of it. I have already adduced what is needful on this\npoint in my essay on the principle of sufficient reason,",

    "page_content": "a fleeting phantasy of this kind a schema, in opposition to the perfected\npicture of the imagination. He says it is like a monogram of the\nimagination, and asserts that just as such a schema stands midway between\nour abstract thinking of empirically obtained conceptions, and our clear\nperception which comes to us through the senses, so there are _a priori\nschemata of the pure conceptions of the understanding_ between the faculty\nof perception _a priori_ of pure sensibility and the faculty of thinking\n_a priori_ of the pure understanding (thus the categories). These\nschemata, as monograms of the pure imagination _a priori_, he describes\none by one, and assigns to each of them its corresponding category, in the\nwonderful “Chapter on the Schematism of the Pure Conceptions of the\nUnderstanding,” which is noted as exceedingly obscure, because no man has\never been able to make anything out of it. Its obscurity, however,\nvanishes if it is considered from the point of view here indicated, but\nthere also comes out more clearly in it than anywhere else the intentional\nnature of Kant’s procedure, and of the determination formed beforehand of\nfinding what would correspond to the analogy, and could assist the\narchitectonic symmetry; indeed this is here the case to such a degree as\nto be almost comical. For when he assumes schemata of the pure (empty) _a\npriori_ conceptions of the understanding (categories) analogous to the\nempirical schemata (or representatives through the fancy of our actual\nconceptions), he overlooks the fact that the end of such schemata is here\nentirely wanting, For the end of the schemata in the case of empirical\n(real) thinking is entirely connected with the _material content_ of such\nconceptions. For since these conceptions are drawn from empirical\nperception, we assist and guide ourselves when engaged in abstract\nthinking by now and then casting a momentary glance back at the perception\nout of which the conceptions are framed, in order to assure ourselves that\nour thought has still real content. This, however, necessarily presupposes\nthat the conceptions which occupy us are sprung from perception, and it is\nmerely a glance back at their material content, indeed a mere aid to our\nweakness. But in the case of _a priori_ conceptions which as yet have no\ncontent at all, clearly this is necessarily omitted. For these conceptions\nare not sprung from perception, but come to it from within, in order to\nreceive a content first from it. Thus they have as yet nothing on which\nthey could look back. I speak fully upon this point, because it is just\nthis that throws light upon the secret origin of the Kantian\nphilosophising, which accordingly consists in this, that Kant, after the\nhappy discovery of the two forms of intuition or perception _a priori_,\nexerted himself, under the guidance of the analogy, to prove that for\nevery determination of our empirical knowledge there is an _a priori_\nanalogue, and this finally extended, in the schemata, even to a mere\npsychological fact. Here the apparent depth and the difficulty of the\nexposition just serve to conceal from the reader that its content remains\na wholly undemonstrable and merely arbitrary assumption. But he who has\npenetrated at last to the meaning of such an exposition is then easily\ninduced to mistake this understanding so painfully attained for a\nconviction of the truth of the matter. If, on the contrary, Kant had kept\nhimself here as unprejudiced and purely observant as in the discovery of\n_a priori_ intuition or perception, he must have found that what is added\nto the pure intuition or perception of space and time, if an empirical\nperception arises from it, is on the one hand the sensation, and on the\nother hand the knowledge of causality, which changes the mere sensation\ninto objective empirical perception, but just on this account is not first\nderived and learned from sensation, but exists _a priori_, and is indeed\nthe form and function of the pure understanding. It is also, however, its\nsole form and function, yet one so rich in results that all our empirical\nknowledge rests upon it. If, as has often been said, the refutation of an\nerror is only complete when the way it originated has been psychologically\ndemonstrated, I believe I have achieved this, with regard to Kant’s\ndoctrine of the categories and their schemata, in what I have said above.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nAfter Kant had thus introduced such great errors into the first simple\noutlines of a theory of the faculty of perception, he adopted a variety of\nvery complicated assumptions. To these belongs first of all the synthetic\nunity of apperception: a very strange thing, very strangely explained.\n“The _I think_ must be able to accompany all my ideas.” Must—be able: this\nis a problematic-apodictic enunciation; in plain English, a proposition\nwhich takes with one hand what it gives with the other. And what is the\nmeaning of this carefully balanced proposition? That all knowledge of\nideas is thinking? That is not the case: and it would be dreadful; there\nwould then be nothing but abstract conceptions, or at any rate a pure\nperception free from reflection and will, such as that of the beautiful,\nthe deepest comprehension of the true nature of things, _i.e._, of their\nPlatonic Ideas. And besides, the brutes would then either think also, or\nelse they would not even have ideas. Or is the proposition perhaps\nintended to mean: no object without a subject? That would be very badly\nexpressed by it, and would come too late. If we collect Kant’s utterances\non the subject, we shall find that what he understands by the synthetic\nunity of apperception is, as it were, the extensionless centre of the\nsphere of all our ideas, whose radii converge to it. It is what I call the\nsubject of knowing, the correlative of all ideas, and it is also that\nwhich I have fully described and explained in the 22d chapter of the\nSupplements, as the focus in which the rays of the activity of the brain\nconverge. Therefore, to avoid repetition, I now refer to that chapter.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nThat I reject the whole doctrine of the categories, and reckon it among\nthe groundless assumptions with which Kant burdened the theory of\nknowledge, results from the criticism given above; and also from the proof\nof the contradictions in the Transcendental Logic, which had their ground\nin the confusion of perception and abstract knowledge; also further from\nthe proof of the want of a distinct and definite conception of the nature\nof the understanding and of the reason, instead of which we found in\nKant’s writings only incoherent, inconsistent, insufficient, and incorrect\nutterances with regard to these two faculties of the mind. Finally, it\nresults from the explanations which I myself have given of these faculties\nof the mind in the first book and its Supplements, and more fully in the\nessay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 21, 26, and\n34,—explanations which are very definite and distinct, which clearly\nfollow from the consideration of the nature of our knowledge, and which\ncompletely agree with the conceptions of those two faculties of knowledge\nthat appear in the language and writings of all ages and all nations, but\nwere not brought to distinctness. Their defence against the very different\nexposition of Kant has, for the most part, been given already along with\nthe exposure of the errors of that exposition. Since, however, the table\nof judgments, which Kant makes the foundation of his theory of thinking,\nand indeed of his whole philosophy, has, in itself, as a whole, its\ncorrectness, it is still incumbent upon me to show how these universal\nforms of all judgment arise in our faculty of knowledge, and to reconcile\nthem with my exposition of it. In this discussion I shall always attach to\nthe concepts understanding and reason the sense given them in my\nexplanation, which I therefore assume the reader is familiar with.\n\nAn essential difference between Kant’s method and that which I follow lies\nin this, that he starts from indirect, reflected knowledge, while I start\nfrom direct or intuitive knowledge. He may be compared to a man who\nmeasures the height of a tower by its shadow, while I am like him who\napplies the measuring-rule directly to the tower itself. Therefore, for\nhim philosophy is a science _of_ conceptions, but for me it is a science\n_in_ conceptions, drawn from knowledge of perception, the one source of\nall evidence, and comprehended and made permanent in general conceptions.\nHe passes over this whole world of perception which surrounds us, so\nmultifarious and rich in significance, and confines himself to the forms\nof abstract thinking; and, although he never expressly says so, this\nprocedure is founded on the assumption that reflection is the ectype of\nall perception, that, therefore, all that is essential in perception must\nbe expressed in reflection, and expressed in very contracted forms and\noutlines, which are thus easily surveyed. According to this, what is\nessential and conformable to law in abstract knowledge would, as it were,\nplace in our hands all the threads by which the varied puppet-show of the\nworld of perception is set in motion before our eyes. If Kant had only\ndistinctly expressed this first principle of his method, and then followed\nit consistently, he would at least have been obliged to separate clearly\nthe intuitive from the abstract, and we would not have had to contend with\ninextricable contradictions and confusions. But from the way in which he\nsolves his problem we see that that fundamental principle of his method\nwas only very indistinctly present to his mind, and thus we have still to\narrive at it by conjecture even after a thorough study of his philosophy.\n\nNow as concerns the specified method and fundamental maxim itself, there\nis much to be said for it, and it is a brilliant thought. The nature of\nall science indeed consists in this, that we comprehend the endless\nmanifold of perceptible phenomena under comparatively few abstract\nconceptions, and out of these construct a system by means of which we have\nall those phenomena completely in the power of our knowledge, can explain\nthe past and determine the future. The sciences, however, divide the wide\nsphere of phenomena among them according to the special and manifold\nclasses of the latter. Now it was a bold and happy thought to isolate what\nis absolutely essential to the conceptions as such and apart from their\ncontent, in order to discover from these forms of all thought found in\nthis way what is essential to all intuitive knowledge also, and\nconsequently to the world as phenomenon in general; and because this would\nbe found _a priori_ on account of the necessity of those forms of thought,\nit would be of subjective origin, and would just lead to the ends Kant had\nin view. Here, however, before going further, the relation of reflection\nto knowledge of perception ought to have been investigated (which\ncertainly presupposes the clear separation of the two, which was neglected\nby Kant). He ought to have inquired in what way the former really repeats\nand represents the latter, whether quite pure, or changed and to some\nextent disguised by being taken up into its special forms (forms of\nreflection); whether the form of abstract reflective knowledge becomes\nmore determined through the form of knowledge of perception, or through\nthe nature or constitution which unalterably belongs to itself, _i.e._, to\nreflective knowledge, so that even what is very heterogeneous in intuitive\nknowledge can no longer be distinguished when it has entered reflective\nknowledge, and conversely many distinctions of which we are conscious in\nthe reflective method of knowledge have also sprung from this knowledge\nitself, and by no means point to corresponding differences in intuitive\nknowledge. As the result of this investigation, however, it would have\nappeared that knowledge of perception suffers very nearly as much change\nwhen it is taken up into reflection as food when it is taken into the\nanimal organism whose forms and compounds are determined by itself, so\nthat the nature of the food can no longer be recognised from the result\nthey produce. Or (for this is going a little too far) at least it would\nhave appeared that reflection is by no means related to knowledge of\nperception as the reflection in water is related to the reflected objects,\nbut scarcely even as the mere shadow of these objects stands to the\nobjects themselves; which shadow repeats only a few external outlines, but\nalso unites the most manifold in the same form and presents the most\ndiverse through the same outline; so that it is by no means possible,\nstarting from it, to construe the forms of things with completeness and\ncertainty.\n\nThe whole of reflective knowledge, or the reason, has only one chief form,\nand that is the abstract conception. It is proper to the reason itself,\nand has no direct necessary connection with the world of perception, which\ntherefore exists for the brutes entirely without conceptions, and indeed,\neven if it were quite another world from what it is, that form of\nreflection would suit it just as well. But the combination of conceptions\nfor the purpose of judging has certain definite and normal forms, which\nhave been found by induction, and constitute the table of judgments. These\nforms are for the most part deducible from the nature of reflective\nknowledge itself, thus directly from the reason, because they spring from\nthe four laws of thought (called by me metalogical truths) and the _dictum\nde omni et nullo_. Certain others of these forms, however, have their\nground in the nature of knowledge of perception, thus in the\nunderstanding; yet they by no means point to a like number of special\nforms of the understanding, but can all be fully deduced from the sole\nfunction which the understanding has—the direct knowledge of cause and\neffect. Lastly, still others of these forms have sprung from the\nconcurrence and combination of the reflective and intuitive modes of\nknowledge, or more properly from the assumption of the latter into the\nformer. I shall now go through the moments of the judgment one by one, and\npoint out the origin of each of them in the sources referred to; and from\nthis it follows of itself that a deduction of categories from them is\nwanting, and the assumption of this is just as groundless as its\nexposition was found to be entangled and self-conflicting.\n\n1. The so-called _Quantity_ of judgments springs from the nature of\nconcepts as such. It thus has its ground in the reason alone, and has\nabsolutely no direct connection with the understanding and with knowledge\nof perception. It is indeed, as is explained at length in the first book,\nessential to concepts, as such, that they should have an extent, a sphere,\nand the wider, less determined concept includes the narrower and more\ndetermined. The latter can therefore be separated from the former, and\nthis may happen in two ways,—either the narrower concept may be indicated\nas an indefinite part of the wider concept in general, or it may be\ndefined and completely separated by means of the addition of a special\nname. The judgment which carries out this operation is in the first case\ncalled a particular, and in the second case an universal judgment. For\nexample, one and the same part of the sphere of the concept tree may be\nisolated through a particular and through an universal judgment,\nthus—“Some trees bear gall-nuts,” or “All oaks bear gall-nuts.” One sees\nthat the difference of the two operations is very slight; indeed, that the\npossibility of it depends upon the richness of the language. Nevertheless,\nKant has explained this difference as disclosing two fundamentally\ndifferent actions, functions, categories of the pure understanding which\ndetermines experience _a priori_ through them.\n\nFinally, a concept may also be used in order to arrive by means of it at a\ndefinite particular idea of perception, from which, as well as from many\nothers, this concept itself is drawn; this happens in the singular\njudgment. Such a judgment merely indicates the boundary-line between\nabstract knowledge and knowledge of perception, and passes directly to the\nlatter, “This tree here bears gall-nuts.” Kant has made of this also a\nspecial category.\n\nAfter all that has been said there is no need of further polemic here.\n\n2. In the same way the _Quality_ of the judgment lies entirely within the\nprovince of reason, and is not an adumbration of any law of that\nunderstanding which makes perception possible, _i.e._, it does not point\nto it. The nature of abstract concepts, which is just the nature of the\nreason itself objectively comprehended, carries with it the possibility of\nuniting and separating their spheres, as was already explained in the\nfirst book, and upon this possibility, as their presupposition, rest the\nuniversal laws of thought of identity and contradiction, to which I have\ngiven the name of _metalogical_ truths, because they spring purely from\nthe reason, and cannot be further explained. They determine that what is\nunited must remain united, and what is separated must remain separate,\nthus that what is established cannot at the same time be also abolished,\nand thus they presuppose the possibility of the combination and separation\nof spheres, _i.e._, of judgment. This, however, lies, according to its\n_form_, simply and solely in the reason, and this _form_ has not, like the\n_content_ of the judgments, been brought over from the perceptible\nknowledge of the understanding, and therefore there is no correlative or\nanalogue of it to be looked for there. After the perception has been\nbrought about through the understanding and for the understanding, it\nexists complete, subject to no doubt nor error, and therefore knows\nneither assertion nor denial; for it expresses itself, and has not, like\nthe abstract knowledge of the reason, its value and content in its mere\nrelation to something outside of it, according to the principle of the\nground of knowing. It is, therefore, pure reality; all negation is foreign\nto its nature, can only be added on through reflection, and just on this\naccount remains always in the province of abstract thought.\n\nTo the affirmative and negative Kant adds the infinite judgment, making\nuse of a crotchet of the old scholastics, an ingeniously invented\nstop-gap, which does not even require to be explained, a blind window,\nsuch as many others he made for the sake of his architectonic symmetry.\n\n3. Under the very wide conception of _Relation_ Kant has brought three\nentirely different properties of judgments, which we must, therefore,\nexamine singly, in order to recognise their origin.\n\n(_a._) The _hypothetical judgment_ in general is the abstract expression\nof that most universal form of all our knowledge, the principle of\nsufficient reason. In my essay on this principle, I already showed in 1813\nthat it has four entirely different meanings, and in each of these\noriginally originates in a different faculty of knowledge, and also\nconcerns a different class of ideas. It clearly follows from this, that\nthe source of the hypothetical judgment in general, of that universal form\nof thought, cannot be, as Kant wishes to make it, merely the understanding\nand its category of causality; but that the law of causality which,\naccording to my exposition, is the one form of knowledge of the pure\nunderstanding, is only one of the forms of that principle which embraces\nall pure or _a priori_ knowledge—the principle of sufficient reason—which,\non the other hand, in each of its meanings has this hypothetical form of\njudgment as its expression. We see here, however, very distinctly how\nkinds of knowledge which are quite different in their origin and\nsignificance yet appear, if thought _in abstracto_ by the reason, in one\nand the same form of combination of concepts and judgments, and then in\nthis form can no longer be distinguished, but, in order to distinguish\nthem, we must go back to knowledge of perception, leaving abstract\nknowledge altogether. Therefore the path which was followed by Kant,\nstarting from the point of view of abstract knowledge, to find the\nelements and the inmost spring of intuitive knowledge also, was quite a\nwrong one. For the rest, my whole introductory essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason is, to a certain extent, to be regarded merely as a\nthorough exposition of the significance of the hypothetical form of\njudgment; therefore I do not dwell upon it longer here.\n\n(_b._) The form of the _categorical judgment_ is nothing but the form of\njudgment in general, in its strictest sense. For, strictly speaking,\njudging merely means thinking, the combination of, or the impossibility of\ncombining, the spheres of the concepts. Therefore the hypothetical and the\ndisjunctive combination are properly no special forms of the judgment; for\nthey are only applied to already completed judgments, in which the\ncombination of the concepts remains unchanged the categorical. But they\nagain connect these judgments, for the hypothetical form expresses their\ndependence upon each other, and the disjunctive their incompatibility.\nMere concepts, however, have only _one_ class of relations to each other,\nthose which are expressed in the categorical judgment. The fuller\ndetermination, or the sub-species of this relation, are the intersection\nand the complete separateness of the concept-spheres, _i.e._, thus\naffirmation and negation; out of which Kant has made special categories,\nunder quite a different title, that of _quality_. Intersection and\nseparateness have again sub-species, according as the spheres lie within\neach other entirely, or only in part, a determination which constitutes\nthe _quantity_ of the judgments; out of which Kant has again made a quite\nspecial class of categories. Thus he separates what is very closely\nrelated, and even identical, the easily surveyed modifications of the one\npossible relation of mere concepts to each other, and, on the other hand,\nunites what is very different under this title of relation.\n\nCategorical judgments have as their metalogical principle the laws of\nthought of identity and contradiction. But the _ground_ of the connection\nof the concept-spheres which gives _truth_ to the judgment, which is\nnothing but this connection, may be of very different kinds; and,\naccording to this, the truth of the judgment is either logical, or\nempirical, or metaphysical, or metalogical, as is explained in the\nintroductory essay, § 30-33, and does not require to be repeated here. But\nit is apparent from this how very various the direct cognitions may be,\nall of which exhibit themselves in the abstract, through the combination\nof the spheres of two concepts, as subject and predicate, and that we can\nby no means set up the sole function of the understanding as corresponding\nto them and producing them. For example, the judgments, “Water boils, the\nsine measures the angle, the will resolves, business distracts,\ndistinction is difficult,” express through the same logical form the most\ndifferent kinds of relations; but from this we obtain the right, however\nirregular the beginning may be, of placing ourselves at the standpoint of\nabstract knowledge to analyse direct intuitive knowledge. For the rest,\nthe categorical judgment springs from knowledge of the understanding\nproper, in my sense, only when causation is expressed by it; this is,\nhowever, the case in all judgments which refer to a physical quality. For\nif I say, “This body is heavy, hard, fluid, green, sour, alkaline,\norganic, &c., &c.,” this always refers to its effect, and thus is\nknowledge which is only possible through the pure understanding. Now,\nafter this, like much which is quite different from it (for example, the\nsubordination of very abstract concepts), has been expressed in the\nabstract through subject and predicate, these mere relations of concepts\nhave been transferred back to knowledge of perception, and it has been\nsupposed that the subject and predicate of the judgment must have a\npeculiar and special correlative in perception, substance and accident.\nBut I shall show clearly further on that the conception substance has no\nother true content than that of the conception matter. Accidents, however,\nare quite synonymous with kinds of effects, so that the supposed knowledge\nof substance and accident is never anything more than the knowledge of\ncause and effect by the understanding. But the special manner in which the\nidea of matter arises is explained partly in § 4 of the first book, and\nstill more clearly in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason at\nthe end of § 21, p. 77 (3d ed., p. 82), and in some respects we shall see\nit still more closely when we investigate the principle of the permanence\nof substance.\n\n(_c._) _Disjunctive judgments_ spring from the law of thought of excluded\nthird, which is a metalogical truth; they are, therefore, entirely the\nproperty of the reason, and have not their origin in the understanding.\nThe deduction of the category of community or _reciprocity_ from them is,\nhowever, a glaring example of the violence which Kant sometimes allowed to\nbe done to truth, merely in order to satisfy his love of architectonic\nsymmetry. The illegitimacy of that deduction has already often been justly\ncondemned and proved upon various grounds, especially by G. E. Schulze in\nhis “_Kritik der theoretischen Philosophie_,” and by Berg in his\n“_Epikritik der Philosophie_.” What real analogy is there, indeed, between\nthe problematical determination of a concept by disjunctive predicates and\nthe thought of reciprocity? The two are indeed absolutely opposed, for in\nthe disjunctive judgment the actual affirmation of one of the two\nalternative propositions is also necessarily the negation of the other;\nif, on the other hand, we think two things in the relation of reciprocity,\nthe affirmation of one is also necessarily the affirmation of the other,\nand _vice versa_. Therefore, unquestionably, the real logical analogue of\nreciprocity is the vicious circle, for in it, as nominally in the case of\nreciprocity, what is proved is also the proof, and conversely. And just as\nlogic rejects the vicious circle, so the conception of reciprocity ought\nto be banished from metaphysics. For I now intend, quite seriously, to\nprove that there is no reciprocity in the strict sense, and this\nconception, which people are so fond of using, just on account of the\nindefiniteness of the thought, is seen, if more closely considered, to be\nempty, false, and invalid. First of all, the reader must call to mind what\ncausality really is, and to assist my exposition, see upon this subject §\n20 of the introductory essay, also my prize-essay on the freedom of the\nwill, chap. iii. p. 27 _seq._, and lastly the fourth chapter of the second\nbook of this work. Causality is the law according to which the conditions\nor states of matter which appear determine their position in time.\nCausality has to do merely with conditions or states, indeed, properly,\nonly with _changes_, and neither with matter as such, nor with permanence\nwithout change. _Matter_, as such, does not come under the law of\ncausality, for it neither comes into being nor passes away; thus neither\ndoes the whole _thing_, as we commonly express ourselves, come under this\nlaw, but only the _conditions_ or _states_ of matter. Further, the law of\ncausality has nothing to do with _permanence_, for where nothing changes\nthere is no producing of _effects_ and no causality, but a continuing\nquiet condition or state. But if, now, such a state is changed, then the\nnew state is either again permanent or it is not, but immediately\nintroduces a third state, and the necessity with which this happens is\njust the law of causality, which is a form of the principle of sufficient\nreason, and therefore cannot be further explained, because the principle\nof sufficient reason is the principle of all explanation and of all\nnecessity. From this it is clear that cause and effect stand in intimate\nconnection with, and necessary relation to, the _course of time_. Only\nbecause the state A. precedes in time the state B., and their succession\nis necessary and not accidental, _i.e._, no mere sequence but a\nconsequence—only because of this is the state A. cause and the state B.\neffect. The conception _reciprocity_, however, contains this, that both\nare cause and both are effect of each other; but this really amounts to\nsaying that each of the two is the earlier and also the later; thus it is\nan absurdity. For that both states are simultaneous, and indeed\nnecessarily simultaneous, cannot be admitted, because, as necessarily\nbelonging to each other and existing at the same time, they constitute\nonly _one_ state. For the permanence of this state there is certainly\nrequired the continued existence of all its determinations, but we are\nthen no longer concerned with change and causality, but with duration and\nrest, and nothing further is said than that if _one_ determination of the\nwhole state be changed, the new state which then appears cannot continue,\nbut becomes the cause of the change of all the other determinations of the\nfirst state, so that a new third state appears; which all happens merely\nin accordance with the simple law of causality, and does not establish a\n_new_ law, that of reciprocity.\n\nI also definitely assert that the conception _reciprocity_ cannot be\nsupported by a single example. Everything that one seeks to pass off as\nsuch is either a state of rest, to which the conception of causality,\nwhich has only significance with reference to changes, finds no\napplication at all, or else it is an alternating succession of states of\nthe same name which condition each other, for the explanation of which\nsimple causality is quite sufficient. An example of the first class is\nafforded by a pair of scales brought to rest by equal weights. Here there\nis no effect produced, for there is no change; it is a state of rest;\ngravity acts, equally divided, as in every body which is supported at its\ncentre of gravity, but it cannot show its force by any effect. That the\ntaking away of one weight produces a second state, which at once becomes\nthe cause of the third, the sinking of the other scale, happens according\nto the simple law of cause and effect, and requires no special category of\nthe understanding, and not even a special name. An example of the second\nclass is the continuous burning of a fire. The combination of oxygen with\nthe combustible body is the cause of heat, and heat, again, is the cause\nof the renewed occurrence of the chemical combination. But this is nothing\nmore than a chain of causes and effects, the links of which have\nalternately _the same name_. The burning, A., produces free heat, B., this\nproduces new burning, C. (_i.e._, a new effect which has the same name as\nthe cause A., but is not individually identical with it), this produces\nnew heat, D. (which is not really identical with the effect B., but only\naccording to the concept, _i.e._, it has the same name), and so on\nindefinitely. A good example of what in ordinary life is called\nreciprocity is afforded by a theory about deserts given by Humboldt\n(_Ansichten der Natur_, 2d ed., vol. ii. p. 79). In the sandy deserts it\ndoes not rain, but it rains upon the wooded mountains surrounding them.\nThe cause is not the attraction of the clouds by the mountains; but it is\nthe column of heated air rising from the sandy plain which prevents the\nparticles of vapour from condensing, and drives the clouds high into the\nheavens. On the mountains the perpendicular rising stream of air is\nweaker, the clouds descend, and the rainfall ensues in the cooler air.\nThus, want of rain and the absence of plants in the desert stand in the\nrelation of reciprocity; it does not rain because the heated sand-plain\nsends out more heat; the desert does not become a steppe or prairie\nbecause it does not rain. But clearly we have here again, as in the\nexample given above, only a succession of causes and effects of the same\nnames, and throughout nothing essentially different from simple causality.\nThis is also the case with the swinging of the pendulum, and indeed also\nwith the self-conservation of the organised body, in which case likewise\nevery state introduces a new one, which is of the same kind as that by\nwhich it was itself brought about, but individually is new. Only here the\nmatter is complicated, because the chain no longer consists of links of\ntwo kinds, but of many kinds, so that a link of the same name only recurs\nafter several others have intervened. But we always see before us only an\napplication of the single and simple law of causality which gives the rule\nto the sequence of states, but never anything which must be comprehended\nby means of a new and special function of the understanding.\n\nOr is it perhaps advanced in support of the conception of reciprocity that\naction and reaction are equal? But the reason of this is what I urge so\nstrongly and have fully explained in the essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason, that the cause and the effect are not two bodies, but\ntwo successive states of bodies, consequently each of the two states\nimplicates all bodies concerned; thus the effect, _i.e._, the newly\nappearing state, for example, in the case of an impulse, extends to both\nbodies in the same proportion; therefore the body impelled produces just\nas great a change in the body impelling as it itself sustains (each in\nproportion to its mass and velocity). If one pleases to call this\nreciprocity, then absolutely every effect is a reciprocal effect, and no\nnew conception is introduced on this account, still less does it require a\nnew function of the understanding, but we only have a superfluous synonym\nfor causality. But Kant himself, in a moment of thoughtlessness, exactly\nexpressed this view in the “Metaphysical First Principles of Natural\nScience” at the beginning of the proof of the fourth principle of\nmechanics: “All external effect in the world is reciprocal effect.” How\nthen should different functions lie _a priori_ in the understanding for\nsimple causality and for reciprocity, and, indeed, how should the real\nsuccession of things only be possible and knowable by means of the first,\nand their co-existence by means of the second? According to this, if all\neffect is reciprocal effect, succession and simultaneity would be the same\nthing, and therefore everything in the world would take place at the same\nmoment. If there were true reciprocity, then perpetual motion would also\nbe possible, and indeed _a priori_ certain; but it is rather the case that\nthe _a priori_ conviction that there is no true reciprocity, and no\ncorresponding form of the understanding, is the ground of the assertion\nthat perpetual motion is impossible.\n\nAristotle also denies reciprocity in the strict sense; for he remarks that\ntwo things may certainly be reciprocal causes of each other, but only if\nthis is understood in a different sense of each of them; for example, that\none acts upon the other as the motive, but the latter acts upon the former\nas the cause of its movement. We find in two passages the same words:\nPhysic., lib. ii. c. 3, and Metaph., lib. v. c. 2. Εστι δε τινα και\nαλληλων αιτια; οἱον το πονειν αιτιον της ευεξιας, και αὑτη του πονειν;\nαλλ᾽ ου τον αυτον τροπον, αλλα το μεν ὡς τελος, το δε ὡς αρχη κινησεως.\n(_Sunt præterea quæ sibi sunt mutuo causæ, ut exercitium bonæ habitudinis,\net hæc exercitii: at non eodem modo, sed hæc ut finis, aliud ut principium\nmotus._) If, besides this, he had accepted a reciprocity proper, he would\nhave introduced it here, for in both passages he is concerned with\nenumerating all the possible kinds of causes. In the _Analyt. post._, lib.\nii. c. 11, he speaks of a circle of causes and effects, but not of\nreciprocity.\n\n4. The categories of _Modality_ have this advantage over all others, that\nwhat is expressed through each of them really corresponds to the form of\njudgment from which it is derived; which with the other categories is\nscarcely ever the case, because for the most part they are deduced from\nthe forms of judgment with the most capricious violence.\n\nThus that it is the conceptions of the possible, the actual, and the\nnecessary which occasion the problematic, assertatory, and apodictic forms\nof judgment, is perfectly true; but that those conceptions are special,\noriginal forms of knowledge of the understanding which cannot be further\ndeduced is not true. On the contrary, they spring from the single original\nform of all knowledge, which is, therefore, known to us _a priori_, the\nprinciple of sufficient reason; and indeed out of this the knowledge of\n_necessity_ springs directly. On the other hand, it is only because\nreflection is applied to this that the conceptions of contingency,\npossibility, impossibility, and actuality arise. Therefore all these do\nnot by any means spring from _one_ faculty of the mind, the understanding,\nbut arise through the conflict of abstract and intuitive knowledge, as\nwill be seen directly.\n\nI hold that to be necessary and to be the consequent of a given reason are\nabsolutely interchangeable notions, and completely identical. We can never\nknow, nor even think, anything as necessary, except so far as we regard it\nas the consequent of a given reason; and the conception of necessity\ncontains absolutely nothing more than this dependence, this being\nestablished through something else, and this inevitable following from it.\nThus it arises and exists simply and solely through the application of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason. Therefore, there is, according to the\ndifferent forms of this principle, a physical necessity (the effect from\nthe cause), a logical (through the ground of knowing, in analytical\njudgments, syllogisms, &c.), a mathematical (according to the ground of\nbeing in time and space), and finally a practical necessity, by which we\nintend to signify not determination through a pretended categorical\nimperative, but the necessary occurrence of an action according to the\nmotives presented, in the case of a given empirical character. But\neverything necessary is only so relatively, that is, under the\npresupposition of the reason from which it follows; therefore absolute\nnecessity is a contradiction. With regard to the rest, I refer to § 49 of\nthe essay on the principle of sufficient reason.\n\nThe contradictory opposite, _i.e._, the denial of necessity, is\n_contingency_. The content of this conception is, therefore,\nnegative—nothing more than this: absence of the connection expressed by\nthe principle of sufficient reason. Consequently the contingent is also\nalways merely relative. It is contingent in relation to something which is\nnot its reason. Every object, of whatever kind it may be—for example,\nevery event in the actual world—is always at once necessary and\ncontingent, _necessary_ in relation to the _one_ condition which is its\ncause: _contingent_ in relation to everything else. For its contact in\ntime and space with everything else is a mere coincidence without\nnecessary connection: hence also the words chance, συμπτωμα, _contingens_.\nTherefore an absolute contingency is just as inconceivable as an absolute\nnecessity. For the former would be simply an object which stood to no\nother in the relation of consequent to its reason. But the\ninconceivability of such a thing is just the content of the principle of\nsufficient reason negatively expressed, and therefore this principle must\nfirst be upset before we can think an absolute contingency; and even then\nit itself would have lost all significance, for the conception of\ncontingency has meaning only in relation to that principle, and signifies\nthat two objects do not stand to each other in the relation of reason and\nconsequent.\n\nIn nature, which consists of ideas of perception, everything that happens\nis necessary; for it proceeds from its cause. If, however, we consider\nthis individual with reference to everything else which is not its cause,\nwe know it as contingent; but this is already an abstract reflection. Now,\nfurther, let us abstract entirely from a natural object its causal\nrelation to everything else, thus its necessity and its contingency; then\nthis kind of knowledge comprehends the conception of the _actual_, in\nwhich one only considers the _effect_, without looking for the cause, in\nrelation to which one would otherwise have to call it _necessary_, and in\nrelation to everything else _contingent_. All this rests ultimately upon\nthe fact that the _modality_ of the judgment does not indicate so much the\nobjective nature of things as the relation of our knowledge to them.\nSince, however, in nature everything proceeds from a cause, everything\n_actual_ is also _necessary_, yet only so far as it is _at this time, in\nthis place;_ for only so far does determination by the law of causality\nextend. Let us leave, however, concrete nature and pass over to abstract\nthinking; then we can present to ourselves in reflection all the natural\nlaws which are known to us partly _a priori_, partly only _a posteriori_,\nand this abstract idea contains all that is in nature at _any_ time, in\n_any_ place, but with abstraction from every definite time and place; and\njust in this way, through such reflection, we have entered the wide\nkingdom of _the possible_. But what finds no place even here is the\n_impossible_. It is clear that possibility and impossibility exist only\nfor reflection, for abstract knowledge of the reason, not for knowledge of\nperception; although it is the pure forms of perception which supply the\nreason with the determination of the possible and impossible. According as\nthe laws of nature, from which we start in the thought of the possible and\nimpossible, are known _a priori_ or _a posteriori_, is the possibility or\nimpossibility metaphysical or physical.\n\nFrom this exposition, which requires no proof because it rests directly\nupon the knowledge of the principle of sufficient reason and upon the\ndevelopment of the conceptions of the necessary, the actual, and the\npossible, it is sufficiently evident how entirely groundless is Kant’s\nassumption of three special functions of the understanding for these three\nconceptions, and that here again he has allowed himself to be disturbed by\nno reflection in the carrying out of his architectonic symmetry.\n\nTo this, however, we have to add the other great mistake, that, certainly\naccording to the procedure of earlier philosophy, he has confounded the\nconceptions of necessity and contingency with each other. That earlier\nphilosophy has applied abstraction to the following mistaken use. It was\nclear that that of which the reason is given inevitably follows, _i.e._,\ncannot not be, and thus necessarily is. But that philosophy held to this\nlast determination alone, and said that is necessary which cannot be\notherwise, or the opposite of which is impossible. It left, however, the\nground and root of such necessity out of account, overlooked the\nrelativity of all necessity which follows from it, and thereby made the\nquite unthinkable fiction of an _absolute necessity_, _i.e._, of something\nthe existence of which would be as inevitable as the consequent of a\nreason, but which yet was not the consequent of a reason, and therefore\ndepended upon nothing; an addition which is an absurd _petitio_, for it\nconflicts with the principle of sufficient reason. Now, starting from this\nfiction, it explained, in diametrical opposition to the truth, all that is\nestablished by a reason as contingent, because it looked at the relative\nnature of its necessity and compared this with that entirely imaginary\n_absolute_ necessity, which is self-contradictory in its conception.(5)\nNow Kant adheres to this fundamentally perverse definition of the\ncontingent and gives it as explanation. (Critique of Pure Reason, V. p.\n289-291, 243. V. 301, 419. V. 447, 486, 488.) He falls indeed into the\nmost evident contradiction with himself upon this point, for on p. 301 he\nsays: “Everything contingent has a cause,” and adds, “That is contingent\nwhich might possibly not be.” But whatever has a cause cannot possibly not\nbe: thus it is necessary. For the rest, the source of the whole of this\nfalse explanation of the necessary and the contingent is to be found in\nAristotle in “_De Generatione et Corruptione_,” lib. ii. c. 9 et 11, where\nthe necessary is explained as that which cannot possibly not be: there\nstands in opposition to it that which cannot possibly be, and between\nthese two lies that which can both be and not be,—thus that which comes\ninto being and passes away, and this would then be the contingent. In\naccordance with what has been said above, it is clear that this\nexplanation, like so many of Aristotle’s, has resulted from sticking to\nabstract conceptions without going back to the concrete and perceptible,\nin which, however, the source of all abstract conceptions lies, and by\nwhich therefore they must always be controlled. “Something which cannot\npossibly not be” can certainly be thought in the abstract, but if we go\nwith it to the concrete, the real, the perceptible, we find nothing to\nsupport the thought, even as possible,—as even merely the asserted\nconsequent of a given reason, whose necessity is yet relative and\nconditioned.\n\nI take this opportunity of adding a few further remarks on these\nconceptions of modality. Since all necessity rests upon the principle of\nsufficient reason, and is on this account relative, all _apodictic_\njudgments are originally, and according to their ultimate significance,\n_hypothetical_. They become _categorical_ only through the addition of an\n_assertatory_ minor, thus in the conclusion. If this minor is still\nundecided, and this indecision is expressed, this gives the problematical\njudgment.\n\nWhat in general (as a rule) is apodictic (a law of nature), is in\nreference to a particular case only problematical, because the condition\nmust actually appear which brings the case under the rule. And conversely,\nwhat in the particular as such is necessary (apodictic) (every particular\nchange necessary through the cause), is again in general, and predicated\nuniversally, only problematical; because the causes which appear only\nconcern the particular case, and the apodictic, always hypothetical\njudgment, always expresses merely the general law, not the particular case\ndirectly. All this has its ground in the fact that possibility exists only\nin the province of reflection and for the reason; the actual, in the\nprovince of perception and for the understanding; the necessary, for both.\nIndeed, the distinction between necessary, actual, and possible really\nexists only in the abstract and according to the conception; in the real\nworld, on the other hand, all three fall into one. For all that happens,\nhappens _necessarily_, because it happens from causes; but these\nthemselves have again causes, so that the whole of the events of the\nworld, great and small, are a strict concatenation of necessary\noccurrences. Accordingly everything actual is also necessary, and in the\nreal world there is no difference between actuality and necessity, and in\nthe same way no difference between actuality and possibility; for what has\nnot happened, _i.e._, has not become actual, was also not possible,\nbecause the causes without which it could never appear have not themselves\nappeared, nor could appear, in the great concatenation of causes; thus it\nwas an impossibility. Every event is therefore either necessary or\nimpossible. All this holds good only of the empirically real world,\n_i.e._, the complex of individual things, thus of the whole particular as\nsuch. If, on the other hand, we consider things generally, comprehending\nthem _in abstracto_, necessity, actuality, and possibility are again\nseparated; we then know everything which is in accordance with the _a\npriori_ laws which belong to our intellect as possible in general; that\nwhich corresponds to the empirical laws of nature as possible in this\nworld, even if it has never become actual; thus we distinguish clearly the\npossible from the actual. The actual is in itself always also necessary,\nbut is only comprehended as such by him who knows its cause; regarded\napart from this, it is and is called contingent. This consideration also\ngives us the key to that _contentio_ περι δυνατων between the Megaric\nDiodorus and Chrysippus the Stoic which Cicero refers to in his book _De\nFato_. Diodorus says: “Only what becomes actual was possible, and all that\nis actual is also necessary.” Chrysippus on the other hand says: “Much\nthat is possible never becomes actual; for only the necessary becomes\nactual.” We may explain this thus: Actuality is the conclusion of a\nsyllogism to which possibility gives the premises. But for this is\nrequired not only the major but also the minor; only the two give complete\npossibility. The major gives a merely theoretical, general possibility _in\nabstracto_, but this of itself does not make anything possible, _i.e._,\ncapable of becoming actual. For this the minor also is needed, which gives\nthe possibility for the particular case, because it brings it under the\nrule, and thereby it becomes at once actual. For example:\n\n_Maj._ All houses (consequently also my house) can be destroyed by fire.\n\n_Min._ My house is on fire.\n\n_Concl._ My house is being destroyed by fire.\n\nFor every general proposition, thus every major, always determines things\nwith reference to actuality only under a presupposition, therefore\nhypothetically; for example, the capability of being burnt down has as a\npresupposition the catching fire. This presupposition is produced in the\nminor. The major always loads the cannon, but only if the minor brings the\nmatch does the shot, _i.e._, the conclusion, follow. This holds good\nthroughout of the relation of possibility to actuality. Since now the\nconclusion, which is the assertion of actuality, always follows\n_necessarily_, it is evident from this that all that is actual is also\nnecessary, which can also be seen from the fact that necessity only means\nbeing the consequent of a given reason: this is in the case of the actual\na cause: thus everything actual is necessary. Accordingly, we see here the\nconceptions of the possible, the actual, and the necessary unite, and not\nmerely the last presuppose the first, but also the converse. What keeps\nthem apart is the limitation of our intellect through the form of time;\nfor time is the mediator between possibility and actuality. The necessity\nof the particular event may be fully seen from the knowledge of all its\ncauses; but the concurrence of the whole of these different and\nindependent causes seems to us _contingent_; indeed their independence of\neach other is just the conception of contingency. Since, however, each of\nthem was the necessary effect of _its_ causes, the chain of which has no\nbeginning, it is evident that contingency is merely a subjective\nphenomenon, arising from the limitation of the horizon of our\nunderstanding, and just as subjective as the optical horizon at which the\nheavens touch the earth.\n\nSince necessity is the same thing as following from given grounds, it must\nappear in a special way in the case of every form of the principle of\nsufficient reason, and also have its opposite in the possibility and\nimpossibility which always arises only through the application of the\nabstract reflection of the reason to the object. Therefore the four kinds\nof necessity mentioned above stand opposed to as many kinds of\nimpossibility, physical, logical, mathematical and practical. It may\nfurther be remarked that if one remains entirely within the province of\nabstract concepts, possibility is always connected with the more general,\nand necessity with the more limited concept; for example, “An animal _may_\nbe a bird, a fish, an amphibious creature, &c.” “A nightingale _must_ be a\nbird, a bird _must_ be an animal, an animal _must_ be an organism, an\norganism _must_ be a body.” This is because logical necessity, the\nexpression of which is the syllogism, proceeds from the general to the\nparticular, and never conversely. In the concrete world of nature (ideas\nof the first class), on the contrary, everything is really necessary\nthrough the law of causality; only added reflection can conceive it as\nalso contingent, comparing it with that which is not its cause, and also\nas merely and purely actual, by disregarding all causal connection. Only\nin this class of ideas does the conception of the _actual_ properly occur,\nas is also shown by the derivation of the word from the conception of\ncausality. In the third class of ideas, that of pure mathematical\nperception or intuition, if we confine ourselves strictly to it, there is\nonly necessity. Possibility occurs here also only through relation to the\nconcepts of reflection: for example, “A triangle _may_ be right-angled,\nobtuse-angled, or equiangular; its three angles _must_ be equal to two\nright-angles.” Thus here we only arrive at the possible through the\ntransition from the perceptible to the abstract.\n\nAfter this exposition, which presupposes the recollection of what was said\nboth in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason and in the first\nbook of the present work, there will, it is hoped, be no further doubt as\nto the true and very heterogeneous source of those forms which the table\nof judgments lays before us, nor as to the inadmissibility and utter\ngroundlessness of the assumption of twelve special functions of the\nunderstanding for the explanation of them. The latter point is also\nsupported by a number of special circumstances very easily noted. Thus,\nfor example, it requires great love of symmetry and much trust in a clue\nderived from it, to lead one to assume that an affirmative, a categorical,\nand an assertatory judgment are three such different things that they\njustify the assumption of an entirely special function of the\nunderstanding for each of them.\n\nKant himself betrays his consciousness of the untenable nature of his\ndoctrine of the categories by the fact that in the third chapter of the\nAnalytic of Principles (_phænomena et noumena_) several long passages of\nthe first edition (p. 241, 242, 244-246, 248-253) are omitted in the\nsecond—passages which displayed the weakness of that doctrine too openly.\nSo, for example, he says there (p. 241) that he has not defined the\nindividual categories, because he could not define them even if he had\nwished to do so, inasmuch as they were susceptible of no definition. In\nsaying this he forgot that at p. 82 of the same first edition he had said:\n“I purposely dispense with the definition of the categories although I may\nbe in possession of it.” This then was, _sit venia verbo_, wind. But this\nlast passage he has allowed to stand. And so all those passages wisely\nomitted afterwards betray the fact that nothing distinct can be thought in\nconnection with the categories, and this whole doctrine stands upon a weak\nfoundation.\n\nThis table of the categories is now made the guiding clue according to\nwhich every metaphysical, and indeed every scientific inquiry is to be\nconducted (Prolegomena, § 39). And, in fact, it is not only the foundation\nof the whole Kantian philosophy and the type according to which its\nsymmetry is everywhere carried out, as I have already shown above, but it\nhas also really become the procrustean bed into which Kant forces every\npossible inquiry, by means of a violence which I shall now consider\nsomewhat more closely. But with such an opportunity what must not the\n_imitatores servum pecus_ have done! We have seen. That violence then is\napplied in this way. The meaning of the expressions denoted by the titles,\nforms of judgment and categories, is entirely set aside and forgotten, and\nthe expressions alone are retained. These have their source partly in\nAristotle’s _Analyt. priora_, i. 23 (περι ποιοτητος και ποσοτητος των του\nσυλλογισμου ὁρων: _de qualitate et quantitate terminorum syllogismi_), but\nare arbitrarily chosen; for the extent of the concepts might certainly\nhave been otherwise expressed than through the word _quantity_, though\nthis word is more suited to its object than the rest of the titles of the\ncategories. Even the word _quality_ has obviously been chosen on account\nof the custom of opposing quality to quantity; for the name quality is\ncertainly taken arbitrarily enough for affirmation and negation. But now\nin every inquiry instituted by Kant, every quantity in time and space, and\nevery possible quality of things, physical, moral, &c., is brought by him\nunder those category titles, although between these things and those\ntitles of the forms of judgment and of thought there is absolutely nothing\nin common except the accidental and arbitrary nomenclature. It is needful\nto keep in mind all the respect which in other regards is due to Kant to\nenable one to refrain from expressing in hard terms one’s repugnance to\nthis procedure. The nearest example is afforded us at once by the pure\nphysiological table of the general principles of natural science. What in\nall the world has the quantity of judgments to do with the fact that every\nperception has an extensive magnitude? What has the quality of judgments\nto do with the fact that every sensation has a degree? The former rests\nrather on the fact that space is the form of our external perception, and\nthe latter is nothing more than an empirical, and, moreover, entirely\nsubjective feeling, drawn merely from the consideration of the nature of\nour organs of sense. Further, in the table which gives the basis of\nrational psychology (Critique of Pure Reason, p. 344; V. 402), the\n_simplicity_ of the soul is cited under quality; but this is just a\nquantitative property, and has absolutely no relation to the affirmation\nor negation in the judgment. But quantity had to be completed by the\n_unity_ of the soul, which is, however, already included in its\nsimplicity. Then modality is forced in in an absurd way; the soul stands\nin connection with _possible_ objects; but connection belongs to relation,\nonly this is already taken possession of by substance. Then the four\ncosmological Ideas, which are the material of the antinomies, are referred\nto the titles of the categories; but of this we shall speak more fully\nfurther on, when we come to the examination of these antinomies. Several,\nif possible, still more glaring examples are to be found in the table of\nthe _Categories of Freedom!_ in the “Critique of Practical Reason;” also\nin the first book of the “Critique of Judgment,” which goes through the\njudgment of taste according to the four titles of the categories; and,\nfinally, in the “Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science,” which\nare entirely adapted to the table of the categories, whereby the false\nthat is mingled here and there with what is true and excellent in this\nimportant work is for the most part introduced. See, for example, at the\nend of the first chapter how the unity, the multiplicity, and the totality\nof the directions of lines are supposed to correspond to the categories,\nwhich are so named according to the quantity of judgments.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nThe principle of the _Permanence of Substance_ is deduced from the\ncategory of subsistence and inherence. This, however, we know only from\nthe form of the categorical judgment, _i.e._, from the connection of two\nconcepts as subject and predicate. With what violence then is that great\nmetaphysical principle made dependent upon this simple, purely logical\nform! Yet this is only done _pro forma_, and for the sake of symmetry. The\nproof of this principle, which is given here, sets entirely aside its\nsupposed origin in the understanding and in the category, and is based\nupon the pure intuition or perception of time. But this proof also is\nquite incorrect. It is false that in mere time there is _simultaneity_ and\n_duration_; these ideas only arise from the union of _space_ with time, as\nI have already shown in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, §\n18, and worked out more fully in § 4 of the present work. I must assume a\nknowledge of both these expositions for the understanding of what follows.\nIt is false that time _remains_ the same through all change; on the\ncontrary, it is just time itself that is fleeting; a permanent time is a\ncontradiction. Kant’s proof is untenable, strenuously as he has supported\nit with sophisms; indeed, he falls into the most palpable contradictions.\nThus, after he has falsely set up co-existence as a mode of time (p. 177;\nV. 219), he says, quite rightly (p. 183; V. 226), “Co-existence is not a\nmode of time, for in time there are absolutely no parts together, but all\nin succession.” In truth, space is quite as much implicated in\nco-existence as time. For if two things are co-existent and yet not one,\nthey are different in respect of space; if two states of one thing are\nco-existent (_e.g._, the glow and the heat of iron), then they are two\ncontemporaneous effects of _one_ thing, therefore presuppose matter, and\nmatter presupposes space. Strictly speaking, co-existence is a negative\ndetermination, which merely signifies that two things or states are not\ndifferent in respect of time; thus their difference is to be sought for\nelsewhere. But in any case, our knowledge of the permanence of substance,\n_i.e._, of matter, must be based upon insight _a priori_; for it is raised\nabove all doubt, and therefore cannot be drawn from experience. I deduce\nit from the fact that the principle of all becoming and passing away, the\nlaw of causality, of which we are conscious _a priori_, is essentially\nconcerned only with the _changes_, _i.e._, the successive _states_ of\nmatter, is thus limited to the form, and leaves the matter untouched,\nwhich therefore exists in our consciousness as the foundation of all\nthings, which is not subject to becoming or passing away, which has\ntherefore always been and will always continue to be. A deeper proof of\nthe permanence of substance, drawn from the analysis of our perception of\nthe empirical world in general, is to be found in the first book of this\nwork, § 4, where it is shown that the nature of matter consists in the\nabsolute _union of space and time_, a union which is only possible by\nmeans of the idea of causality, consequently only for the understanding,\nwhich is nothing but the subjective correlative of causality. Hence, also,\nmatter is never known otherwise than as producing effects, _i.e._, as\nthrough and through causality; to be and to act are with it one, which is\nindeed signified by the word _actuality_. Intimate union of space and\ntime—causality, matter, actuality—are thus one, and the subjective\ncorrelative of this one is the understanding. Matter must bear in itself\nthe conflicting properties of both factors from which it proceeds, and it\nis the idea of causality which abolishes what is contradictory in both,\nand makes their co-existence conceivable by the understanding, through\nwhich and for which alone matter is, and whose whole faculty consists in\nthe knowledge of cause and effect. Thus for the understanding there is\nunited in matter the inconstant flux of time, appearing as change of the\naccidents, with the rigid immobility of space, which exhibits itself as\nthe permanence of substance. For if the substance passed away like the\naccidents, the phenomenon would be torn away from space altogether, and\nwould only belong to time; the world of experience would be destroyed by\nthe abolition of matter, annihilation. Thus from the share which space has\nin matter, _i.e._, in all phenomena of the actual—in that it is the\nopposite and counterpart of time, and therefore in itself and apart from\nthe union with the latter knows absolutely no change—the principle of the\npermanence of substance, which recognises everything as _a priori_\ncertain, had to be deduced and explained; but not from mere time, to which\nfor this purpose and quite erroneously Kant has attributed _permanence_.\n\nIn the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 23, I have fully\nexplained the incorrectness of the following proof of the _a priori_\nnature and of the necessity of the law of causality from the mere\nsuccession of events in time; I must, therefore, content myself here by\nreferring to that passage.(6) This is precisely the case with the proof of\nreciprocity also, the concept of which I was obliged to explain above as\ninvalid. What is necessary has also been said of modality, the working out\nof the principles of which now follows.\n\nThere are still a few points in the further course of the transcendental\nanalytic which I should have to refute were it not that I am afraid of\ntrying the patience of the reader; I therefore leave them to his own\nreflection. But ever anew in the “Critique of Pure Reason” we meet that\nprincipal and fundamental error of Kant’s, which I have copiously\ndenounced above, the complete failure to distinguish abstract, discursive\nknowledge from intuitive. It is this that throws a constant obscurity over\nKant’s whole theory of the faculty of knowledge, and never allows the\nreader to know what he is really speaking about at any time, so that\ninstead of understanding, he always merely conjectures, for he alternately\ntries to understand what is said as referring to thought and to\nperception, and remains always in suspense. In the chapter “On the\nDivision of all Objects into Phenomena and Noumena,” Kant carries that\nincredible want of reflection as to the nature of the idea of perception\nand the abstract idea, as I shall explain more fully immediately, so far\nas to make the monstrous assertion that without thought, that is, without\nabstract conceptions, there is no knowledge of an object; and that\nperception, because it is not thought, is also not knowledge, and, in\ngeneral, is nothing but a mere affection of sensibility, mere sensation!\nNay, more, that perception without conception is absolutely void; but\nconception without perception is yet always something (p. 253; V. 309).\nNow this is exactly the opposite of the truth; for concepts obtain all\nsignificance, all content, only from their relation to ideas of\nperception, from which they have been abstracted, derived, that is,\nconstructed through the omission of all that is unessential: therefore if\nthe foundation of perception is taken away from them, they are empty and\nvoid. Perceptions, on the contrary, have in themselves immediate and very\ngreat significance (in them, indeed, the thing in itself objectifies\nitself); they represent themselves, express themselves, have no mere\nborrowed content like concepts. For the principle of sufficient reason\ngoverns them only as the law of causality, and determines as such only\ntheir position in space and time; it does not, however, condition their\ncontent and their significance, as is the case with concepts, in which it\nappears as the principle of the ground of knowing. For the rest, it looks\nas if Kant really wished here to set about distinguishing the idea of\nperception and the abstract idea. He objects to Leibnitz and Locke that\nthe former reduced everything to abstract ideas, and the latter everything\nto ideas of perception. But yet he arrives at no distinction; and although\nLocke and Leibnitz really committed these errors, Kant himself is burdened\nwith a third error which includes them both—the error of having so mixed\nup knowledge of perception and abstract knowledge that a monstrous hybrid\nof the two resulted, a chimera of which no distinct idea is possible, and\nwhich therefore necessarily only confused and stupefied students, and set\nthem at variance.\n\nCertainly thought and perception are separated more in the chapter\nreferred to “On the Division of all Objects into Phenomena and Noumena”\nthan anywhere else, but the nature of this distinction is here a\nfundamentally false one. On p. 253; V. 309, it is said: “If I take away\nall thought (through the categories) from empirical knowledge, there\nremains absolutely no knowledge of an object, for through mere perception\nnothing at all is thought, and that this affection of sensibility is in me\nestablishes really no relation of such ideas to any object.” This sentence\ncontains, in some degree, all the errors of Kant in a nutshell; for it\nbrings out clearly that he has falsely conceived the relation between\nsensation, perception, and thought, and accordingly identifies the\nperception, whose form he yet supposes to be space, and indeed space in\nall its three dimensions, with the mere subjective sensation in the organs\nof sense, but only allows the knowledge of an object to be given through\nthought, which is different from perception. I, on the contrary, say:\nObjects are first of all objects of perception, not of thought, and all\nknowledge of _objects_ is originally and in itself perception. Perception,\nhowever, is by no means mere sensation, but the understanding is already\nactive in it. The thought, which is added only in the case of men, not in\nthe case of the brutes, is mere abstraction from perception, gives no\nfundamentally new knowledge, does not itself establish objects which were\nnot before, but merely changes the form of the knowledge already won\nthrough perception, makes it abstract knowledge in concepts, whereby its\nconcrete or perceptible character is lost, but, on the other hand,\ncombination of it becomes possible, which immeasurably extends the range\nof its applicability. The material of our thought is, on the other hand,\nnothing else than our perceptions themselves, and not something which the\nperceptions did not contain, and which was added by the thought; therefore\nthe material of everything that appears in our thought must be capable of\nverification in our perception, for otherwise it would be an empty\nthought. Although this material is variously manipulated and transformed\nby thought, it must yet be capable of being reduced to perception, and the\nthought traced back to this—just as a piece of gold can be reduced from\nall its solutions, oxides, sublimates, and combinations, and presented\npure and undiminished. This could not happen if thought itself had added\nsomething, and, indeed, the principal thing, to the object.\n\nThe whole of the chapter on the Amphiboly, which follows this, is merely a\ncriticism of the Leibnitzian philosophy, and as such is on the whole\ncorrect, though the form or pattern on which it is constructed is chosen\nmerely for the sake of architectonic symmetry, which here also is the\nguiding clue. Thus, to carry out the analogy with the Aristotelian\nOrganon, a transcendental Topic is set up, which consists in this, that\nevery conception is to be considered from four points of view, in order to\nmake out to which faculty of knowledge it belongs. But these four points\nof view are quite arbitrarily selected, and ten others might be added to\nthem with just as much right; but their fourfold number corresponds to the\ntitles of the categories, and therefore the chief doctrine of Leibnitz is\ndivided among them as best it may be. By this critique, also, to some\nextent, certain errors are stamped as natural to the reason, whereas they\nwere merely false abstractions of Leibnitz’s, who, rather than learn from\nhis great philosophical contemporaries, Spinoza and Locke, preferred to\nserve up his own strange inventions. In the chapter on the Amphiboly of\nReflection it is finally said that there may possibly be a kind of\nperception entirely different from ours, to which, however, our categories\nare applicable; therefore the objects of that supposed perception would be\n_noumena_, things which can only be _thought_ by us; but since the\nperception which would give that thought meaning is wanting to us, and\nindeed is altogether quite problematical, the object of that thought would\nalso merely be a wholly indefinite possibility. I have shown above by\nquotations that Kant, in utter contradiction with himself, sets up the\ncategories now as the condition of knowledge of perception, now as the\nfunction of merely abstract thought. Here they appear exclusively in the\nlatter sense, and it seems quite as if he wished to attribute them merely\nto discursive thought. But if this is really his opinion, then necessarily\nat the beginning of the Transcendental Logic, before specifying the\ndifferent functions of thought at such length, he was necessarily bound to\ncharacterise thought in general, and consequently to distinguish it from\nperception; he ought to have shown what knowledge is given by mere\nperception, and what that is new is added by thought. Then we would have\nknown what he was really speaking about; or rather, he would then have\nspoken quite differently, first of perception, and then of thought;\ninstead of which, as it is, he is always dealing with something between\nthe two, which is a mere delusion. There would not then be that great gap\nbetween the transcendental Æsthetic and the transcendental Logic, where,\nafter the exposition of the mere form of perception, he simply dismisses\nits content, all that is empirically apprehended, with the phrase “It is\ngiven,” and does not ask how it came about, _whether with or without\nunderstanding_; but, with one spring, passes over to abstract thought; and\nnot even to thought in general, but at once to certain forms of thought,\nand does not say a word about what thought is, what the concept is, what\nis the relation of abstract and discursive to concrete and intuitive, what\nis the difference between the knowledge of men and that of brutes, and\nwhat is reason.\n\nYet it was just this distinction between abstract knowledge and knowledge\nof perception, entirely overlooked by Kant, which the ancients denoted by\nφαινομενα and νοουμενα,(7) and whose opposition and incommensurability\noccupied them so much in the philosophemes of the Eleatics, in Plato’s\ndoctrine of Ideas, in the dialectic of the Megarics, and later the\nScholastics in the controversy between Nominalism and Realism, the seed of\nwhich, so late in developing, was already contained in the opposite mental\ntendencies of Plato and Aristotle. But Kant, who, in an inexcusable\nmanner, entirely neglected the thing to denote which the words φαινομενα\nand νοουμενα had already been taken, took possession of the words, as if\nthey were still unappropriated, in order to denote by them his thing in\nitself and his phenomenon.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nSince I have been obliged to reject Kant’s doctrine of the categories,\njust as he rejected that of Aristotle, I wish here to indicate as a\nsuggestion a third way of reaching what is aimed at. What both Kant and\nAristotle sought for under the name of the categories were the most\ngeneral conceptions under which all things, however different, must be\nsubsumed, and through which therefore everything that exists would\nultimately be thought. Just on this account Kant conceived them as the\n_forms_ of all thought.\n\nGrammar is related to logic as clothes to the body. Should not, therefore,\nthese primary conceptions, the ground-bass of the reason, which is the\nfoundation of all special thought, without whose application, therefore,\nno thought can take place, ultimately lie in those conceptions which just\non account of their exceeding generality (transcendentalism) have their\nexpression not in single words, but in whole classes of words, because one\nof them is thought along with every word whatever it may be, whose\ndesignation would therefore have to be looked for, not in the lexicon but\nin the grammar? In fact, should they not be those distinctions of\nconceptions on account of which the word which expresses them is either a\nsubstantive or an adjective, a verb or an adverb, a pronoun, a\npreposition, or some other particle—in short, the parts of speech? For\nundoubtedly these denote the forms which all thought primarily assumes,\nand in which it directly moves; accordingly they are the essential forms\nof speech, the fundamental constituent elements of every language, so that\nwe cannot imagine any language which would not consist of at least\nsubstantives, adjectives, and verbs. These fundamental forms would then\nhave subordinated to them those forms of thought which are expressed\nthrough their inflections, that is, through declension and conjugation,\nand it is unessential to the chief concern whether in denoting them we\ncall in the assistance of the article and the pronoun. We will examine the\nthing, however, somewhat more closely, and ask the question anew: What are\nthe forms of thought?\n\n(1.) Thought consists throughout of judging; judgments are the threads of\nits whole web, for without making use of a verb our thought does not move,\nand as often as we use a verb we judge.\n\n(2.) Every judgment consists in the recognition of the relation between\nsubject and predicate, which it separates or unites with various\nrestrictions. It unites them from the recognition of the actual identity\nof the two, which can only happen in the case of synonyms; then in the\nrecognition that the one is always thought along with the other, though\nthe converse does not hold—in the universal affirmative proposition; up to\nthe recognition that the one is sometimes thought along with the other, in\nthe particular affirmative proposition. The negative propositions take the\nopposite course. Accordingly in every judgment the subject, the predicate,\nand the copula, the latter affirmative or negative, must be to be found;\neven although each of these is not denoted by a word of its own, as is\nhowever generally the case. The predicate and the copula are often denoted\nby _one_ word, as “Caius ages;” sometimes one word denotes all three, as\n_concurritur_, _i.e._, “the armies engage.” From this it is evident that\nthe forms of thought are not to be sought for precisely and directly in\nwords, nor even in the parts of speech, for even in the same language the\nsame judgment may be expressed in different words, and indeed in different\nparts of speech, yet the thought remains the same, and consequently also\nits form; for the thought could not be the same if the form of thought\nitself were different. But with the same thought and the same form of\nthought the form of words may very well be different, for it is merely the\noutward clothing of the thought, which, on the other hand, is inseparable\nfrom _its_ form. Thus grammar only explains the clothing of the forms of\nthought. The parts of speech can therefore be deduced from the original\nforms of thought themselves which are independent of all language; their\nwork is to express these forms of thought in all their modifications. They\nare the instrument and the clothing of the forms of thought, and must be\naccurately adapted to the structure of the latter, so that it may be\nrecognised in them.\n\n(3.) These real, unalterable, original forms of thought are certainly\n_those of Kant’s logical table of judgments_; only that in this table are\nto be found blind windows for the sake of symmetry and the table of the\ncategories; these must all be omitted, and also a false arrangement.\nThus:—\n\n(_a._) _Quality_: affirmation and negation, _i.e._, combination and\nseparation of concepts: two forms. It depends on the copula.\n\n(_b._) _Quantity_: the subject-concept is taken either in whole or in\npart: totality or multiplicity. To the first belong also individual\nsubjects: Socrates means “all Socrateses.” Thus two forms. It depends on\nthe subject.\n\n(_c._) _Modality_: has really three forms. It determines the quality as\nnecessary, actual, or contingent. It consequently depends also on the\ncopula.\n\nThese three forms of thought spring from the laws of thought of\ncontradiction and identity. But from the principle of sufficient reason\nand the law of excluded middle springs—\n\n(_d._) _Relation._ It only appears if we judge concerning completed\njudgments, and can only consist in this, that it either asserts the\ndependence of one judgment upon another (also in the plurality of both),\nand therefore combines them in the _hypothetical_ proposition; or else\nasserts that judgments exclude each other, and therefore separates them in\nthe _disjunctive_ proposition. It depends on the copula, which here\nseparates or combines the completed judgments.\n\nThe _parts of speech_ and grammatical forms are ways of expressing the\nthree constituent parts of the judgment, the subject, the predicate, and\nthe copula, and also of the possible relations of these; thus of the forms\nof thought just enumerated, and the fuller determinations and\nmodifications of these. Substantive, adjective, and verb are therefore\nessential fundamental constituent elements of language in general;\ntherefore they must be found in all languages. Yet it is possible to\nconceive a language in which adjective and verb would always be fused\ntogether, as is sometimes the case in all languages. Provisionally it may\nbe said, for the expression of the _subject_ are intended the substantive,\nthe article, and the pronoun; for the expression of the _predicate_, the\nadjective, the adverb, and the preposition; for the expression of the\n_copula_, the verb, which, however, with the exception of the verb to be,\nalso contains the predicate. It is the task of the philosophy of grammar\nto teach the precise mechanism of the expression of the forms of thought,\nas it is the task of logic to teach the operations with the forms of\nthought themselves.\n\n_Note._—As a warning against a false path and to illustrate the above, I\nmention S. Stern’s “_Vorläufige Grundlage zur Sprachphilosophie_,” 1835,\nwhich is an utterly abortive attempt to construct the categories out of\nthe grammatical forms. He has entirely confused thought with perception,\nand therefore, instead of the categories of thought, he has tried to\ndeduce the supposed categories of perception from the grammatical forms,\nand consequently has placed the grammatical forms in direct relation to\nperception. He is involved in the great error that _language_ is\nimmediately related to _perception_, instead of being directly related\nonly to thought as such, thus to the _abstract concepts_, and only by\nmeans of these to perception, to which they, however, have a relation\nwhich introduces an entire change of the form. What exists in perception,\nthus also the relations which proceed from time and space, certainly\nbecomes an object of thought; thus there must also be forms of speech to\nexpress it, yet always merely in the abstract, as concepts. Concepts are\nalways the primary material of thought, and the forms of logic are always\nrelated to these, never _directly_ to perception. Perception always\ndetermines only the material, never the formal truth of the proposition,\nfor the formal truth is determined according to the logical rules alone.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nI return to the Kantian philosophy, and come now to the _Transcendental\nDialectic_. Kant opens it with the explanation of _reason_, the faculty\nwhich is to play the principal part in it, for hitherto only sensibility\nand understanding were on the scene. When considering his different\nexplanations of reason, I have already spoken above of the explanation he\ngives here that “it is the faculty of principles.” It is now taught here\nthat all the _a priori_ knowledge hitherto considered, which makes pure\nmathematics and pure natural science possible, affords only _rules_, and\nno _principles_; because it proceeds from perceptions and forms of\nknowledge, and not from mere conceptions, which is demanded if it is to be\ncalled a principle. Such a principle must accordingly be knowledge _from\npure conceptions_ and yet _synthetical_. But this is absolutely\nimpossible. From pure conceptions nothing but _analytical_ propositions\ncan ever proceed. If conceptions are to be synthetically and yet _a\npriori_ combined, this combination must necessarily be accomplished by\nsome third thing, through a pure perception of the formal possibility of\nexperience, just as synthetic judgments _a posteriori_ are brought about\nthrough empirical perception; consequently a synthetic proposition _a\npriori_ can never proceed from pure conceptions. In general, however, we\nare _a priori_ conscious of nothing more than the principle of sufficient\nreason in its different forms, and therefore no other synthetic judgments\n_a priori_ are possible than those which proceed from that which receives\nits content from that principle.\n\nHowever, Kant finally comes forward with a pretended principle of the\nreason answering to his demand, yet only with this _one_, from which\nothers afterwards follow as corollaries. It is the principle which Chr.\nWolf set up and explained in his “_Cosmologia_,” sect. i. c. 2, § 93, and\nin his “_Ontologia_,”",

    "page_content": "Amphiboly, mere Leibnitzian philosophemes were taken for natural and\nnecessary aberrations of the reason, and were criticised as such, so here\nprecisely the same thing happens with the philosophemes of Wolf. Kant\nstill presents this principle of the reason in an obscure light, through\nindistinctness, indefiniteness, and breaking of it up (p. 307; V. 361, and\n322; V. 379). Clearly expressed, however, it is as follows: “If the\nconditioned is given, the totality of its conditions must also be given,\nand therefore also the _unconditioned_, through which alone that totality\nbecomes complete.” We become most vividly aware of the apparent truth of\nthis proposition if we imagine the conditions and the conditioned as the\nlinks of a suspended chain, the upper end of which, however, is not\nvisible, so that it might extend _ad infinitum_; since, however, the chain\ndoes not fall, but hangs, there must be above _one_ link which is the\nfirst, and in some way is fixed. Or, more briefly: the reason desires to\nhave a point of attachment for the causal chain which reaches back to\ninfinity; it would be convenient for it. But we will examine the\nproposition, not in figures, but in itself. Synthetic it certainly is;\nfor, analytically, nothing more follows from the conception of the\nconditioned than that of the condition. It has not, however, _a priori_\ntruth, nor even _a posteriori_, but it surreptitiously obtains its\nappearance of truth in a very subtle way, which I must now point out.\nImmediately, and _a priori_, we have the knowledge which the principle of\nsufficient reason in its four forms expresses. From this immediate\nknowledge all abstract expressions of the principle of sufficient reason\nare derived, and they are thus indirect; still more, however, is this the\ncase with inferences or corollaries from them. I have already explained\nabove how _abstract_ knowledge often unites a variety of _intuitive_\ncognitions in _one_ form or _one_ concept in such a way that they can no\nlonger be distinguished; therefore abstract knowledge stands to intuitive\nknowledge as the shadow to the real objects, the great multiplicity of\nwhich it presents through one outline comprehending them all. Now the\npretended principle of the reason makes use of this shadow. In order to\ndeduce from the principle of sufficient reason the unconditioned, which\ndirectly contradicts it, it prudently abandons the immediate concrete\nknowledge of the content of the principle of sufficient reason in its\nparticular forms, and only makes use of abstract concepts which are\nderived from it, and have value and significance only through it, in order\nto smuggle its unconditioned somehow or other into the wide sphere of\nthose concepts. Its procedure becomes most distinct when clothed in\ndialectical form; for example, thus: “If the conditioned exists, its\ncondition must also be given, and indeed all given, thus completely, thus\nthe totality of its conditions; consequently, if they constitute a series,\nthe whole series, consequently also its first beginning, thus the\nunconditioned.” Here it is false that the conditions of a conditioned can\nconstitute a _series_. Rather must the totality of the conditions of\neverything conditioned be contained in its _nearest_ ground or reason from\nwhich it directly proceeds, and which is only thus a _sufficient_ ground\nor reason. For example, the different determinations of the state which is\nthe cause, all of which must be present together before the effect can\ntake place. But the series, for example, the chain of causes, arises\nmerely from the fact that we regard what immediately before was the\ncondition as now a conditioned; but then at once the whole operation\nbegins again from the beginning, and the principle of sufficient reason\nappears anew with its claim. But there can never be for a conditioned a\nproperly successive _series_ of conditions, which exist merely as such,\nand on account of that which is at last conditioned; it is always an\nalternating series of conditioneds and conditions; as each link is laid\naside the chain is broken, and the claim of the principle of sufficient\nreason entirely satisfied, it arises anew because the condition becomes\nthe conditioned. Thus the principle of _sufficient_ reason always demands\nonly the completeness of the _immediate or next condition_, never the\ncompleteness of a _series_. But just this conception of the completeness\nof the condition leaves it undetermined whether this completeness should\nbe simultaneous or successive; and since the latter is chosen, the demand\nnow arises for a complete series of conditions following each other. Only\nthrough an arbitrary abstraction is a series of causes and effects\nregarded as a series of causes alone, which exists merely on account of\nthe last effect, and is therefore demanded as its _sufficient_ reason.\nFrom closer and more intelligent consideration, and by rising from the\nindefinite generality of abstraction to the particular definite reality,\nit appears, on the contrary, that the demand for a _sufficient_ reason\nextends only to the completeness of the determinations of the _immediate_\ncause, not to the completeness of a series. The demand of the principle of\nsufficient reason is completely extinguished in each sufficient reason\ngiven. It arises, however, immediately anew, because this reason is again\nregarded as a consequent; but it never demands directly a series of\nreasons. If, on the other hand, instead of going to the thing itself, we\nconfine ourselves to the abstract concepts, these distinctions vanish.\nThen a chain of alternating causes and effects, or of alternating logical\nreasons and consequents, is given out as simply a chain of causes of the\nlast effect, or reasons of the last consequent, and the _completeness of\nthe conditions_, through which alone a reason becomes _sufficient_,\nappears as the completeness of that assumed _series_ of reasons alone,\nwhich only exist on account of the last consequent. There then appears the\nabstract principle of the reason very boldly with its demand for the\nunconditioned. But, in order to recognise the invalidity of this claim,\nthere is no need of a critique of reason by means of antinomies and their\nsolution, but only of a critique of reason understood in my sense, an\nexamination of the relation of abstract knowledge to direct intuitive\nknowledge, by means of ascending from the indefinite generality of the\nformer to the fixed definiteness of the latter. From such a critique,\nthen, it here appears that the nature of the reason by no means consists\nin the demand for an unconditioned; for, whenever it proceeds with full\ndeliberation, it must itself find that an unconditioned is an absurdity.\nThe reason as a faculty of knowledge can always have to do only with\nobjects; but every object for the subject is necessarily and irrevocably\nsubordinated to the principle of sufficient reason, both _a parte ante_\nand _a parte post_. The validity of the principle of sufficient reason is\nso involved in the form of consciousness that we absolutely cannot imagine\nanything objective of which no _why_ could further be demanded; thus we\ncannot imagine an absolute absolute, like a blind wall in front of us.\nThat his convenience should lead this or that person to stop at some\npoint, and assume such an absolute at pleasure, is of no avail against\nthat incontestable certainty _a priori_, even if he should put on an air\nof great importance in doing so. In fact, the whole talk about the\nabsolute, almost the sole theme of philosophies since Kant, is nothing but\nthe cosmological proof _incognito_. This proof, in consequence of the case\nbrought against it by Kant, deprived of all right and declared outlawed,\ndare no longer show itself in its true form, and therefore appears in all\nkinds of disguises—now in distinguished form, concealed under intellectual\nintuition or pure thought; now as a suspicious vagabond, half begging,\nhalf demanding what it wants in more unpretending philosophemes. If an\nabsolute must absolutely be had, then I will give one which is far better\nfitted to meet all the demands which are made on such a thing than these\nvisionary phantoms; it is matter. It has no beginning, and it is\nimperishable; thus it is really independent, and _quod per se est et per\nse concipitur_; from its womb all proceeds, and to it all returns; what\nmore can be desired of an absolute? But to those with whom no critique of\nreason has succeeded, we should rather say—\n\n    “Are not ye like unto women, who ever\n    Return to the point from which they set out,\n    Though reason should have been talked by the hour?”\n\nThat the return to an unconditioned cause, to a first beginning, by no\nmeans lies in the nature of reason, is, moreover, practically proved by\nthe fact that the primitive religions of our race, which even yet have the\ngreatest number of followers upon earth, Brahmanism and Buddhaism, neither\nknow nor admit such assumptions, but carry the series of phenomena\nconditioning each other into infinity. Upon this point, I refer to the\nnote appended to the criticism of the first antinomy, which occurs further\non; and the reader may also see Upham’s “Doctrine of Buddhaism” (p. 9),\nand in general all genuine accounts of the religions of Asia. Judaism and\nreason ought not to be identified.\n\nKant, who by no means desires to maintain his pretended principle of\nreason as objectively valid, but merely as subjectively necessary, deduces\nit even as such only by means of a shallow sophism, p. 307; V. 364. He\nsays that because we seek to subsume every truth known to us under a more\ngeneral truth, as far as this process can be carried, this is nothing else\nthan the pursuit of the unconditioned, which we already presuppose. But,\nin truth, in this endeavour we do nothing more than apply reason, and\nintentionally make use of it to simplify our knowledge by enabling us to\nsurvey it—reason, which is that faculty of abstract, general knowledge\nthat distinguishes the reflective, thinking man, endowed with speech, from\nthe brute, which is the slave of the present. For the use of reason just\nconsists in this, that we know the particular through the universal, the\ncase through the rule, the rule through the more general rule; thus that\nwe seek the most general points of view. Through such survey or general\nview our knowledge is so facilitated and perfected that from it arises the\ngreat difference between the life of the brutes and that of men, and again\nbetween the life of educated and that of uneducated men. Now, certainly\nthe series of _grounds of knowledge_, which exist only in the sphere of\nthe abstract, thus of reason, always finds an end in what is\nindemonstrable, _i.e._, in an idea which is not further conditioned\naccording to this form of the principle of sufficient reason, thus in the\n_a priori_ or _a posteriori_ directly perceptible ground of the first\nproposition of the train of reasoning. I have already shown in the essay\non the principle of sufficient reason, § 50, that here the series of\ngrounds of knowledge really passes over into grounds of becoming or of\nbeing. But one can only desire to make this circumstance hold good as a\nproof of an unconditioned according to the law of causality, or even of\nthe mere demand for such an unconditioned, if one has not yet\ndistinguished the forms of the principle of sufficient reason at all, but,\nholding to the abstract expression, has confounded them all. Kant,\nhowever, seeks to establish that confusion, through a mere play upon\nwords, with _Universalitas_ and _Universitas_, p. 322; V. 379. Thus it is\nfundamentally false that our search for higher grounds of knowledge, more\ngeneral truths, springs from the presupposition of an object unconditioned\nin its being, or has anything whatever in common with this. Moreover, how\nshould it be essential to the reason to presuppose something which it must\nknow to be an absurdity as soon as it reflects? The source of that\nconception of the unconditioned is rather to be found only in the\nindolence of the individual who wishes by means of it to get rid of all\nfurther questions, whether his own or of others, though entirely without\njustification.\n\nNow Kant himself denies objective validity to this pretended principle of\nreason; he gives it, however, as a necessary subjective assumption, and\nthus introduces an irremediable split into our knowledge, which he soon\nallows to appear more clearly. With this purpose he unfolds that principle\nof reason further, p. 322; V. 379, in accordance with the method of\narchitectonic symmetry of which he is so fond. From the three categories\nof relation spring three kinds of syllogisms, each of which gives the clue\nfor the discovery of a special unconditioned, of which again there are\nthree: the soul, the world (as an object in itself and absolute totality),\nand God. Now here we must at once note a great contradiction, of which\nKant, however, takes no notice, because it would be very dangerous to the\nsymmetry. Two of these unconditioneds are themselves conditioned by the\nthird, the soul and the world by God, who is the cause of their existence.\nThus the two former have by no means the predicate of unconditionedness in\ncommon with the latter, though this is really the point here, but only\nthat of inferred being according to the principles of experience, beyond\nthe sphere of the possibility of experience.\n\nSetting this aside, we recognise in the three unconditioneds, to which,\naccording to Kant, reason, following its essential laws, must come, the\nthree principal subjects round which the whole of philosophy under the\ninfluence of Christianity, from the Scholastics down to Christian Wolf,\nhas turned. Accessible and familiar as these conceptions have become\nthrough all these philosophers, and now also through the philosophers of\npure reason, this by no means shows that, without revelation, they would\nnecessarily have proceeded from the development of all reason as a\nproduction peculiar to its very nature. In order to prove this it would be\nnecessary to call in the aid of historical criticism, and to examine\nwhether the ancient and non-European nations, especially the peoples of\nHindostan and many of the oldest Greek philosophers, really attained to\nthose conceptions, or whether it is only we who, by quite falsely\ntranslating the Brahma of the Hindus and the Tien of the Chinese as “God,”\ngood-naturedly attribute such conceptions to them, just as the Greeks\nrecognised their gods everywhere; whether it is not rather the case that\ntheism proper is only to be found in the religion of the Jews, and in the\ntwo religions which have proceeded from it, whose followers just on this\naccount comprise the adherents of all other religions on earth under the\nname of heathen, which, by the way, is a most absurd and crude expression,\nand ought to be banished at least from the writings of the learned,\nbecause it identifies and jumbles together Brahmanists, Buddhists,\nEgyptians, Greeks, Romans, Germans, Gauls, Iroquois, Patagonians,\nCaribbeans, Otaheiteans, Australians, and many others. Such an expression\nis all very well for priests, but in the learned world it must at once be\nshown the door: it can go to England and take up its abode at Oxford. It\nis a thoroughly established fact that Buddhism, the religion which numbers\nmore followers than any other on earth, contains absolutely no theism,\nindeed rejects it. As regards Plato, it is my opinion that he owes to the\nJews the theism with which he is periodically seized. On this account\nNumenius (according to Clem. Alex., _Strom._, i. c. 22, Euseb. _præp.\nevang._, xiii. 12, and Suidas under Numenius) called him the _Moses\ngræcisans_: Τι γαρ εστι Πλατων, η Μωσης αττικιζων; and he accuses him of\nhaving stolen (αποσυλησας) his doctrine of God and the creation from the\nMosaical writings. Clemens often repeats that Plato knew and made use of\nMoses, _e.g._, _Strom._, i. 25.—v. c. 14, § 90, &c., &c.; _Pædagog._, ii.\n10, and iii. 11; also in the _Cohortatio ad gentes_, c. 6, where, after he\nhas bitterly censured and derided the whole of the Greek philosophers in\nthe preceding chapter because they were not Jews, he bestows on Plato\nnothing but praise, and breaks out into pure exultation that as Plato had\nlearnt his geometry from the Egyptians, his astronomy from the\nBabylonians, magic from the Thracians, and much also from the Assyrians,\nso he had learnt his theism from the Jews: Οιδα σου τους διδασκαλους, καν\nαποκρυπτειν εθελῇς, ... δοξαν την του θεου παρ᾽ αυτων ωφελησει των Εβραιων\n(_Tuos magistros novi, licet eos celare velis, ... illa de Deo sententia\nsuppeditata tibi est ab Hebræis_). A pathetic scene of recognition. But I\nsee a remarkable confirmation of the matter in what follows. According to\nPlutarch (_in Mario_), and, better, according to Lactantius (i. 3, 19),\nPlato thanked Nature that he had been born a human being and not a brute,\na man and not a woman, a Greek and not a barbarian. Now in Isaac Euchel’s\n“Prayers of the Jews,” from the Hebrew, second edition, 1799, p. 7, there\nis a morning prayer in which God is thanked and praised that the\nworshipper was born a Jew and not a heathen, a free man and not a slave, a\nman and not a woman. Such an historical investigation would have spared\nKant an unfortunate necessity in which he now becomes involved, in that he\nmakes these three conceptions spring necessarily from the nature of\nreason, and yet explains that they are untenable and unverifiable by the\nreason, and thus makes the reason itself a sophisticator; for he says, p.\n339; V. 397: “There are sophistications, not of man, but of pure reason\nitself, from which even the wisest cannot free himself, and although after\nmuch trouble he may be able to avoid error, yet he never can escape from\nthe illusion which unceasingly torments and mocks him.” Therefore these\nKantian “Ideas of the Reason” might be compared to the focus in which the\nconverging reflected rays from a concave mirror meet several inches before\nits surface, in consequence of which, by an inevitable process of the\nunderstanding, an object presents itself to us there which is a thing\nwithout reality.\n\nBut the name “Idea” is very unfortunately chosen for these pretended\nnecessary productions of the pure theoretical reason, and violently\nappropriated from Plato, who used it to denote the eternal forms which,\nmultiplied through space and time, become partially visible in the\ninnumerable individual fleeting things. Plato’s “Ideas” are accordingly\nthroughout perceptible, as indeed the word which he chose so definitely\nsignifies, for it could only be adequately translated by means of\nperceptible or visible things; and Kant has appropriated it to denote that\nwhich lies so far from all possibility of perception that even abstract\nthought can only half attain to it. The word “Idea,” which Plato first\nintroduced, has, moreover, since then, through two-and-twenty centuries,\nalways retained the significance in which he used it; for not only all\nancient philosophers, but also all the Scholastics, and indeed the Church\nFathers and the theologians of the Middle Ages, used it only in that\nPlatonic sense, the sense of the Latin word _exemplar_, as Suarez\nexpressly mentions in his twenty-fifth Disputation, sect. 1. That\nEnglishmen and Frenchmen were later induced by the poverty of their\nlanguages to misuse this word is bad enough, but not of importance. Kant’s\nmisuse of the word idea, by the substitution of a new significance\nintroduced by means of the slender clue of not being object of experience,\nwhich it has in common with Plato’s ideas, but also in common with every\npossible chimera, is thus altogether unjustifiable. Now, since the misuse\nof a few years is not to be considered against the authority of many\ncenturies, I have always used the word in its old, original, Platonic\nsignificance.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nThe refutation of _rational psychology_ is much fuller and more thorough\nin the first edition of the “Critique of Pure Reason” than in the second\nand following editions, and therefore upon this point we must make use of\nthe first edition exclusively. This refutation has as a whole very great\nmerit and much truth. Yet I am clearly of the opinion that it was merely\nfrom his love of symmetry that Kant deduced as necessary the conception of\nthe soul from the paralogism of substantiality by applying the demand for\nthe unconditioned to the conception _substance_, which is the first\ncategory of relation, and accordingly maintained that the conception of a\nsoul arose in this way in every speculative reason. If this conception\nreally had its origin in the presupposition of a final subject of all\npredicates of a thing, one would have assumed a soul not in men alone, but\nalso just as necessarily in every lifeless thing, for such a thing also\nrequires a final subject of all its predicates. Speaking generally,\nhowever, Kant makes use of a quite inadmissible expression when he talks\nof something which can exist only as subject and not as predicate (_e.g._,\nCritique of Pure Reason, p. 323; V. 412; Prolegomena, § 4 and 47); though\na precedent for this is to be found in Aristotle’s “Metaphysics,” iv. ch.\n8. Nothing whatever exists as subject and predicate, for these expressions\nbelong exclusively to logic, and denote the relations of abstract\nconceptions to each other. Now their correlative or representative in the\nworld of perception must be substance and accident. But then we need not\nlook further for that which exists always as substance and never as\naccident, but have it directly in matter. It is the substance\ncorresponding to all properties of things which are their accidents. It\nis, in fact, if one wishes to retain the expression of Kant which has just\nbeen condemned, the final subject of all predicates of that empirically\ngiven thing, that which remains after the abstraction of all its\nproperties of every kind. And this holds good of man as of a brute, a\nplant, or a stone, and is so evident, that in order not to see it a\ndetermined desire not to see is required. That it is really the prototype\nof the conception substance, I will show soon. But subject and predicate\nare related to substance and accident rather as the principle of\nsufficient reason in logic to the law of causality in nature, and the\nsubstitution or identification of the former is just as inadmissible as\nthat of the latter. Yet in the “Prolegomena,” § 46, Kant carries this\nsubstitution and identification to its fullest extent in order to make the\nconception of the soul arise from that of the final subject of all\npredicates and from the form of the categorical syllogism. In order to\ndiscover the sophistical nature of this paragraph, one only needs to\nreflect that subject and predicate are purely logical determinations,\nwhich concern abstract conceptions solely and alone, and that according to\ntheir relation in the judgment. Substance and accident, on the other hand,\nbelong to the world of perception and its apprehension in the\nunderstanding, and are even there only as identical with matter and form\nor quality. Of this more shortly.\n\nThe antithesis which has given occasion for the assumption of two\nfundamentally different substances, body and soul, is in truth that of\nobjective and subjective. If a man apprehends himself objectively in\nexternal perception, he finds a being extended in space and in general\nmerely corporeal; but if, on the other hand, he apprehends himself in mere\nself-consciousness, thus purely subjectively, he finds himself a merely\nwilling and perceiving being, free from all forms of perception, thus also\nwithout a single one of the properties which belong to bodies. Now he\nforms the conception of the soul, like all the transcendental conceptions\ncalled by Kant Ideas, by applying the principle of sufficient reason, the\nform of all objects, to that which is not an object, and in this case\nindeed to the subject of knowing and willing. He treats, in fact, knowing,\nthinking, and willing as effects of which he seeks the cause, and as he\ncannot accept the body as their cause, he assumes a cause of them entirely\ndifferent from the body. In this manner the first and the last of the\ndogmatists proves the existence of the soul: Plato in the “Phædrus” and\nalso Wolf: from thinking and willing as the effects which lead to that\ncause. Only after in this way, by hypostatising a cause corresponding to\nthe effect, the conception of an immaterial, simple, indestructible being\nhad arisen, the school developed and demonstrated this from the conception\nof _substance_. But this conception itself they had previously constructed\nspecially for this purpose by the following artifice, which is worthy of\nnotice.\n\nWith the first class of ideas, _i.e._, the real world of perception, the\nidea of matter is also given; because the law governing this class of\nideas, the law of causality, determines the change of the states or\nconditions, and these conditions themselves presuppose something\npermanent, whose changes they are. When speaking above of the principle of\nthe permanence of substance, I showed, by reference to earlier passages,\nthat this idea of matter arises because in the understanding, for which\nalone it exists, time and space are intimately united, and the share of\nspace in this product exhibits itself as the permanence of matter, while\nthe share of time appears as the change of states. Purely in itself,\nmatter can only be thought _in abstracto_, and not perceived; for to\nperception it always appears already in form and quality. From this\nconception of _matter_, _substance_ is again an abstraction, consequently\na higher _genus_, and arose in this way. Of the conception of matter, only\nthe predicate of permanence was allowed to remain, while all its other\nessential properties, extension, impenetrability, divisibility, &c., were\nthought away. Like every higher _genus_, then, the concept _substance_\ncontains _less in itself_ than the concept _matter_, but, unlike every\nother higher _genus_, it does not contain _more under it_, because it does\nnot include several lower _genera_ besides matter; but this remains the\none true species of the concept substance, the only assignable thing by\nwhich its content is realised and receives a proof. Thus the aim with\nwhich in other cases the reason produces by abstraction a higher\nconception, in order that in it several subordinate species may be thought\nat once through common determinations, has here no place; consequently\nthat abstraction is either undertaken idly and entirely without aim, or it\nhas a secret secondary purpose. This secret purpose is now brought to\nlight; for under the conception substance, along with its true sub-species\nmatter, a second species is co-ordinated—the immaterial, simple,\nindestructible substance, soul. But the surreptitious introduction of this\nlast concept arose from the fact that the higher concept _substance_ was\nframed illogically, and in a manner contrary to law. In its legitimate\nprocedure the reason always frames the concept of a higher genus by\nplacing together the concepts of several species, and now comparing them,\nproceeds discursively, and by omitting their differences and retaining the\nqualities in which they agree, obtains the generic concept which includes\nthem all but has a smaller content. From this it follows that the concepts\nof the species must always precede the concept of the genus. But, in the\npresent case, the converse is true. Only the concept matter existed before\nthe generic concept _substance_. The latter was without occasion, and\nconsequently without justification, as it were aimlessly framed from the\nformer by the arbitrary omission of all its determinations except one. Not\ntill afterwards was the second ungenuine species placed beside the concept\nmatter, and so foisted in. But for the framing of this second concept\nnothing more was now required than an express denial of what had already\nbeen tacitly omitted in the higher generic concept, extension,\nimpenetrability, and divisibility. Thus the concept _substance_ was framed\nmerely to be the vehicle for the surreptitious introduction of the concept\nof the immaterial substance. Consequently, it is very far from being\ncapable of holding good as a category or necessary function of the\nunderstanding; rather is it an exceedingly superfluous concept, because\nits only true content lies already in the concept of matter, besides which\nit contains only a great void, which can be filled up by nothing but the\nillicitly introduced species _immaterial substance_; and, indeed, it was\nsolely for the purpose of containing this that it was framed. Accordingly,\nin strictness, the concept substance must be entirely rejected, and the\nconcept matter everywhere put in its place.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nThe categories were a procrustean bed for every possible thing, but the\nthree kinds of syllogisms are so only for the three so-called Ideas. The\nIdea of the soul was compelled to find its origin in the form of the\ncategorical syllogism. It is now the turn of the dogmatic ideas concerning\nthe universe, so far as it is thought as an object in itself, between two\nlimits—that of the smallest (atom), and that of the largest (limits of the\nuniverse in time and space). These must now proceed from the form of the\nhypothetical syllogism. Nor for this in itself is any special violence\nnecessary. For the hypothetical judgment has its form from the principle\nof sufficient reason, and not the cosmological alone but all those\nso-called Ideas really have their origin in the inconsiderate and\nunrestricted application of that principle, and the laying aside of it at\npleasure. For, in accordance with that principle, the mere dependence of\nan object upon another is ever sought for, till finally the exhaustion of\nthe imagination puts an end to the journey; and thus it is lost sight of\nthat every object, and indeed the whole chain of objects and the principle\nof sufficient reason itself, stand in a far closer and greater dependence,\nthe dependence upon the knowing subject, for whose objects alone, _i.e._,\nideas, that principle is valid, for their mere position in space and time\nis determined by it. Thus, since the form of knowledge from which here\nmerely the cosmological Ideas are derived, the principle of sufficient\nreason, is the source of all subtle hypostases, in this case no sophisms\nneed be resorted to; but so much the more is sophistry required in order\nto classify those Ideas according to the four titles of the categories.\n\n(1.) The cosmological Ideas with regard to time and space, thus of the\nlimits of the world in both, are boldly regarded as determined through the\ncategory of _quantity_, with which they clearly have nothing in common,\nexcept the accidental denotation in logic of the extent of the concept of\nthe subject in the judgment by the word _quantity_, a pictorial expression\ninstead of which some other might just as well have been chosen. But for\nKant’s love of symmetry this is enough. He takes advantage of the\nfortunate accident of this nomenclature, and links to it the transcendent\ndogmas of the world’s extension.\n\n(2.) Yet more boldly does Kant link to _quality_, _i.e._, the affirmation\nor negation in a judgment, the transcendent Ideas concerning matter; a\nprocedure which has not even an accidental similarity of words as a basis.\nFor it is just to the _quantity_, and not to the _quality_ of matter that\nits mechanical (not chemical) divisibility is related. But, what is more,\nthis whole idea of divisibility by no means belongs to those inferences\naccording to the principle of sufficient reason, from which, however, as\nthe content of the hypothetical form, all cosmological Ideas ought to\nflow. For the assertion upon which Kant there relies, that the relation of\nthe parts to the whole is that of the condition to the conditioned, thus a\nrelation according to the principle of sufficient reason, is certainly an\ningenious but yet a groundless sophism. That relation is rather based upon\nthe principle of contradiction; for the whole is not through the part, nor\nthe parts through the whole, but both are necessarily together because\nthey are one, and their separation is only an arbitrary act. It depends\nupon this, according to the principle of contradiction, that if the parts\nare thought away, the whole is also thought away, and conversely; and by\nno means upon the fact that the parts as the _reason_ conditioned the\nwhole as the _consequent_, and that therefore, in accordance with the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, we were necessarily led to seek the\nultimate parts, in order, as its reason, to understand from them the\nwhole. Such great difficulties are here overcome by the love of symmetry.\n\n(3.) The Idea of the first cause of the world would now quite properly\ncome under the title of _relation_; but Kant must reserve this for the\nfourth title, that of _modality_, for which otherwise nothing would\nremain, and under which he forces this idea to come by saying that the\ncontingent (_i.e._, according to his explanation, which is diametrically\nopposed to the truth, every consequent of its reason) becomes the\nnecessary through the first cause. Therefore, for the sake of symmetry,\nthe conception of _freedom_ appears here as the third Idea. By this\nconception, however, as is distinctly stated in the observations on the\nthesis of the third conflict, what is really meant is only that Idea of\nthe cause of the world which alone is admissible here. The third and\nfourth conflicts are at bottom tautological.\n\nAbout all this, however, I find and assert that the whole antinomy is a\nmere delusion, a sham fight. Only the assertions of the antitheses really\nrest upon the forms of our faculty of knowledge, _i.e._, if we express it\nobjectively, on the necessary, _a priori_ certain, most universal laws of\nnature. Their proofs alone are therefore drawn from objective grounds. On\nthe other hand, the assertions and proofs of the theses have no other than\na subjective ground, rest solely on the weakness of the reasoning\nindividual; for his imagination becomes tired with an endless regression,\nand therefore he puts an end to it by arbitrary assumptions, which he\ntries to smooth over as well as he can; and his judgment, moreover, is in\nthis case paralysed by early and deeply imprinted prejudices. On this\naccount the proof of the thesis in all the four conflicts is throughout a\nmere sophism, while that of the antithesis is a necessary inference of the\nreason from the laws of the world as idea known to us _a priori_. It is,\nmoreover, only with great pains and skill that Kant is able to sustain the\nthesis, and make it appear to attack its opponent, which is endowed with\nnative power. Now in this regard his first and constant artifice is, that\nhe does not render prominent the _nervus argumentationis_, and thus\npresent it in as isolated, naked, and distinct a manner as he possibly\ncan; but rather introduces the same argument on both sides, concealed\nunder and mixed up with a mass of superfluous and prolix sentences.\n\nThe theses and antitheses which here appear in such conflict remind one of\nthe δικαιος and αδικος λογος which Socrates, in the “Clouds” of\nAristophanes, brings forward as contending. Yet this resemblance extends\nonly to the form and not to the content, though this would gladly be\nasserted by those who ascribe to these most speculative of all questions\nof theoretical philosophy an influence upon morality, and therefore\nseriously regard the thesis as the δικαιος, and the antithesis as the\nαδικος λογος. I shall not, however, accommodate myself here with reference\nto such small, narrow, and perverse minds; and, giving honour not to them,\nbut to the truth, I shall show that the proofs which Kant adduced of the\nindividual theses are sophisms, while those of the antitheses are quite\nfairly and correctly drawn from objective grounds. I assume that in this\nexamination the reader has always before him the Kantian antinomy itself.\n\nIf the proof of the thesis in the first conflict is to be held as valid,\nthen it proves too much, for it would be just as applicable to time itself\nas to change in time, and would therefore prove that time itself must have\nhad a beginning, which is absurd. Besides, the sophism consists in this,\nthat instead of the beginninglessness of the series of states, which was\nat first the question, suddenly the endlessness (infinity) of the series\nis substituted; and now it is proved that this is logically contradicted\nby completeness, and yet every present is the end of the past, which no\none doubted. The end of a beginningless series can, however, always be\n_thought_, without prejudice to the fact that it has no beginning; just\nas, conversely, the beginning of an endless series can also be _thought_.\nBut against the real, true argument of the antithesis, that the changes of\nthe world necessarily presuppose an infinite series of changes\n_backwards_, absolutely nothing is advanced. We can think the possibility\nthat the causal chain will some day end in an absolute standstill, but we\ncan by no means think the possibility of an absolute beginning.(8)\n\nWith reference to the spatial limits of the world, it is proved that, if\nit is to be regarded as a _given whole_, it must necessarily have limits.\nThe reasoning is correct, only it was just the first link of it that was\nto be proved, and that remains unproved. Totality presupposes limits, and\nlimits presuppose totality; but here both together are arbitrarily\npresupposed. For this second point, however, the antithesis affords no\nsuch satisfactory proof as for the first, because the law of causality\nprovides us with necessary determinations only with reference to time, not\nto space, and affords us _a priori_ the certainty that no occupied time\ncan ever be bounded by a previous empty time, and that no change can be\nthe first change, but not that an occupied space can have no empty space\nbeside it. So far no _a priori_ decision on the latter point would be\npossible; yet the difficulty of conceiving the world in space as limited\nlies in the fact that space itself is necessarily infinite, and therefore\na limited finite world in space, however large it may be, becomes an\ninfinitely small magnitude; and in this incongruity the imagination finds\nan insuperable stumbling-block, because there remains for it only the\nchoice of thinking the world either as infinitely large or infinitely\nsmall. This was already seen by the ancient philosophers: Μητροδωρος, ὁ\nκαθηγητης Επικουρου, φηδιν ατοπον ειναι εν μεγαλῳ πεδιῳ ἑνα σταχυν\nγεννηθηναι, και ἑνα κοσμον εν τῳ απειρῳ (_Metrodorus, caput scholæ\nEpicuri, absurdum ait, in magno campo spicam unam produci, et unum in\ninfinito mundum_) Stob. Ecl., i. c. 23. Therefore many of them taught (as\nimmediately follows), απειρους κοσμους εν τῳ απειρῳ (_infinitos mundos in\ninfinito_). This is also the sense of the Kantian argument for the\nantithesis, only he has disfigured it by a scholastic and ambiguous\nexpression. The same argument might be used against the limitation of the\nworld in time, only we have a far better one under the guidance of\ncausality. In the case of the assumption of a world limited in space,\nthere arises further the unanswerable question, What advantage has the\nfilled part of space enjoyed over the infinite space that has remained\nempty? In the fifth dialogue of his book, “_Del Infinito, Universo e\nMondi_,” Giordano Bruno gives a full account of the arguments for and\nagainst the finiteness of the world, which is very well worth reading. For\nthe rest, Kant himself asserts seriously, and upon objective grounds, the\ninfinity of the world in space in his “Natural History of the Theory of\nthe Heavens,” part ii. ch. 7. Aristotle also acknowledges the same,\n“Phys.,” iii. ch. 4, a chapter which, together with the following one, is\nvery well worth reading with reference to this antinomy.\n\nIn the second conflict the thesis is at once guilty of a very palpable\n_petitio principii_, for it commences, “Every _compound_ substance\nconsists of simple parts.” From the compoundness here arbitrarily assumed,\nno doubt it afterwards very easily proves the simple parts. But the\nproposition, “All matter is compound,” which is just the point, remains\nunproved, because it is simply a groundless assumption. The opposite of\nsimple is not compound, but extended, that which has parts and is\ndivisible. Here, however, it is really tacitly assumed that the parts\nexisted before the whole, and were brought together, whence the whole has\narisen; for this is the meaning of the word “compound.” Yet this can just\nas little be asserted as the opposite. Divisibility means merely the\npossibility of separating the whole into parts, and not that the whole is\ncompounded out of parts and thus came into being. Divisibility merely\nasserts the parts _a parte post_; compoundness asserts them _a parte\nante_. For there is essentially no temporal relation between the parts and\nthe whole; they rather condition each other reciprocally, and thus always\nexist at the same time, for only so far as both are there is there\nanything extended in space. Therefore what Kant says in the observations\non the thesis, “Space ought not to be called a _compositum_, but a\n_totum_,” &c., holds good absolutely of matter also, which is simply space\nbecome perceptible. On the other hand, the infinite divisibility of\nmatter, which the antithesis asserts, follows _a priori_ and\nincontrovertibly from that of space, which it fills. This proposition has\nabsolutely nothing against it; and therefore Kant also (p. 513; V. 541),\nwhen he speaks seriously and in his own person, no longer as the\nmouthpiece of the αδικος λογος, presents it as objective truth; and also\nin the “Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science” (p. 108, first\nedition), the proposition, “Matter is infinitely divisible,” is placed at\nthe beginning of the proof of the first proposition of mechanics as\nestablished truth, having appeared and been proved as the fourth\nproposition in the Dynamics. But here Kant spoils the proof of the\nantithesis by the greatest obscurity of style and useless accumulation of\nwords, with the cunning intention that the evidence of the antithesis\nshall not throw the sophisms of the thesis too much into the shade. Atoms\nare no necessary thought of the reason, but merely an hypothesis for the\nexplanation of the difference of the specific gravity of bodies. But Kant\nhimself has shown, in the dynamics of his “Metaphysical First Principles\nof Natural Science,” that this can be otherwise, and indeed better and\nmore simply explained than by atomism. In this, however, he was\nanticipated by Priestley, “On Matter and Spirit,” sect. i. Indeed, even in\nAristotle, “Phys.” iv. 9, the fundamental thought of this is to be found.\n\nThe argument for the third thesis is a very fine sophism, and is really\nKant’s pretended principle of pure reason itself entirely unadulterated\nand unchanged. It tries to prove the finiteness of the series of causes by\nsaying that, in order to be _sufficient_, a cause must contain the\ncomplete sum of the conditions from which the succeeding state, the\neffect, proceeds. For the completeness of the determinations present\n_together_ in the state which is the cause, the argument now substitutes\nthe completeness of the series of causes by which that state itself was\nbrought to actuality; and because completeness presupposes the condition\nof being rounded off or closed in, and this again presupposes finiteness,\nthe argument infers from this a first cause, closing the series and\ntherefore unconditioned. But the juggling is obvious. In order to conceive\nthe state A. as the sufficient cause of the state B., I assume that it\ncontains the sum of the necessary determinations from the co-existence of\nwhich the estate B. inevitably follows. Now by this my demand upon it as a\n_sufficient_ cause is entirely satisfied, and has no direct connection\nwith the question how the state A. itself came to be; this rather belongs\nto an entirely different consideration, in which I regard the said state\nA. no more as cause, but as itself an effect; in which case another state\nagain must be related to it, just as it was related to B. The assumption\nof the finiteness of the series of causes and effects, and accordingly of\na first beginning, appears nowhere in this as necessary, any more than the\npresentness of the present moment requires us to assume a beginning of\ntime itself. It only comes to be added on account of the laziness of the\nspeculating individual. That this assumption lies in the acceptance of a\ncause as a _sufficient reason_ is thus unfairly arrived at and false, as I\nhave shown at length above when considering the Kantian principle of pure\nreason which coincides with this thesis. In illustration of the assertion\nof this false thesis, Kant is bold enough in his observations upon it to\ngive as an example of an unconditioned beginning his rising from his\nchair; as if it were not just as impossible for him to rise without a\nmotive as for a ball to roll without a cause. I certainly do not need to\nprove the baselessness of the appeal which, induced by a sense of\nweakness, he makes to the philosophers of antiquity, by quoting from\nOcellus Lucanus, the Eleatics, &c., not to speak of the Hindus. Against\nthe proof of this antithesis, as in the case of the previous ones, there\nis nothing to advance.\n\nThe fourth conflict is, as I have already remarked, really tautological\nwith the third; and the proof of the thesis is also essentially the same\nas that of the preceding one. His assertion that every conditioned\npresupposes a complete series of conditions, and therefore a series which\nends with an unconditioned, is a _petitio principii_, which must simply be\ndenied. Everything conditioned presupposes nothing but its condition; that\nthis is again conditioned raises a new consideration which is not directly\ncontained in the first.\n\nA certain appearance of probability cannot be denied to the antinomy; yet\nit is remarkable that no part of the Kantian philosophy has met so little\ncontradiction, indeed has found so much acceptance, as this exceedingly\nparadoxical doctrine. Almost all philosophical parties and text-books have\nregarded it as valid, and have also repeatedly reconstructed it; while\nnearly all Kant’s other doctrines have been contested, and indeed there\nhave never been wanting some perverse minds which rejected even the\ntranscendental æsthetic. The undivided assent which the antinomy, on the\nother hand, has met with may ultimately arise from the fact that certain\npersons regard with inward satisfaction the point at which the\nunderstanding is so thoroughly brought to a standstill, having hit upon\nsomething which at once is and is not, so that they actually have before\nthem here the sixth trick of Philadelphia in Lichtenberg’s broadsheet.\n\nIf we examine the real meaning of Kant’s _Critical Solution_ of the\ncosmological problem which now follows, we find that it is not what he\ngives it out to be, the solution of the problem by the disclosure that\nboth sides, starting from false assumptions, are wrong in the first and\nsecond conflicts, and that in the third and fourth both are right. It is\nreally the confirmation of the antitheses by the explanation of their\nassertions.\n\nFirst Kant asserts, in this solution, obviously wrongly, that both sides\nstarted from the assumption, as their first principle, that with the\nconditioned the completed (thus rounded off) _series_ of its conditions is\ngiven. Only the thesis laid down this proposition, Kant’s principle of\npure reason, as the ground of its assertions; the antithesis, on the other\nhand, expressly denied it throughout, and asserted the contrary. Further,\nKant charges both sides with this assumption, that the world exists in\nitself, _i.e._, independently of being known and of the forms of this\nknowledge, but this assumption also is only made by the thesis; indeed, it\nis so far from forming the ground of the assertions of the antithesis that\nit is absolutely inconsistent with them. For that it should all be given\nis absolutely contradictory of the conception of an infinite series. It is\ntherefore essential to it that it should always exist only with reference\nto the process of going through it, and not independently of this. On the\nother hand, in the assumption of definite limits also lies that of a whole\nwhich exists absolutely and independently of the process of completely\nmeasuring it. Thus it is only the thesis that makes the false assumption\nof a self-existent universe, _i.e._, a universe given prior to all\nknowledge, and to which knowledge came as to something external to itself.\nThe antithesis from the outset combats this assumption absolutely; for the\ninfinity of the series which it asserts merely under the guidance of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason can only exist if the regressus is fully\ncarried out, but not independently of it. As the object in general\npresupposes the subject, so also the object which is determined as an\n_endless_ chain of conditions necessarily presupposes in the subject the\nkind of knowledge corresponding to this, that is, the _constant following_\nof the links of that chain. But this is just what Kant gives as the\nsolution of the problem, and so often repeats: “The infinity of the world\nis only _through_ the regressus, not _before_ it.” This his solution of\nthe conflict is thus really only the decision in favour of the antithesis\nin the assertion of which this truth already lies, while it is altogether\ninconsistent with the assertions of the thesis. If the antithesis had\nasserted that the world consisted of infinite series of reasons and\nconsequents, and yet existed independently of the idea and its regressive\nseries, thus in itself, and therefore constituted a given whole, it would\nhave contradicted not only the thesis but also itself. For an infinite can\nnever be given as a whole, nor an _endless_ series exist, except as an\nendless progress; nor can what is boundless constitute a whole. Thus this\nassumption, of which Kant asserts that it led both sides into error,\nbelongs only to the thesis.\n\nIt is already a doctrine of Aristotle’s that an infinity can never be\n_actu_, _i.e._, actual and given, but only _potentiâ_. Ουκ εστιν ενεργειᾳ\nειναι το απειρον ... αλλ᾽ αδυνατον το εντελεχειᾳ ον απειρον (_infinitum\nnon potest esse actu: ... sed impossibile, actu esse infinitum_), Metaph.\nK. 10. Further: κατ᾽ ενεργειαν μεν γαρ ουδεν εστιν απειρον, δυναμει δε επι\nτην διαιρεσιν (_nihil enim actu infinitum est, sed potentia tantum, nempe\ndivisione ipsa_). _De generat. et corrupt._, i., 3. He develops this fully\nin the “Physics,” iii. 5 and 6, where to a certain extent he gives the\nperfectly correct solution of the whole of the antinomies. He expounds the\nantinomies in his short way, and then says, “A mediator (διαιτητου) is\nrequired;” upon which he gives the solution that the infinite, both of the\nworld in space and in time and in division, is never _before_ the\nregressus, or progressus, but in it. This truth lies then in the rightly\napprehended conception of the infinite. Thus one misunderstands himself if\nhe imagines that he can think the infinite, of whatever kind it may be, as\nsomething objectively present and complete, and independent of the\nregressus.\n\nIndeed if, reversing the procedure, we take as the starting-point what\nKant gives as the solution of the conflict, the assertion of the\nantithesis follows exactly from it. Thus: if the world is not an\nunconditioned whole and does not exist absolutely but only in the idea,\nand if its series of reasons and consequents do not exist _before_ the\nregressus of the ideas of them but only _through_ this regressus, then the\nworld cannot contain determined and finite series, because their\ndetermination and limitation would necessarily be independent of the idea,\nwhich would then only come afterwards; but all its series must be\ninfinite, _i.e._, inexhaustible by any idea.\n\nOn p. 506; V. 534, Kant tries to prove from the falseness of both sides\nthe transcendental ideality of the phenomenon, and begins, “If the world\nis a whole existing by itself, it is either finite or infinite.” But this\nis false; a whole existing of itself cannot possibly be infinite. That\nideality may rather be concluded from the infinity of the series in the\nworld in the following manner:—If the series of reasons and consequents in\nthe world are absolutely without end, the world cannot be a given whole\nindependent of the idea; for such a world always presupposes definite\nlimits, just as on the contrary infinite series presuppose an infinite\nregressus. Therefore, the presupposed infinity of the series must be\ndetermined through the form of reason and consequent, and this again\nthrough the form of knowledge of the subject; thus the world as it is\nknown must exist only in the idea of the subject.\n\nNow whether Kant himself was aware or not that his critical solution of\nthe problem is really a decision in favour of the antithesis, I am unable\nto decide. For it depends upon whether what Schelling has somewhere very\nhappily called Kant’s system of accommodation extended so far; or whether\nKant’s mind was here already involved in an unconscious accommodation to\nthe influence of his time and surroundings.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nThe solution of the third antinomy, the subject of which was the Idea of\nfreedom, deserves a special consideration, because it is for us very well\nworth notice that it is just here in connection with _the Idea of freedom_\nthat Kant is obliged to speak more fully of the _thing in itself_, which\nwas hitherto only seen in the background. This is very explicable to us\nsince we have recognised the thing in itself as the _will_. Speaking\ngenerally, this is the point at which the Kantian philosophy leads to\nmine, or at which mine springs out of his as its parent stem. One will be\nconvinced of this if one reads with attention pp. 536 and 537; V. 564 and\n565, of the “Critique of Pure Reason,” and, further, compares these\npassages with the introduction to the “Critique of Judgment,” pp. xviii.\nand xix. of the third edition, or p. 13 of Rosenkranz’s edition, where\nindeed it is said: “The conception of freedom can in its object (that is\nthen the will) present to the mind a thing in itself, but not in\nperception; the conception of nature, on the other hand, can present its\nobject to the mind in perception, but not as a thing in itself.” But\nspecially let any one read concerning the solution of the antinomies the\nfifty-third paragraph of the Prolegomena, and then honestly answer the\nquestion whether all that is said there does not sound like a riddle to\nwhich my doctrine is the answer. Kant never completed his thought; I have\nmerely carried out his work. Accordingly, what Kant says only of the human\nphenomenon I have extended to all phenomena in general, as differing from\nthe human phenomenon only in degree, that their true being is something\nabsolutely free, _i.e._, a will. It appears from my work how fruitful this\ninsight is in connection with Kant’s doctrine of the ideality of space,\ntime, and causality.\n\nKant has nowhere made the thing in itself the subject of a special\nexposition or distinct deduction; but, whenever he wants it, he introduces\nit at once by means of the conclusion that the phenomenon, thus the\nvisible world, must have a reason, an intelligible cause, which is not a\nphenomenon, and therefore belongs to no possible experience. He does this\nafter having assiduously insisted that the categories, and thus causality\nalso, had a use which was absolutely confined to possible experience; that\nthey were merely forms of the understanding, which served to spell out the\nphenomena of the world of sense, beyond which, on the other hand, they had\nno significance, &c., &c. Therefore, he denies in the most uncompromising\nmanner their application to things beyond experience, and rightly explains\nand at once rejects all earlier dogmatism as based upon the neglect of\nthis law. The incredible inconsistency which Kant here fell into was soon\nnoticed, and used by his first opponents to make attacks on his philosophy\nto which it could offer no resistance. For certainly we apply the law of\ncausality entirely _a priori_ and before all experience to the changes\nfelt in our organs of sense. But, on this very account, this law is just\nas much of subjective origin as these sensations themselves, and thus does\nnot lead to a thing in itself. The truth is, that upon the path of the\nidea one can never get beyond the idea; it is a rounded-off whole, and has\nin its own resources no clue leading to the nature of the thing in itself,\nwhich is _toto genere_ different from it. If we were merely perceiving\nbeings, the way to the thing in itself would be absolutely cut off from\nus. Only the other side of our own being can disclose to us the other side\nof the inner being of things. This path I have followed. But Kant’s\ninference to the thing in itself, contrary as it is to his own teaching,\nobtains some excuse from the following circumstance. He does not say, as\ntruth required, simply and absolutely that the object is conditioned by\nthe subject, and conversely; but only that the manner of the appearance of\nthe object is conditioned by the forms of knowledge of the subject, which,\ntherefore, also come _a priori_ to consciousness. But that now which in\nopposition to this is only known _a posteriori_ is for him the immediate\neffect of the thing in itself, which becomes phenomenon only in its\npassage through these forms which are given _a priori_. From this point of\nview it is to some extent explicable how it could escape him that\nobjectivity in general belongs to the form of the phenomenon, and is just\nas much conditioned by subjectivity in general as the mode of appearing of\nthe object is conditioned by the forms of knowledge of the subject; that\nthus if a thing in itself must be assumed, it absolutely cannot be an\nobject, which however he always assumes it to be, but such a thing in\nitself must necessarily lie in a sphere _toto genere_ different from the\nidea (from knowing and being known), and therefore could least of all be\narrived at through the laws of the combination of objects among\nthemselves.\n\nWith the proof of the thing in itself it has happened to Kant precisely as\nwith that of the _a priori_ nature of the law of causality. Both doctrines\nare true, but their proof is false. They thus belong to the class of true\nconclusions from false premises. I have retained them both, but have\nproved them in an entirely different way, and with certainty.\n\nThe thing in itself I have neither introduced surreptitiously nor inferred\naccording to laws which exclude it, because they really belong to its\nphenomenal appearance; nor, in general, have I arrived at it by roundabout\nways. On the contrary, I have shown it directly, there where it lies\nimmediately, in the will, which reveals itself to every one directly as\nthe in-itself of his own phenomenal being.\n\nAnd it is also this immediate knowledge of his own will out of which in\nhuman consciousness the conception of _freedom_ springs; for certainly the\nwill, as world-creating, as thing in itself, is free from the principle of\nsufficient reason, and therewith from all necessity, thus is completely\nindependent, free, and indeed almighty. Yet, in truth, this only holds\ngood of the will in itself, not of its manifestations, the individuals,\nwho, just through the will itself, are unalterably determined as its\nmanifestations in time. But in the ordinary consciousness, unenlightened\nby philosophy, the will is at once confused with its manifestation, and\nwhat belongs only to the former is attributed to the latter, whence arises\nthe illusion of the unconditioned freedom of the individual. Therefore\nSpinoza says rightly that if the projected stone had consciousness, it\nwould believe that it flew of its own free will. For certainly the\nin-itself of the stone also is the will, which alone is free; but, as in\nall its manifestations, here also, where it appears as a stone, it is\nalready fully determined. But of all this enough has already been said in\nthe text of this work.\n\nKant fails to understand and overlooks this immediate origin of the\nconception of freedom in every human consciousness, and therefore he now\nplaces (p. 533; V. 561) the source of that conception in a very subtle\nspeculation, through which the unconditioned, to which the reason must\nalways tend, leads us to hypostatise the conception of freedom, and it is\nonly upon this transcendent Idea of freedom that the practical conception\nof it is supposed to be founded. In the “Critique of Practical Reason,” §\n6, and p. 158 of the fourth and 235 of Rosenkranz’s edition, he yet\ndeduces this last conception differently by saying that the categorical\nimperative presupposes it. The speculative Idea is accordingly only the\nprimary source of the conception of freedom for the sake of this\npresupposition, but here it obtains both significance and application.\nNeither, however, is the case. For the delusion of a perfect freedom of\nthe individual in his particular actions is most lively in the conviction\nof the least cultivated man who has never reflected, and it is thus\nfounded on no speculation, although often assumed by speculation from\nwithout. Thus only philosophers, and indeed only the most profound of\nthem, are free from it, and also the most thoughtful and enlightened of\nthe writers of the Church.\n\nIt follows, then, from all that has been said, that the true source of the\nconception of freedom is in no way essentially an inference, either from\nthe speculative Idea of an unconditioned cause, nor from the fact that it\nis presupposed by the categorical imperative. But it springs directly from\nthe consciousness in which each one recognises himself at once as the\n_will_, _i.e._, as that which, as the thing in itself, has not the\nprinciple of sufficient reason for its form, and which itself depends upon\nnothing, but on which everything else rather depends. Every one, however,\ndoes not recognise himself at once with the critical and reflective\ninsight of philosophy as a determined manifestation of this will which has\nalready entered time, as we might say, an act of will distinguished from\nthat will to live itself; and, therefore, instead of recognising his whole\nexistence as an act of his freedom, he rather seeks for freedom in his\nindividual actions. Upon this point I refer the reader to my prize-essay\non the freedom of the will.\n\nNow if Kant, as he here pretends, and also apparently did in earlier\ncases, had merely inferred the thing in itself, and that with the great\ninconsistency of an inference absolutely forbidden by himself, what a\nremarkable accident would it then be that here, where for the first time\nhe approaches the thing in itself more closely and explains it, he should\nrecognise in it at once the _will_, the free will showing itself in the\nworld only in temporal manifestations! I therefore really assume, though\nit cannot be proved, that whenever Kant spoke of the thing in itself, in\nthe obscure depths of his mind he already always indistinctly thought of\nthe will. This receives support from a passage in the \n\nFor the rest, it is just this predetermined solution of the sham third\nconflict that affords Kant the opportunity of expressing very beautifully\nthe deepest thoughts of his whole philosophy. This is the case in the\nwhole of the “Sixth Section of the Antinomy of Pure Reason;” but, above\nall, in the exposition of the opposition between the empirical and the\nintelligible character, p. 534-550; V. 562-578, which I number among the\nmost admirable things that have ever been said by man. (As a supplemental\nexplanation of this passage, compare a parallel passage in the Critique of\nPractical Reason, p. 169-179 of the fourth edition, or p. 224-231 of\nRosenkranz’s edition.) It is yet all the more to be regretted that this is\nhere not in its right place, partly because it is not found in the way\nwhich the exposition states, and therefore could be otherwise deduced than\nit is, partly because it does not fulfil the end for which it is there—the\nsolution of the sham antinomy. The intelligible character, the thing in\nitself, is inferred from the phenomenon by the inconsistent use of the\ncategory of causality beyond the sphere of all phenomena, which has\nalready been sufficiently condemned. In this case the will of man (which\nKant entitles reason, most improperly, and with an unpardonable breach of\nall use of language) is set up as the thing in itself, with an appeal to\nan unconditioned ought, the categorical imperative, which is postulated\nwithout more ado.\n\nNow, instead of all this, the plain open procedure would have been to\nstart directly from the will, and prove it to be the in-itself of our own\nphenomenal being, recognised without any mediation; and then to give that\nexposition of the empirical and the intelligible character to explain how\nall actions, although necessitated by motives, yet, both by their author\nand by the disinterested judge, are necessarily and absolutely ascribed to\nthe former himself and alone, as depending solely upon him, to whom\ntherefore guilt and merit are attributed in respect of them. This alone\nwas the straight path to the knowledge of that which is not phenomenon,\nand therefore will not be found by the help of the laws of the phenomenon,\nbut is that which reveals itself through the phenomenon, becomes knowable,\nobjectifies itself—the will to live. It would then have had to be\nexhibited merely by analogy as the inner nature of every phenomenon. Then,\nhowever, it certainly could not have been said that in lifeless or even\nanimal nature no faculty can be thought except as sensuously conditioned\n(p. 546; V. 574), which in Kant’s language is simply saying that the\nexplanation, according to the law of causality, exhausts the inner nature\nof these phenomena, and thus in their case, very inconsistently, the thing\nin itself disappears. Through the false position and the roundabout\ndeduction according with it which the exposition of the thing in itself\nhas received from Kant, the whole conception of it has also become\nfalsified. For the will or the thing in itself, found through the\ninvestigation of an unconditioned cause, appears here related to the\nphenomenon as cause to effect. But this relation exists only within the\nphenomenal world, therefore presupposes it, and cannot connect the\nphenomenal world itself with what lies outside it, and is _toto genere_\ndifferent from it.\n\nFurther, the intended end, the solution of the third antinomy by the\ndecision that both sides, each in a different sense, are right, is not\nreached at all. For neither the thesis nor the antithesis have anything to\ndo with the thing in itself, but entirely with the phenomenon, the\nobjective world, the world as idea. This it is, and absolutely nothing\nelse, of which the thesis tries to show, by means of the sophistry we have\nlaid bare, that it contains unconditioned causes, and it is also this of\nwhich the antithesis rightly denies that it contains such causes.\nTherefore the whole exposition of the transcendental freedom of the will,\nso far as it is a thing in itself, which is given here in justification of\nthe thesis, excellent as it is in itself, is yet here entirely a μεταβασις\nεις αλλο γενος. For the transcendental freedom of the will which is\nexpounded is by no means the unconditioned causality of a cause, which the\nthesis asserts, because it is of the essence of a cause that it must be a\nphenomenon, and not something which lies beyond all phenomena and is _toto\ngenere_ different.\n\nIf what is spoken of is cause and effect, the relation of the will to the\nmanifestation (or of the intelligible character to the empirical) must\nnever be introduced, as happens here: for it is entirely different from\ncausal relation. However, here also, in this solution of the antinomy, it\nis said with truth that the empirical character of man, like that of every\nother cause in nature, is unalterably determined, and therefore that his\nactions necessarily take place in accordance with the external influences;\ntherefore also, in spite of all transcendental freedom (_i.e._,\nindependence of the will in itself of the laws of the connection of its\nmanifestation), no man has the power of himself to begin a series of\nactions, which, however, was asserted by the thesis. Thus also freedom has\nno causality; for only the will is free, and it lies outside nature or the\nphenomenon, which is just its objectification, but does not stand in a\ncausal relation to it, for this relation is only found within the sphere\nof the phenomenon, thus presupposes it, and cannot embrace the phenomenon\nitself and connect it with what is expressly not a phenomenon. The world\nitself can only be explained through the will (for it is the will itself,\nso far as it manifests itself), and not through causality. But _in the\nworld_ causality is the sole principle of explanation, and everything\nhappens simply according to the laws of nature. Thus the right lies\nentirely on the side of the antithesis, which sticks to the question in\nhand, and uses that principle of explanation which is valid with regard to\nit; therefore it needs no apology. The thesis, on the other hand, is\nsupposed to be got out of the matter by an apology, which first passes\nover to something quite different from the question at issue, and then\nassumes a principle of explanation which is inapplicable to it.\n\nThe fourth conflict is, as has already been said, in its real meaning\ntautological with the third. In its solution Kant develops still more the\nuntenable nature of the thesis; while for its truth, on the other hand,\nand its pretended consistency with the antithesis, he advances no reason,\nas conversely he is able to bring no reason against the antithesis. The\nassumption of the thesis he introduces quite apologetically, and yet calls\nit himself (p. 562; V. 590) an arbitrary presupposition, the object of\nwhich might well in itself be impossible, and shows merely an utterly\nimpotent endeavour to find a corner for it somewhere where it will be safe\nfrom the prevailing might of the antithesis, only to avoid disclosing the\nemptiness of the whole of his once-loved assertion of the necessary\nantinomy in human reason.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nNow follows the chapter on the transcendental ideal, which carries us back\nat once to the rigid Scholasticism of the Middle Ages. One imagines one is\nlistening to Anselm of Canterbury himself. The _ens realissimum_, the\nessence of all realities, the content of all affirmative propositions,\nappears, and indeed claims to be a necessary thought of the reason. I for\nmy part must confess that to my reason such a thought is impossible, and\nthat I am not able to think anything definite in connection with the words\nwhich denote it.\n\nMoreover, I do not doubt that Kant was compelled to write this\nextraordinary chapter, so unworthy of him, simply by his fondness for\narchitectonic symmetry. The three principal objects of the Scholastic\nphilosophy (which, as we have said, if understood in the wider sense, may\nbe regarded as continuing down to Kant), the soul, the world, and God, are\nsupposed to be deduced from the three possible major propositions of\nsyllogisms, though it is plain that they have arisen, and can arise,\nsimply and solely through the unconditioned application of the principle\nof sufficient reason. Now, after the soul had been forced into the\ncategorical judgment, and the hypothetical was set apart for the world,\nthere remained for the third Idea nothing but the disjunctive major.\nFortunately there existed a previous work in this direction, the _ens\nrealissimum_ of the Scholastics, together with the ontological proof of\nthe existence of God set up in a rudimentary form by Anselm of Canterbury\nand then perfected by Descartes. This was joyfully made use of by Kant,\nwith some reminiscence also of an earlier Latin work of his youth.\nHowever, the sacrifice which Kant makes to his love of architectonic\nsymmetry in this chapter is exceedingly great. In defiance of all truth,\nwhat one must regard as the grotesque idea of an essence of all possible\nrealities is made an essential and necessary thought of the reason. For\nthe deduction of this Kant makes use of the false assertion that our\nknowledge of particular things arises from a progressive limitation of\ngeneral conceptions; thus also of a most general conception of all which\ncontains all reality _in itself_. In this he stands just as much in\ncontradiction with his own teaching as with the truth, for exactly the\nconverse is the case. Our knowledge starts with the particular and is\nextended to the general, and all general conceptions arise by abstraction\nfrom real, particular things known by perception, and this can be carried\non to the most general of all conceptions, which includes everything under\nit, but almost nothing _in it_. Thus Kant has here placed the procedure of\nour faculty of knowledge just upside down, and thus might well be accused\nof having given occasion to a philosophical charlatanism that has become\nfamous in our day, which, instead of recognising that conceptions are\nthoughts abstracted from things, makes, on the contrary the conceptions\nfirst, and sees in things only concrete conceptions, thus bringing to\nmarket the world turned upside down as a philosophical buffoonery, which\nof course necessarily found great acceptance.\n\nEven if we assume that every reason must, or at least can, attain to the\nconception of God, even without revelation, this clearly takes place only\nunder the guidance of causality. This is so evident that it requires no\nproof. Therefore Chr. Wolf says (_Cosmologia Generalis, prœf._, p. 1):\n_Sane in theologia naturali existentiam Numinis e principiis cosmologicis\ndemonstramus. Contingentia universi et ordinis naturæ, una cum\nimpossibilitate casus, sunt scala, per quam a mundo hoc adspectabili ad\nDeum ascenditur._ And, before him, Leibnitz said, in connection with the\nlaw of causality: _Sans ce grand principe on ne saurait venir à la preuve\nde l’existence de Dieu_. On the other hand, the thought which is worked\nout in this chapter is so far from being essential and necessary to\nreason, that it is rather to be regarded as a veritable masterpiece of the\nmonstrous productions of an age which, through strange circumstances, fell\ninto the most singular aberrations and perversities, such as the age of\nthe Scholastics was—an age which is unparalleled in the history of the\nworld, and can never return again. This Scholasticism, as it advanced to\nits final form, certainly derived the principal proof of the existence of\nGod from the conception of the _ens realissimum_, and only then used the\nother proofs as accessory. This, however, is mere methodology, and proves\nnothing as to the origin of theology in the human mind. Kant has here\ntaken the procedure of Scholasticism for that of reason—a mistake which\nindeed he has made more than once. If it were true that according to the\nessential laws of reason the Idea of God proceeds from the disjunctive\nsyllogism under the form of an Idea of the most real being, this Idea\nwould also have existed in the philosophy of antiquity; but of the _ens\nrealissimum_ there is nowhere a trace in any of the ancient philosophers,\nalthough some of them certainly teach that there is a Creator of the\nworld, yet only as the giver of form to the matter which exists without\nhim, δεμιουργος, a being whom they yet infer simply and solely in\naccordance with the law of causality. It is true that Sextus Empiricus\n(_adv. Math._, ix. § 88) quotes an argument of Cleanthes, which some have\nheld to be the ontological proof. This, however, it is not, but merely an\ninference from analogy; because experience teaches that upon earth one\nbeing is always better than another, and man, indeed, as the best, closes\nthe series, but yet has many faults; therefore there must exist beings who\nare still better, and finally one being who is best of all (κρατιστον,\nαριστον), and this would be God.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nOn the detailed refutation of speculative theology which now follows I\nhave only briefly to remark that it, and in general the whole criticism of\nthe three so-called Ideas of reason, thus the whole Dialectic of Pure\nReason, is indeed to a certain extent the goal and end of the whole work:\nyet this polemical part has not really an absolutely universal, permanent,\nand purely philosophical interest, such as is possessed by the preceding\ndoctrinal part, _i.e._, the æsthetic and analytic; but rather a temporary\nand local interest, because it stands in a special relation to the leading\npoints of the philosophy which prevailed in Europe up till the time of\nKant, the complete overthrow of which was yet, to his immortal credit,\nachieved by him through this polemic. He has eliminated theism from\nphilosophy; for in it, as a science and not a system of faith, only that\ncan find a place which is either empirically given or established by valid\nproofs. Naturally we only mean here the real seriously understood\nphilosophy which is concerned with the truth, and nothing else; and by no\nmeans the jest of philosophy taught in the universities, in which, after\nKant as before him, speculative theology plays the principal part, and\nwhere, also, after as before him, the soul appears without ceremony as a\nfamiliar person. For it is the philosophy endowed with salaries and fees,\nand, indeed, also with titles of Hofrath, which, looking proudly down from\nits height, remains for forty years entirely unaware of the existence of\nlittle people like me, and would be thoroughly glad to be rid of the old\nKant with his Critiques, that they might drink the health of Leibnitz with\nall their hearts. It is further to be remarked here, that as Kant was\nconfessedly led to his doctrine of the _a priori_ nature of the conception\nof causality by Hume’s scepticism with regard to that conception, it may\nbe that in the same way Kant’s criticism of all speculative theology had\nits occasion in Hume’s criticism of all popular theology, which he had\ngiven in his “Natural History of Religion,” a book so well worth reading,\nand in the “Dialogues on Natural Religion.” Indeed, it may be that Kant\nwished to a certain extent to supplement this. For the first-named work of\nHume is really a critique of popular theology, the pitiable condition of\nwhich it seeks to show; while, on the other hand, it points to rational or\nspeculative theology as the genuine, and that which is worthy of respect.\nBut Kant now discloses the groundlessness of the latter, and leaves, on\nthe other hand, popular theology untouched, nay, even establishes it in a\nnobler form as a faith based upon moral feeling. This was afterwards\ndistorted by the philosophasters into rational apprehensions,\nconsciousness of God, or intellectual intuitions of the supersensible, of\nthe divine, &c., &c.; while Kant, as he demolished old and revered errors,\nand knew the danger of doing so, rather wished through the moral theology\nmerely to substitute a few weak temporary supports, so that the ruin might\nnot fall on him, but that he might have time to escape.\n\nNow, as regards the performance of the task, no critique of reason was\nnecessary for the refutation of the _ontological_ proof of the existence\nof God; for without presupposing the æsthetic and analytic, it is quite\neasy to make clear that that ontological proof is nothing but a subtle\nplaying with conceptions which is quite powerless to produce conviction.\nThere is a chapter in the “_Organon_” of Aristotle which suffices as fully\nfor the refutation of the ontological proof as if it had been written\nintentionally with that purpose. It is the seventh chapter of the second\nbook of the “_Analyt. Post._” Among other things, it is expressly said\nthere: “το δε ειναι ουκ ουσια ουδενι,” _i.e._, _existentia nunquam ad\nessentiam rei pertinet_.\n\nThe refutation of the _cosmological_ proof is an application to a given\ncase of the doctrine of the Critique as expounded up to that point, and\nthere is nothing to be said against it. The _physico-theological_ proof is\na mere amplification of the cosmological, which it presupposes, and it\nfinds its full refutation only in the “Critique of Judgment.” I refer the\nreader in this connection to the rubric, “Comparative Anatomy,” in my work\non the Will in Nature.\n\nIn the criticism of this proof Kant has only to do, as we have already\nsaid, with speculative theology, and limits himself to the School. If, on\nthe contrary, he had had life and popular theology also in view, he would\nhave been obliged to add a fourth proof to the three he has\nconsidered—that proof which is really the effective one with the great\nmass of men, and which in Kant’s technical language might best be called\nthe _keraunological_. It is the proof which is founded upon the needy,\nimpotent, and dependent condition of man as opposed to natural forces,\nwhich are infinitely superior, inscrutable, and for the most part\nthreatening evil; to which is added man’s natural inclination to personify\neverything, and finally the hope of effecting something by prayers and\nflattery, and even by gifts. In every human undertaking there is something\nwhich is not in our power and does not come within our calculations; the\nwish to win this for oneself is the origin of the gods. “_Primus in orbe\nDeos fecit timor_” is an old and true saying of Petronius. It is\nprincipally this proof which is criticised by Hume, who throughout appears\nas Kant’s forerunner in the writings referred to above. But those whom\nKant has placed in a position of permanent embarrassment by his criticism\nof speculative theology are the professors of philosophy. Salaried by\nChristian governments, they dare not give up the chief article of\nfaith.(9) Now, how do these gentlemen help themselves? They simply declare\nthat the existence of God is self-evident. Indeed! After the ancient\nworld, at the expense of its conscience, had worked miracles to prove it,\nand the modern world, at the expense of its understanding, had brought\ninto the field ontological, cosmological, and physico-theological\nproofs—to these gentlemen it is self-evident. And from this self-evident\nGod they then explain the world: that is their philosophy.\n\nTill Kant came there was a real dilemma between materialism and theism,\n_i.e._, between the assumption that a blind chance, or that an\nintelligence working from without in accordance with purposes and\nconceptions, had brought about the world, _neque dabatur tertium_.\nTherefore atheism and materialism were the same; hence the doubt whether\nthere really could be an atheist, _i.e._, a man who really could attribute\nto blind chance the disposition of nature, so full of design, especially\norganised nature. See, for example, Bacon’s Essays (_sermones fideles_),\nEssay 16, on Atheism. In the opinion of the great mass of men, and of the\nEnglish, who in such things belong entirely to the great mass (the mob),\nthis is still the case, even with their most celebrated men of learning.\nOne has only to look at Owen’s “_Ostéologie Comparée_,” of 1855, \n\nIn the chapter on the ultimate aim of the natural dialectic of reason it\nis asserted that the three transcendent Ideas are of value as regulative\nprinciples for the advancement of the knowledge of nature. But Kant can\nbarely have been serious in making this assertion. At least its opposite,\nthat these assumptions are restrictive and fatal to all investigation of\nnature, is to every natural philosopher beyond doubt. To test this by an\nexample, let any one consider whether the assumption of the soul as an\nimmaterial, simple, thinking substance would have been necessarily\nadvantageous or in the highest degree impeding to the truths which Cabanis\nhas so beautifully expounded, or to the discoveries of Flourens, Marshall\nHall, and Ch. Bell. Indeed Kant himself says (_Prolegomena_, § 44), “The\nIdeas of the reason are opposed and hindering to the maxims of the\nrational knowledge of nature.”\n\nIt is certainly not the least merit of Frederick the Great, that under his\nGovernment Kant could develop himself, and dared to publish the “Critique\nof Pure Reason.” Hardly under any other Government would a salaried\nprofessor have ventured such a thing. Kant was obliged to promise the\nimmediate successor of the great king that he would write no more.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nI might consider that I could dispense with the criticism of the ethical\npart of the Kantian philosophy here because I have given a detailed and\nthorough criticism of it twenty-two years later than the present work in\nthe “_Beiden Grundproblemen der Ethik_.” However, what is here retained\nfrom the first edition, and for the sake of completeness must not be\nomitted, may serve as a suitable introduction to that later and much more\nthorough criticism, to which in the main I therefore refer the reader.\n\nOn account of Kant’s love of architectonic symmetry, the theoretical\nreason had also to have a _pendant_. The _intellectus practicus_ of the\nScholastics, which again springs from the νους πρακτικος of Aristotle (_De\nAnima_, iii. 10, and _Polit._, vii. c. 14: ὁ μεν γαρ πρακτικος εστι λογος,\nὁ δε θεωρητικος), provides the word ready made. Yet here something quite\ndifferent is denoted by it—not as there, the reason directed to technical\nskill. Here the practical reason appears as the source and origin of the\nundeniable ethical significance of human action, and of all virtue, all\nnobleness, and every attainable degree of holiness. All this accordingly\nshould come from mere _reason_, and demand nothing but this. To act\nrationally and to act virtuously, nobly, holily, would be one and the\nsame; and to act selfishly, wickedly, viciously, would be merely to act\nirrationally. However, all times and peoples and languages have\ndistinguished the two, and held them to be quite different things; and so\ndoes every one even at the present day who knows nothing of the language\nof the new school, _i.e._, the whole world, with the exception of a small\ncompany of German _savants_. Every one but these last understands by\nvirtuous conduct and a rational course of life two entirely different\nthings. To say that the sublime founder of the Christian religion, whose\nlife is presented to us as the pattern of all virtue, was _the most\nrational_ of all men would be called a very unbecoming and even a\nblasphemous way of speaking; and almost as much so if it were said that\nHis precepts contained all the best directions for a perfectly _rational\nlife_. Further, that he who, in accordance with these precepts, instead of\ntaking thought for his own future needs, always relieves the greater\npresent wants of others, without further motive, nay, gives all his goods\nto the poor, in order then, destitute of all means of subsistence, to go\nand preach to others also the virtue which he practises himself; this\nevery one rightly honours; but who ventures to extol it as the highest\npitch of _reasonableness_? And finally, who praises it as a _rational_\ndeed that Arnold von Winkelried, with surpassing courage, clasped the\nhostile spears against his own body in order to gain victory and\ndeliverance for his countrymen? On the other hand, if we see a man who\nfrom his youth upwards deliberates with exceptional foresight how he may\nprocure for himself an easy competence, the means for the support of wife\nand children, a good name among men, outward honour and distinction, and\nin doing so never allows himself to be led astray or induced to lose sight\nof his end by the charm of present pleasures or the satisfaction of\ndefying the arrogance of the powerful, or the desire of revenging insults\nand undeserved humiliations he has suffered, or the attractions of useless\naesthetic or philosophical occupations of the mind, or travels in\ninteresting lands, but with great consistency works towards his one\nend,—who ventures to deny that such a philistine is in quite an\nextraordinary degree _rational_, even if he has made use of some means\nwhich are not praiseworthy but are yet without danger? Nay, more, if a bad\nman, with deliberate shrewdness, through a well-thought-out plan attains\nto riches and honours, and even to thrones and crowns, and then with the\nacutest cunning gets the better of neighbouring states, overcomes them one\nby one, and now becomes a conqueror of the world, and in doing so is not\nled astray by any respect for right, any sense of humanity, but with sharp\nconsistency tramples down and dashes to pieces everything that opposes his\nplan, without compassion plunges millions into misery of every kind,\ncondemns millions to bleed and die, yet royally rewards and always\nprotects his adherents and helpers, never forgetting anything, and thus\nreaches his end,—who does not see that such a man must go to work in a\nmost rational manner?—that, as a powerful understanding was needed to form\nthe plans, their execution demanded the complete command of the _reason_,\nand indeed properly of _practical reason_? Or are the precepts which the\nprudent and consistent, the thoughtful and far-seeing Machiavelli\nprescribes to the prince _irrational_?(10)\n\nAs wickedness is quite consistent with reason, and indeed only becomes\nreally terrible in this conjunction, so, conversely, nobleness is\nsometimes joined with want of reason. To this may be attributed the action\nof Coriolanus, who, after he had applied all his strength for years to the\naccomplishment of his revenge upon the Romans, when at length the time\ncame, allowed himself to be softened by the prayers of the Senate and the\ntears of his mother and wife, gave up the revenge he had so long and so\npainfully prepared, and indeed, by thus bringing on himself the just anger\nof the Volscians, died for those very Romans whose thanklessness he knew\nand desired so intensely to punish. Finally, for the sake of completeness,\nit may be mentioned that reason may very well exist along with want of\nunderstanding. This is the case when a foolish maxim is chosen, but is\nfollowed out consistently. An example of this is afforded by the case of\nthe Princess Isabella, daughter of Philip II., who vowed that she would\nnot put on a clean chemise so long as Ostend remained unconquered, and\nkept her word through three years. In general all vows are of this class,\nwhose origin is a want of insight as regards the law of causality, _i.e._,\nwant of understanding; nevertheless it is rational to fulfil them if one\nis of such narrow understanding as to make them.\n\nIn agreement with what we have said, we see the writers who appeared just\nbefore Kant place the conscience, as the seat of the moral impulses, in\nopposition to the reason. Thus Rousseau, in the fourth book of “_Emile_,”\nsays: “_La raison nous trompe, mais la conscience ne trompe jamais_;” and\nfurther on: “_Il est impossible d’expliquer par les conséquences de notre\nnature le principe immédiat de la conscience indépendant de la raison\nmême_.” Still further: “_Mes sentimens naturels parlaient pour l’intérêt\ncommun, ma raison rapportait tout a moi.... On a beau vouloir etablir la\nvertu __ par la raison seul, quelle solide base peut-on lui donner_?” In\nthe “_Rêveries du Promeneur_,” prom. 4 ême, he says: “_Dans toutes les\nquestions de morale difficiles je me suis tojours bien trouvé de les\nrésoudre par le dictamen de la conscience, plutôt que par les lumières de\nla raison_.” Indeed Aristotle already says expressly (_Eth. Magna_, i. 5)\nthat the virtues have their seat in the αλογῳ μοριῳ της ψυχης (_in parte\nirrationali animi_), and not in the λογον εχοντι (_in parte rationali_).\nIn accordance with this, Stobæus says (Ecl., ii, c.7), speaking of the\nPeripatetics: “Την ηθικην αρετην ὑπολαμβανουσι περι το αλογον μερος\nγιγνεσθαι της ψυχης, επειδη διμερη προς την παρουσαν θεωριαν ὑπεθεντο την\nψυχην, το μεν λογικον εχουσαν, το δ᾽ αλογον. Και περι μεν το λογικον την\nκαλοκαγαθιαν γιγνεσθαν, και την φρονησιν, και την αγχινοιαν, και σοφιαν,\nκαι ευμαθειαν, και μνημην, και τας ὁμοιους; περι δε το αλογον, σωφροσυνην,\nκαι δικαιοσυνην, και ανδρειαν, και τας αλλας τας ηθικας καλουμενας\nαρετας.” (_Ethicam virtutem circa partem animæ ratione carentem versari\nputant, cam duplicem, ad hanc disquisitionem, animam ponant, ratione\npræditam, et ea carentem. In parte vero ratione prædita collocant\ningenuitatem, prudentiam, perspicacitatem, sapientiam, docilitatem,\nmemoriam et reliqua; in parte vero ratione destituta temperantiam,\njustitiam, fortitadinem, et reliquas virtutes, quas ethicas vocant._) And\nCicero (_De Nat. Deor._, iii., c. 26-31) explains at length that reason is\nthe necessary means, the tool, of all crime.\n\nI have explained _reason_ to be the _faculty of framing concepts_. It is\nthis quite special class of general non-perceptible ideas, which are\nsymbolised and fixed only by words, that distinguishes man from the brutes\nand gives him the pre-eminence upon earth. While the brute is the slave of\nthe present, and knows only immediate sensible motives, and therefore when\nthey present themselves to it is necessarily attracted or repelled by\nthem, as iron is by the magnet, in man, on the contrary, deliberation has\nbeen introduced through the gift of reason.\n\nThis enables him easily to survey as a whole his life and the course of\nthe world, looking before and after; it makes him independent of the\npresent, enables him to go to work deliberately, systematically, and with\nforesight, to do evil as well as to do good. But what he does he does with\ncomplete self-consciousness; he knows exactly how his will decides, what\nin each case he chooses, and what other choice was in the nature of the\ncase possible; and from this self-conscious willing he comes to know\nhimself and mirrors himself in his actions. In all these relations to the\nconduct of men reason is to be called _practical_; it is only theoretical\nso far as the objects with which it is concerned have no relation to the\naction of the thinker, but have purely a theoretical interest, which very\nfew men are capable of feeling. What in this sense is called _practical\nreason_ is very nearly what is signified by the Latin word _prudentia_,\nwhich, according to Cicero (_De Nat. Deor._ ii., 22), is a contraction of\n_providentia_; while, on the other hand, _ratio_, if used of a faculty of\nthe mind, signifies for the most part theoretical reason proper, though\nthe ancients did not observe the distinction strictly. In nearly all men\nreason has an almost exclusively practical tendency; but if this also is\nabandoned thought loses the control of action, so that it is then said,\n“_Scio meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor_,” or “_Le matin je fais des\nprojets, et le soir je fais des sottises_.” Thus the man does not allow\nhis conduct to be guided by his thought, but by the impression of the\nmoment, after the manner of the brute; and so he is called irrational\n(without thereby imputing to him moral turpitude), although he is not\nreally wanting in reason, but in the power of applying it to his action;\nand one might to a certain extent say his reason is theoretical and not\npractical. He may at the same time be a really good man, like many a one\nwho can never see any one in misfortune without helping him, even making\nsacrifices to do so, and yet leaves his debts unpaid. Such an irrational\ncharacter is quite incapable of committing great crimes, because the\nsystematic planning, the discrimination and self-control, which this\nalways requires are quite impossible to him. Yet, on the other hand, he\nwill hardly attain to a very high degree of virtue, for, however much\ninclined to good he may be by nature, those single vicious and wicked\nemotions to which every one is subject cannot be wanting; and where reason\ndoes not manifest itself practically, and oppose to them unalterable\nmaxims and firm principles, they must become deeds.\n\nFinally, _reason_ manifests itself very specially as _practical_ in those\nexceedingly rational characters who on this account are called in ordinary\nlife practical philosophers, and who are distinguished by an unusual\nequanimity in disagreeable as in pleasing circumstances, an equable\ndisposition, and a determined perseverance in resolves once made. In fact,\nit is the predominance of reason in them, _i.e._, the more abstract than\nintuitive knowledge, and therefore the survey of life by means of\nconceptions, in general and as a whole, which has enabled them once for\nall to recognise the deception of the momentary impression, the fleeting\nnature of all things, the shortness of life, the emptiness of pleasures,\nthe fickleness of fortune, and the great and little tricks of chance.\nTherefore nothing comes to them unexpectedly, and what they know in the\nabstract does not surprise nor disturb them when it meets them in the\nactual and in the particular case, though it does so in the case of those\nless reasonable characters upon whom the present, the perceptible, the\nactual, exerts such an influence that the cold, colourless conceptions are\nthrown quite into the background of consciousness, and forgetting\nprinciples and maxims, they are abandoned to emotions and passions of\nevery kind. I have already explained at the end of the first book that in\nmy opinion the ethics of Stoicism were simply a guide to a truly\nreasonable life, in this sense. Such a life is also repeatedly praised by\nHorace in very many passages. This is the significance of his _nil\nadmirari_, and also of the Delphic Μηδεν αγαν. To translate _nil admirari_\n“to admire nothing” is quite wrong. This Horatian maxim does not concern\nthe theoretical so much as the practical, and its real meaning is: “Prize\nno object unconditionally. Do not fall in love with anything; do not\nbelieve that the possession of anything can give you happiness. Every\nintense longing for an object is only a delusive chimera, which one may\njust as well, and much more easily, get quit of by fuller knowledge as by\nattained possession.” Cicero also uses _admirari_ in this sense (_De\nDivinatione_, ii. 2). What Horace means is thus the αθαμβια and\nακαταπληξις, also αθαυμασια, which Democritus before him prized as the\nhighest good (see _Clem. Alex. Strom._, ii. 21, and cf. _Strabo_, i. p. 98\nand 105). Such reasonableness of conduct has properly nothing to do with\nvirtue and vice; but this practical use of reason is what gives man his\npre-eminence over the brute, and only in this sense has it any meaning and\nis it permissible to speak of a dignity of man.\n\nIn all the cases given, and indeed in all conceivable cases, the\ndistinction between rational and irrational action runs back to the\nquestion whether the motives are abstract conceptions or ideas of\nperception. Therefore the explanation which I have given of reason agrees\nexactly with the use of language at all times and among all peoples—a\ncircumstance which will not be regarded as merely accidental or arbitrary,\nbut will be seen to arise from the distinction of which every man is\nconscious, of the different faculties of the mind, in accordance with\nwhich consciousness he speaks, though certainly he does not raise it to\nthe distinctness of an abstract definition. Our ancestors did not make the\nwords without attaching to them a definite meaning, in order, perhaps,\nthat they might lie ready for philosophers who might possibly come\ncenturies after and determine what ought to be thought in connection with\nthem; but they denoted by them quite definite conceptions. Thus the words\nare no longer unclaimed, and to attribute to them an entirely different\nsense from that which they have hitherto had means to misuse them, means\nto introduce a licence in accordance with which every one might use any\nword in any sense he chose, and thus endless confusion would necessarily\narise. Locke has already shown at length that most disagreements in\nphilosophy arise from a false use of words. For the sake of illustration\njust glance for a moment at the shameful misuse which philosophers\ndestitute of thoughts make at the present day of the words substance,\nconsciousness, truth, and many others. Moreover, the utterances and\nexplanations concerning reason of all philosophers of all ages, with the\nexception of the most modern, agree no less with my explanation of it than\nthe conceptions which prevail among all nations of that prerogative of\nman. Observe what Plato, in the fourth book of the Republic, and in\ninnumerable scattered passages, calls the λογιμον, or λογιστικον της\nψυχης, what Cicero says (_De Nat. Deor._, iii. 26-31), what Leibnitz and\nLocke say upon this in the passages already quoted in the first book.\nThere would be no end to the quotations here if one sought to show how all\nphilosophers before Kant have spoken of reason in general in my sense,\nalthough they did not know how to explain its nature with complete\ndefiniteness and distinctness by reducing it to one point. What was\nunderstood by reason shortly before Kant’s appearance is shown in general\nby two essays of Sulzer in the first volume of his miscellaneous\nphilosophical writings, the one entitled “Analysis of the Conception of\nReason,” the other, “On the Reciprocal Influence of Reason and Language.”\nIf, on the other hand, we read how reason is spoken about in the most\nrecent times, through the influence of the Kantian error, which after him\nincreased like an avalanche, we are obliged to assume that the whole of\nthe wise men of antiquity, and also all philosophers before Kant, had\nabsolutely no reason at all; for the immediate perceptions, intuitions,\napprehensions, presentiments of the reason now discovered were as utterly\nunknown to them as the sixth sense of the bat is to us. And as far as I am\nconcerned, I must confess that I also, in my weakness, cannot comprehend\nor imagine that reason which directly perceives or apprehends, or has an\nintellectual intuition of the super-sensible, the absolute, together with\nlong yarns that accompany it, in any other way than as the sixth sense of\nthe bat. This, however, must be said in favour of the invention or\ndiscovery of such a reason, which at once directly perceives whatever you\nchoose, that it is an incomparable expedient for withdrawing oneself from\nthe affair in the easiest manner in the world, along with one’s favourite\nideas, in spite of all Kants, with their Critiques of Reason. The\ninvention and the reception it has met with do honour to the age.\n\nThus, although what is essential in reason (το λογιμον, ἡ φρονησις,\n_ratio_, _raison_, Vernunft) was, on the whole and in general, rightly\nunderstood by all philosophers of all ages, though not sharply enough\ndefined nor reduced to one point, yet it was not so clear to them what the\nunderstanding (νους, διανοια, _intellectus_, _esprit_, Verstand) is.\nTherefore they often confuse it with reason, and just on this account they\ndid not attain to a thoroughly complete, pure, and simple explanation of\nthe nature of the latter. With the Christian philosophers the conception\nof reason received an entirely extraneous, subsidiary meaning through the\nopposition of it to revelation. Starting, then, from this, many are justly\nof opinion that the knowledge of the duty of virtue is possible from mere\nreason, _i.e._, without revelation. Indeed this aspect of the matter\ncertainly had influence upon Kant’s exposition and language. But this\nopposition is properly of positive, historical significance, and is\ntherefore for philosophy a foreign element, from which it must keep itself\nfree.\n\nWe might have expected that in his critiques of theoretical and practical\nreason Kant would have started with an exposition of the nature of reason\nin general, and, after he had thus defined the _genus_, would have gone on\nto the explanation of the two _species_, showing how one and the same\nreason manifests itself in two such different ways, and yet, by retaining\nits principal characteristic, proves itself to be the same. But we find\nnothing of all this. I have already shown how inadequate, vacillating, and\ninconsistent are the explanations of the faculty he is criticising, which\nhe gives here and there by the way in the “Critique of Pure Reason.” The\n_practical_ reason appears in the “Critique of Pure Reason” without any\nintroduction, and afterwards stands in the “Critique” specially devoted to\nitself as something already established. No further account of it is\ngiven, and the use of language of all times and peoples, which is treated\nwith contempt, and the definitions of the conception given by the greatest\nof earlier philosophers, dare not lift up their voices. In general, we may\nconclude from particular passages that Kant’s opinion amounts to this: the\nknowledge of principles _a priori_ is the essential characteristic of\nreason: since now the knowledge of the ethical significance of action is\nnot of empirical origin, it also is an _a priori_ principle, and\naccordingly proceeds from the reason, and therefore thus far the reason is\n_practical_. I have already spoken enough of the incorrectness of this\nexplanation of reason. But, independently of this, how superficial it is,\nand what a want of thoroughness it shows, to make use here of the single\nquality of being independent of experience in order to combine the most\nheterogeneous things, while overlooking their most essential and\nimmeasurable difference in other respects. For, even assuming, though we\ndo not admit it, that the knowledge of the ethical significance of action\nsprings from an imperative lying in us, an unconditioned _ought_, yet how\nfundamentally different would such an imperative be from those universal\n_forms of knowledge_ of which, in the “Critique of Pure Reason,” Kant\nproves that we are conscious _a priori_, and by virtue of which\nconsciousness we can assert beforehand an unconditioned _must_, valid for\nall experience possible for us. But the difference between this _must_,\nthis necessary form of all objects which is already determined in the\nsubject, and that _ought_ of morality is so infinitely great and palpable\nthat the mere fact that they agree in the one particular that neither of\nthem is empirically known may indeed be made use of for the purpose of a\nwitty comparison, but not as a philosophical justification for regarding\ntheir origin as the same.\n\nMoreover, the birthplace of this child of practical reason, the _absolute\nought_ or the categorical imperative, is not in the “Critique of Practical\nReason,” but in that of “Pure Reason,” p. 802; V. 830. The birth is\nviolent, and is only accomplished by means of the forceps of a\n_therefore_, which stands boldly and audaciously, indeed one might say\nshamelessly, between two propositions which are utterly foreign to each\nother and have no connection, in order to combine them as reason and\nconsequent. Thus, that not merely perceptible but also abstract motives\ndetermine us, is the proposition from which Kant starts, expressing it in\nthe following manner: “Not merely what excites, _i.e._, what affects the\nsenses directly, determines human will, but we have a power of overcoming\nthe impressions made upon our sensuous appetitive faculty through ideas of\nthat which is itself in a more remote manner useful or hurtful. These\ndeliberations as to what is worthy of desire, with reference to our whole\ncondition, _i.e._, as to what is good and useful, rest upon reason.”\n(Perfectly right; would that he only always spoke so rationally of\nreason!) “Reason _therefore_ gives! also laws, which are imperatives,\n_i.e._, objective laws of freedom, and say what ought to take place,\nthough perhaps it never does take place”! Thus, without further\nauthentication, the categorical imperative comes into the world, in order\nto rule there with its unconditioned _ought_—a sceptre of wooden iron. For\nin the conception “_ought_” there lies always and essentially the\nreference to threatened punishment, or promised reward, as a necessary\ncondition, and cannot be separated from it without abolishing the\nconception itself and taking all meaning from it. Therefore an\n_unconditioned ought_ is a _contradictio in adjecto_. It was necessary to\ncensure this mistake, closely as it is otherwise connected with Kant’s\ngreat service to ethics, which consists in this, that he has freed ethics\nfrom all principles of the world of experience, that is, from all direct\nor indirect doctrines of happiness, and has shown in a quite special\nmanner that the kingdom of virtue is not of this world. This service is\nall the greater because all ancient philosophers, with the single\nexception of Plato, thus the Peripatetics, the Stoics, and the Epicureans,\nsought by very different devices either to make virtue and happiness\ndependent on each other in accordance with the principle of sufficient\nreason, or to identify them in accordance with the principle of\ncontradiction. This charge applies with equal force to all modern\nphilosophers down to Kant. His merit in this respect is therefore very\ngreat; yet justice demands that we should also remember here first that\nhis exposition and elaboration often does not correspond with the tendency\nand spirit of his ethics, and secondly that, even so, he is not really the\nfirst who separated virtue from all principles of happiness. For Plato,\nespecially in the “Republic,” the principal tendency of which is just\nthis, expressly teaches that virtue is to be chosen for itself alone, even\nif unhappiness and ignominy are inevitably connected with it. Still more,\nhowever, Christianity preaches a perfectly unselfish virtue, which is\npractised not on account of the reward in a life after death, but quite\ndisinterestedly from love to God, for works do not justify, but only\nfaith, which accompanies virtue, so to speak, as its symptom, and\ntherefore appears quite irrespective of reward and of its own accord. See\nLuther’s “_De Libertate Christiana_.” I will not take into account at all\nthe Indians, in whose sacred books the hope of a reward for our works is\neverywhere described as the way of darkness, which can never lead to\nblessedness. Kant’s doctrine of virtue, however, we do not find so pure;\nor rather the exposition remains far behind the spirit of it, and indeed\nfalls into inconsistency. In his _highest good_, which he afterwards\ndiscussed, we find virtue united to happiness. The ought originally so\nunconditioned does yet afterwards postulate one condition, in order to\nescape from the inner contradiction with which it is affected and with\nwhich it cannot live. Happiness in the highest good is not indeed really\nmeant to be the motive for virtue; yet there it is, like a secret article,\nthe existence of which reduces all the rest to a mere sham contract. It is\nnot really the reward of virtue, but yet it is a voluntary gift for which\nvirtue, after work accomplished, stealthily opens the hand. One may\nconvince oneself of this from the “Critique of Practical Reason” (p.\n223-266 of the fourth, or p. 264-295 of Rosenkranz’s, edition). The whole\nof Kant’s moral theology has also the same tendency, and just on this\naccount morality really destroys itself through moral theology. For I\nrepeat that all virtue which in any way is practised for the sake of a\nreward is based upon a prudent, methodical, far-seeing egoism.\n\nThe content of the absolute ought, the fundamental principle of the\npractical reason, is the famous: “So act that the maxim of your will might\nalways be also valid as the principle of a universal legislation.” This\nprinciple presents to him who desires a rule for his own will the task of\nseeking such a rule for the wills of all. Then the question arises how\nsuch a rule is to be found. Clearly, in order to discover the rule of my\nconduct, I ought not to have regard to myself alone, but to the sum of all\nindividuals. Then, instead of my own well-being, the well-being of all\nwithout distinction becomes my aim. Yet the aim still always remains\nwell-being. I find, then, that all can be equally well off only if each\nlimits his own egoism by that of others. From this it certainly follows\nthat I must injure no one, because, since this principle is assumed to be\nuniversal, I also will not be injured. This, however, is the sole ground\non account of which I, who do not yet possess a moral principle, but am\nonly seeking one, can wish this to be a universal law. But clearly in this\nway the desire of well-being, _i.e._, egoism, remains the source of this\nethical principle. As the basis of politics it would be excellent, as the\nbasis of ethics it is worthless. For he who seeks to establish a rule for\nthe wills of all, as is demanded by that moral principle, necessarily\nstands in need of a rule himself; otherwise everything would be alike to\nhim. But this rule can only be his own egoism, since it is only this that\nis affected by the conduct of others; and therefore it is only by means of\nthis egoism, and with reference to it, that each one can have a will\nconcerning the conduct of others, and that it is not a matter of\nindifference to him. Kant himself very naively intimates this (p. 123 of\nthe “Critique of Practical Reason;” Rosenkranz’s edition, p. 192), where\nhe thus prosecutes the search for maxims for the will: “If every one\nregarded the need of others with complete indifference, _and thou also\ndidst belong_ to such an order of things, wouldst thou consent thereto?”\n_Quam temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam!_ would be the rule of the\nconsent inquired after. So also in the “Fundamental Principles of the\nMetaphysic of Morals” (p. 56 of the third, and p. 50 of Rosenkranz’s,\nedition): “A will which resolved to assist no one in distress would\ncontradict itself, for cases might arise in which _it required the love\nand sympathy of others_,” &c. &c. This principle of ethics, which when\nlight is thrown upon it is therefore nothing else than an indirect and\ndisguised expression of the old, simple principle, “_Quod tibi fieri non\nvis, alteri ne feceris_,” is related first and directly to passivity,\nsuffering, and then only by means of this to action. Therefore, as we have\nsaid, it would be thoroughly serviceable as a guide for the constitution\nof the State, which aims at the prevention of _the suffering of wrong_,\nand also desires to procure for all and each the greatest sum of\nwell-being. But in ethics, where the object of investigation is _action_\nas _action_, and in its direct significance for the _actor_—not its\nconsequences, suffering, or its relation to others—in this reference, I\nsay, it is altogether inadmissible, because at bottom it really amounts to\na principle of happiness, thus to egoism.\n\nWe cannot, therefore, share Kant’s satisfaction that his principle of\nethics is not a material one, _i.e._, one which sets up an object as a\nmotive, but merely formal, whereby it corresponds symmetrically to the\nformal laws with which the “Critique of Pure Reason” has made us familiar.\nCertainly it is, instead of a law, merely a formula for finding such a\nlaw. But, in the first place, we had this formula already more briefly and\nclearly in the “_Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris_;” and,\nsecondly, the analysis of this formula shows that it is simply and solely\nthe reference to one’s own happiness that gives it content, and therefore\nit can only be serviceable to a rational egoism, to which also every legal\nconstitution owes its origin.\n\nAnother mistake which, because it offends the feelings of every one, has\noften been condemned, and was satirised by Schiller in an epigram, is the\npedantic rule that for an act to be really good and meritorious it must be\ndone simply and solely out of respect for the known law and the conception\nof duty, and in accordance with a maxim known to the reason _in\nabstracto_, and not from any inclination, not from benevolence felt\ntowards others, not from tender-hearted compassion, sympathy, or emotion\nof the heart, which (according to the “Critique of Practical Reason,” p.\n213; Rosenkranz’s edition, p. 257) to right-thinking persons are indeed\nvery burdensome, as confusing their deliberate maxims. The act must be\nperformed unwillingly and with self-compulsion. Remember that nevertheless\nthe hope of reward is not allowed to enter, and estimate the great\nabsurdity of the demand. But, what is saying more, this is directly\nopposed to the true spirit of virtue; not the act, but the willingness to\ndo it, the love from which it proceeds, and without which it is a dead\nwork, constitutes its merit. Therefore Christianity rightly teaches that\nall outward works are worthless if they do not proceed from that genuine\ndisposition which consists in true goodwill and pure love, and that what\nmakes blessed and saves is not the works done (_opera operata_), but the\nfaith, the genuine disposition, which is the gift of the Holy Ghost alone,\nand which the free, deliberative will, having only the law in view, does\nnot produce. This demand of Kant’s, that all virtuous conduct shall\nproceed from pure, deliberate respect for the law and in accordance with\nits abstract maxims, coldly and without inclination, nay, opposed to all\ninclination, is just the same thing as if he asserted that every work of\nart must be accomplished by a well-considered application of æsthetical\nrules. The one is just as perverse as the other. The question, already\nhandled by Plato and Seneca, whether virtue can be taught, is to be\nanswered in the negative. We must finally make up our minds to see, what\nindeed was the source of the Christian doctrine of election by grace, that\nas regards its chief characteristic and its inner nature, virtue, like\ngenius, is to a certain extent inborn; and that just as little as all the\nprofessors of æsthetics could impart to any one the power of producing\nworks of genius, _i.e._, genuine works of art, so little could all the\nprofessors of ethics and preachers of virtue transform an ignoble into a\nvirtuous and noble character, the impossibility of which is very much more\napparent than that of turning lead into gold. The search for a system of\nethics and a first principle of the same, which would have practical\ninfluence and would actually transform and better the human race, is just\nlike the search for the philosopher’s stone. Yet I have spoken at length\nat the end of the fourth book of the possibility of an entire change of\nmind or conversion of man (new birth), not by means of abstract (ethics)\nbut of intuitive knowledge (the work of grace). The \n\nThat Kant by no means penetrated to the real significance of the ethical\ncontent of actions is shown finally by his doctrine of the highest good as\nthe necessary combination of virtue and happiness, a combination indeed in\nwhich virtue would be that which merits happiness. He is here involved in\nthe logical fallacy that the conception of merit, which is here the\nmeasure or test, already presupposes a theory of ethics as its own\nmeasure, and thus could not be deducible from it. It appeared in our\nfourth book that all genuine virtue, after it has attained to its highest\ngrade, at last leads to a complete renunciation in which all willing finds\nan end. Happiness, on the other hand, is a satisfied wish; thus the two\nare essentially incapable of being combined. He who has been enlightened\nby my exposition requires no further explanation of the complete\nperverseness of this Kantian view of the highest good. And, independent of\nmy positive exposition, I have no further negative exposition to give.\n\nKant’s love of architectonic symmetry meets us also in the “Critique of\nPractical Reason,” for he has given it the shape of the “Critique of Pure\nReason,” and has again introduced the same titles and forms with manifest\nintention, which becomes specially apparent in the table of the categories\nof freedom.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nThe “Philosophy of Law” is one of Kant’s latest works, and is so poor\nthat, although I entirely disagree with it, I think a polemic against it\nis superfluous, since of its own weakness it must die a natural death,\njust as if it were not the work of this great man, but the production of\nan ordinary mortal. Therefore, as regards the “Philosophy of Law,” I give\nup the negative mode of procedure and refer to the positive, that is, to\nthe short outline of it given in the fourth book. Just one or two general\nremarks on Kant’s “Philosophy of Law” may be made here. The errors which I\nhave condemned in considering the “Critique of Pure Reason,” as clinging\nto Kant throughout, appear in the “Philosophy of Law” in such excess that\none often believes he is reading a satirical parody of the Kantian style,\nor at least that he is listening to a Kantian. Two principal errors,\nhowever, are these. He desires (and many have since then desired) to\nseparate the Philosophy of Law sharply from ethics, and yet not to make\nthe former dependent upon positive legislation, _i.e._, upon arbitrary\nsanction, but to let the conception of law exist for itself pure and _a\npriori_. But this is not possible; because conduct, apart from its ethical\nsignificance, and apart from the physical relation to others, and thereby\nfrom external sanction, does not admit even of the possibility of any\nthird view. Consequently, when he says, “Legal obligation is that which\n_can_ be enforced,” this _can_ is either to be understood physically, and\nthen all law is positive and arbitrary, and again all arbitrariness that\nachieves its end is law; or the _can_ is to be understood ethically, and\nwe are again in the province of ethics. With Kant the conception of legal\nright hovers between heaven and earth, and has no ground on which to\nstand; with me it belongs to ethics. Secondly, his definition of the\nconception law is entirely negative, and thereby inadequate.(11) Legal\nright is that which is consistent with the compatibility of the respective\nfreedom of individuals together, according to a general law. Freedom (here\nthe empirical, _i.e._, physical, not the moral freedom of the will)\nsignifies not being hindered or interfered with, and is thus a mere\nnegation; compatibility, again, has exactly the same significance. Thus we\nremain with mere negations and obtain no positive conception, indeed do\nnot learn at all, what is really being spoken about, unless we know it\nalready from some other source. In the course of the exposition the most\nperverse views afterwards develop themselves, such as that in the state of\nnature, _i.e._, outside the State, there is no right to property at all,\nwhich really means that all right or law is positive, and involves that\nnatural law is based upon positive law, instead of which the case ought to\nbe reversed. Further, the founding of legal acquisition on possession; the\nethical obligation to establish the civil constitution; the ground of the\nright of punishment, &c., &c., all of which, as I have said, I do not\nregard as worth a special refutation. However, these Kantian errors have\nexercised a very injurious influence. They have confused and obscured\ntruths long known and expressed, and have occasioned strange theories and\nmuch writing and controversy. This certainly cannot last, and we see\nalready how truth and sound reason again make way for themselves. Of the\nlatter, the “_Naturrecht_” of J. C. F. Meister specially bears evidence,\nand is thus a contrast to many a preposterous theory, though I do not\nregard it as on this account a pattern of perfection.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nOn the “Critique of Judgment” also, after what has been said, I must be\nvery short. We cannot but be surprised that Kant, to whom art certainly\nwas very foreign, and who to all appearance had little susceptibility for\nthe beautiful, indeed probably never had the opportunity of seeing an\nimportant work of art, and who seems, finally, to have had no knowledge of\nGoethe, the only man of his century and nation who was fit to be placed by\nhis side as his giant equal,—it is, I say, surprising how, notwithstanding\nall this, Kant was able to render a great and permanent service to the\nphilosophical consideration of art and the beautiful. His merit lies in\nthis, that much as men had reflected upon the beautiful and upon art, they\nhad yet really always considered it only from the empirical point of view,\nand had investigated upon a basis of facts what quality distinguished the\nobject of any kind which was called beautiful from other objects of the\nsame kind. On this path they first arrived at quite special principles,\nand then at more general ones. They sought to separate true artistic\nbeauty from false, and to discover marks of this genuineness, which could\nthen serve again as rules. What gives pleasure as beautiful and what does\nnot, what therefore is to be imitated, what is to be striven against, what\nis to be avoided, what rules, at least negative rules, are to be\nestablished, in short, what are the means of exciting æsthetic\nsatisfaction, _i.e._, what are the conditions of this residing in the\nobject—this was almost exclusively the theme of all treatises upon art.\nThis path was followed by Aristotle, and in the most recent times we find\nit chosen by Home, Burke, Winckelmann, Lessing, Herder, and many others.\nIt is true that the universality of the æsthetical principles discovered\nfinally led back to the subject, and it was observed that if the effect\nupon the subject were adequately known we would then also be able to\ndetermine _a priori_ the causes of this which lie in the object, and thus\nalone this method of treatment could attain to the certainty of a science.\nThis occasioned once and again psychological disquisitions. Specially\nhowever, Alexander Baumgarten produced with this intention a general\næsthetic of all beauty, in which he started from the conception of the\nperfection of sensuous knowledge, that is, of knowledge of perception.\nWith him also, however, the subjective part is done with as soon as this\nconception has been established, and he passes on to the objective part\nand to the practical, which is connected with it. But here also the merit\nwas reserved for Kant of investigating seriously and profoundly _the\nfeeling itself_, in consequence of which we call the object occasioning it\nbeautiful, in order to discover, wherever it was possible, the constituent\nelements and conditions of it in our nature. His investigation, therefore,\ntook an entirely subjective direction. This path was clearly the right\none, for in order to explain a phenomenon which is given in its effects,\none must know accurately this effect itself, if one is to determine\nthoroughly the nature of the cause. Yet Kant’s merit in this regard does\nnot really extend much further than this, that he has indicated the right\npath, and by a provisional attempt has given an example of how, more or\nless, it is to be followed. For what he gave cannot be regarded as\nobjective truth and as a real gain. He gave the method for this\ninvestigation, he broke ground in the right direction, but otherwise he\nmissed the mark.\n\nIn the “Critique of Æsthetical Judgment” the observation first of all\nforces itself upon us that Kant retains the method which is peculiar to\nhis whole philosophy, and which I have considered at length above—I mean\nthe method of starting from abstract knowledge in order to establish\nknowledge of perception, so that the former serves him, so to speak, as a\n_camera obscura_ in which to receive and survey the latter. As in the\n“Critique of Pure Reason” the forms of judgment are supposed to unfold to\nhim the knowledge of our whole world of perception, so in this “Critique\nof Æsthetical Judgment” he does not start from the beautiful itself, from\nthe perceptible and immediately beautiful, but from the _judgment_ of the\nbeautiful, the so-called, and very badly so-called, judgment of taste.\nThis is his problem. His attention is especially aroused by the\ncircumstance that such a judgment is clearly the expression of something\nthat takes place in the subject, but yet is just as universally valid as\nif it concerned a quality of the object. It is this that struck him, not\nthe beautiful itself. He starts always merely from the assertions of\nothers, from the judgment of the beautiful, not from the beautiful itself.\nIt is therefore as if he knew it simply from hearsay, not directly. A\nblind man of high understanding could almost in the same way make up a\ntheory of colours from very accurate reports which he had heard concerning\nthem. And really we can only venture to regard Kant’s philosophemes\nconcerning the beautiful as in almost the same position. Then we shall\nfind that his theory is very ingenious indeed, that here and there telling\nand true observations are made; but his real solution of the problem is so\nvery insufficient, remains so far below the dignity of the subject, that\nit can never occur to us to accept it as objective truth. Therefore I\nconsider myself relieved from the necessity of refuting it; and here also\nI refer to the positive part of my work.\n\nWith regard to the form of his whole book, it is to be observed that it\noriginated in the idea of finding in the teleological conception the key\nto the problem of the beautiful. This inspiration is deduced, which is\nalways a matter of no difficulty, as we have learnt from Kant’s\nsuccessors. Thus there now arises the strange combination of the knowledge\nof the beautiful with that of the teleology of natural bodies in _one_\nfaculty of knowledge called _judgment_, and the treatment of these two\nheterogeneous subjects in one book. With these three powers of knowledge,\nreason, judgment, and understanding, a variety of\nsymmetrical-architectonic amusements are afterwards undertaken, the\ngeneral inclination to which shows itself in many ways in this book; for\nexample, in the forcible adaptation of the whole of it to the pattern of\nthe “Critique of Pure Reason,” and very specially in the antinomy of the\næsthetical judgment, which is dragged in by the hair. One might also\nextract a charge of great inconsistency from the fact that after it has\nbeen incessantly repeated in the “Critique of Pure Reason” that the\nunderstanding is the faculty of judgment, and after the forms of its\njudgment have been made the foundation-stone of all philosophy, a quite\nspecial faculty of judgment now appears, which is completely different\nfrom the former. For the rest, what I call the faculty of judgment, the\ncapacity for translating knowledge of perception into abstract knowledge,\nand again of applying the latter correctly to the former, is explained in\nthe positive part of my work.\n\nBy far the best part of the “Critique of Æsthetical Judgment” is the\ntheory of the sublime. It is incomparably more successful than that of the\nbeautiful, and does not only give, as that does, the general method of\ninvestigation, but also a part of the right way to it—so much so that even\nthough it does not give the real solution of the problem, it yet touches\nvery closely upon it.\n\nIn the “Critique of the Teleological Judgment,” on account of the\nsimplicity of the matter, we can recognise perhaps more than anywhere else\nKant’s rare talent of turning a thought this way and that way, and\nexpressing it in a multitude of different ways, until out of it there\ngrows a book. The whole book is intended to say this alone: although\norganised bodies necessarily appear to us as if they were constructed in\naccordance with a conceived design of an end which preceded them, yet we\nare not justified in assuming that this is objectively the case. For our\nintellect, to which things are given from without and indirectly, which\nthus never knows their inner nature through which they arise and exist,\nbut merely their outward side, cannot otherwise comprehend a certain\nquality peculiar to organised productions of nature than by analogy, for\nit compares it with the intentionally accomplished works of man, the\nnature of which is determined by a design and the conception of this\ndesign. This analogy is sufficient to enable us to comprehend the\nagreement of all the parts with the whole, and thus indeed to give us the\nclue to their investigation; but it must by no means on this account be\nmade the actual ground of explanation of the origin and existence of such\nbodies. For the necessity of so conceiving them is of subjective origin.\nSomewhat in this way I would epitomise Kant’s doctrine on this question.\nIn its most important aspect he had expounded it already in the “Critique\nof Pure Reason,” p. 692-702; V., 720-730. But in the knowledge of _this_\ntruth also we find David Hume to be Kant’s worthy forerunner. He also had\nkeenly controverted that assumption in the second part of his “Dialogues\nconcerning Natural Religion.” The difference between Hume’s criticism of\nthat assumption and Kant’s is principally this, that Hume criticised it as\nan assumption based upon experience, while Kant, on the other hand,\ncriticised it as an _a priori_ assumption. Both are right, and their\nexpositions supplement each other. Indeed what is really essential in the\nKantian doctrine on this point we find already expressed in the commentary\nof Simplicius on Aristotle’s Physics: “ἡ δε πλανη γεγονεν αυτοις απο του\nἡγεισθαι, παντα τα ἑνεκα του γινομενα κατα προαιρεσιν γενεσθαι και\nλογισμον, τα δε φυσει μη ὁυτως ὁραν γινομενα.” (_Error iis ortus est ex\neo, quod credebant, omnia, quæ propter finem aliquem fierent, ex proposito\net ratiocinio fieri, dum videbant, naturæ opera non ita fieri._) _Schol.\nin Arist., ex edit. Berol._, p. 354. Kant is perfectly right in the\nmatter; and it was necessary that after it had been shown that the\nconception of cause and effect is inapplicable to the whole of nature in\ngeneral, in respect of its existence, it should also be shown that in\nrespect of its qualities it is not to be thought of as the effect of a\ncause guided by motives (designs). If we consider the great plausibility\nof the physico-theological proof, which even Voltaire held to be\nirrefragable, it was clearly of the greatest importance to show that what\nis subjective in our comprehension, to which Kant had relegated space,\ntime, and causality, extends also to our judgment of natural bodies; and\naccordingly the compulsion which we feel to think of them as having arisen\nas the result of premeditation, according to designs, thus in such a way\nthat _the idea of them preceded their existence_, is just as much of\nsubjective origin as the perception of space, which presents itself so\nobjectively, and that therefore it must not be set up as objective truth.\nKant’s exposition of the matter, apart from its tedious prolixity and\nrepetitions, is excellent. He rightly asserts that we can never succeed in\nexplaining the nature of organised bodies from merely mechanical causes,\nby which he understands the undesigned and regular effect of all the\nuniversal forces of nature. Yet I find here another flaw. He denies the\npossibility of such an explanation merely with regard to the teleology and\napparent adaptation of _organised_ bodies. But we find that even where\nthere is no organisation the grounds of explanation which apply to _one_\nprovince of nature cannot be transferred to another, but forsake us as\nsoon as we enter a new province, and new fundamental laws appear instead\nof them, the explanation of which is by no means to be expected from the\nlaws of the former province. Thus in the province of the mechanical,\nproperly so called, the laws of gravitation, cohesion, rigidity, fluidity,\nand elasticity prevail, which in themselves (apart from my explanation of\nall natural forces as lower grades of the objectification of will) exist\nas manifestations of forces which cannot be further explained, but\nthemselves constitute the principles of all further explanation, which\nmerely consists in reduction to them. If we leave this province and come\nto the phenomena of chemistry, of electricity, magnetism, crystallisation,\nthe former principles are absolutely of no use, indeed the former laws are\nno longer valid, the former forces are overcome by others, and the\nphenomena take place in direct contradiction to them, according to new\nlaws, which, just like the former ones, are original and inexplicable,\n_i.e._, cannot be reduced to more general ones. Thus, for example, no one\nwill ever succeed in explaining even the dissolving of a salt in water in\naccordance with the laws proper to mechanics, much less the more\ncomplicated phenomena of chemistry. All this has already been explained at\nlength in the second book of the present work. An exposition of this kind\nwould, as it seems to me, have been of great use in the “Critique of the\nTeleological Judgment,” and would have thrown much light upon what is said\nthere. Such an exposition would have been especially favourable to his\nexcellent remark that a more profound knowledge of the real being, of\nwhich the things of nature are the manifestation, would recognise both in\nthe mechanical (according to law) and the apparently intentional effects\nof nature one and the same ultimate principle, which might serve as the\nmore general ground of explanation of them both. Such a principle I hope I\nhave given by establishing the will as the real thing in itself; and in\naccordance with it generally in the second book and the supplements to it,\nbut especially in my work “On the Will in Nature,” the insight into the\ninner nature of the apparent design and of the harmony and agreement of\nthe whole of nature has perhaps become clearer and deeper. Therefore I\nhave nothing more to say about it here.\n\nThe reader whom this criticism of the Kantian philosophy interests should\nnot neglect to read the supplement to it which is given in the second\nessay of the first volume of my “Parerga and Paralipomena,” under the\ntitle “_Noch einige Erläuterungen zur Kantischen Philosophie_” (Some\nFurther Explanations of the Kantian Philosophy). For it must be borne in\nmind that my writings, few as they are, were not composed all at once, but\nsuccessively, in the course of a long life, and with long intervals\nbetween them. Accordingly, it must not be expected that all I have said\nupon one subject should stand together in one place.\n\nSUPPLEMENTS TO THE FIRST BOOK.\n\n    “ ‘Warum willst du dich von uns Allen\n    Und unsrer Meinung entfernen?’\n    Ich schreibe nicht euch zu gefallen,\n    Ihr sollt was lernen.”\n\n    —GOETHE.\n\nFirst Half. The Doctrine Of The Idea Of Perception. (To § 1-7 of the First\nVolume.)\n\nChapter I. The Standpoint of Idealism.\n\nIn boundless space countless shining spheres, about each of which, and\nilluminated by its light, there revolve a dozen or so of smaller ones, hot\nat the core and covered with a hard, cold crust, upon whose surface there\nhave been generated from a mouldy film beings which live and know—this is\nwhat presents itself to us in experience as the truth, the real, the\nworld. Yet for a thinking being it is a precarious position to stand upon\none of those numberless spheres moving freely in boundless space without\nknowing whence or whither, and to be only one of innumerable similar\nbeings who throng and press and toil, ceaselessly and quickly arising and\npassing away in time, which has no beginning and no end; moreover, nothing\npermanent but matter alone and the recurrence of the same varied organised\nforms, by means of certain ways and channels which are there once for all.\nAll that empirical science can teach is only the more exact nature and law\nof these events. But now at last modern philosophy especially through\nBerkeley and Kant, has called to mind that all this is first of all merely\na _phenomenon of the brain_, and is affected with such great, so many, and\nsuch different _subjective_ conditions that its supposed absolute reality\nvanishes away, and leaves room for an entirely different scheme of the\nworld, which consists of what lies at the foundation of that phenomenon,\n_i.e._, what is related to it as the thing in itself is related to its\nmere manifestation.\n\n“The world is my idea” is, like the axioms of Euclid, a proposition which\nevery one must recognise as true as soon as he understands it; although it\nis not a proposition which every one understands as soon as he hears it.\nTo have brought this proposition to clear consciousness, and in it the\nproblem of the relation of the ideal and the real, _i.e._, of the world in\nthe head to the world outside the head, together with the problem of moral\nfreedom, is the distinctive feature of modern philosophy. For it was only\nafter men had spent their labour for thousands of years upon a mere\nphilosophy of the object that they discovered that among the many things\nthat make the world so obscure and doubtful the first and chiefest is\nthis, that however immeasurable and massive it may be, its existence yet\nhangs by a single thread; and this is the actual consciousness in which it\nexists. This condition, to which the existence of the world is irrevocably\nsubject, marks it, in spite of all _empirical_ reality, with the stamp of\n_ideality_, and therefore of mere _phenomenal appearance_. Thus on one\nside at least the world must be recognised as akin to dreams, and indeed\nto be classified along with them. For the same function of the brain\nwhich, during sleep, conjures up before us a completely objective,\nperceptible, and even palpable world must have just as large a share in\nthe presentation of the objective world of waking life. Both worlds,\nalthough different as regards their matter, are yet clearly moulded in the\none form. This form is the intellect, the function of the brain. Descartes\nwas probably the first who attained to the degree of reflection which this\nfundamental truth demands, and consequently he made it the starting-point\nof his philosophy, though provisionally only in the form of a sceptical\ndoubt. When he took his _cogito ergo sum_ as alone certain, and\nprovisionally regarded the existence of the world as problematical, he\nreally discovered the essential and only right starting-point of all\nphilosophy, and at the same time its _true_ foundation. This foundation is\nessentially and inevitably the _subjective_, the _individual\nconsciousness_. For this alone is and remains immediate; everything else,\nwhatever it may be, is mediated and conditioned through it, and is\ntherefore dependent upon it. Therefore modern philosophy is rightly\nregarded as starting with Descartes, who was the father of it. Not long\nafterwards Berkeley followed the same path further, and attained to\n_idealism_ proper, _i.e._, to the knowledge that the world which is\nextended in space, thus the objective, material world in general, exists\nas such simply and solely in our _idea_, and that it is false, and indeed\nabsurd, to attribute to it, _as such_, an existence apart from all idea\nand independent of the knowing subject, thus to assume matter as something\nabsolute and possessed of real being in itself. But his correct and\nprofound insight into this truth really constitutes Berkeley’s whole\nphilosophy; in it he had exhausted himself.\n\nThus true philosophy must always be idealistic; indeed, it must be so in\norder to be merely honest. For nothing is more certain than that no man\never came out of himself in order to identify himself directly with things\nwhich are different from him; but everything of which he has certain, and\ntherefore immediate, knowledge lies within his own consciousness. Beyond\nthis consciousness, therefore, there can be no _immediate_ certainty; but\nthe first principles of a science must have such certainty. For the\nempirical standpoint of the other sciences it is quite right to assume the\nobjective world as something absolutely given; but not so for the\nstandpoint of philosophy, which has to go back to what is first and\noriginal. Only consciousness is immediately given; therefore the basis of\nphilosophy is limited to facts of consciousness, _i.e._, it is essentially\n_idealistic_. Realism which commends itself to the crude understanding, by\nthe appearance which it assumes of being matter-of-fact, really starts\nfrom an arbitrary assumption, and is therefore an empty castle in the air,\nfor it ignores or denies the first of all facts, that all that we know\nlies within consciousness. For that the _objective existence_ of things is\nconditioned through a subject whose ideas they are, and consequently that\nthe objective world exists only as _idea_, is no hypothesis, and still\nless a dogma, or even a paradox set up for the sake of discussion; but it\nis the most certain and the simplest truth; and the knowledge of it is\nonly made difficult by the fact that it is indeed so simple, and that it\nis not every one who has sufficient power of reflection to go back to the\nfirst elements of his consciousness of things. There can never be an\nabsolute and independent objective existence; indeed such an existence is\nquite unintelligible. For the objective, as such, always and essentially\nhas its existence in the consciousness of a subject, is thus the idea of\nthis subject, and consequently is conditioned by it, and also by its\nforms, the forms of the idea, which depend upon the subject and not on the\nobject.\n\nThat _the objective world would exist_ even if there existed no conscious\nbeing certainly seems at the first blush to be unquestionable, because it\ncan be thought in the abstract, without bringing to light the\ncontradiction which it carries within it. But if we desire to _realise_\nthis abstract thought, that is, to reduce it to ideas of perception, from\nwhich alone (like everything abstract) it can have content and truth, and\nif accordingly we try _to imagine an objective world without a knowing\nsubject_, we become aware that what we then imagine is in truth the\nopposite of what we intended, is in fact nothing else than the process in\nthe intellect of a knowing subject who perceives an objective world, is\nthus exactly what we desired to exclude. For this perceptible and real\nworld is clearly a phenomenon of the brain; therefore there lies a\ncontradiction in the assumption that as such it ought also to exist\nindependently of all brains.\n\nThe principal objection to the inevitable and essential _ideality of all\nobjects_, the objection which, distinctly or indistinctly, arises in every\none, is certainly this: My own person also is an object for some one else,\nis thus his idea, and yet I know certainly that I would continue to exist\neven if he no longer perceived me. But all other objects also stand in the\nsame relation to his intellect as I do; consequently they also would\ncontinue to exist without being perceived by him. The answer to this is:\nThat other being as whose object I now regard my person is not absolutely\n_the subject_, but primarily is a knowing individual. Therefore, if he no\nlonger existed, nay, even if there existed no other conscious being except\nmyself, yet the subject, in whose idea alone all objects exist, would by\nno means be on that account abolished. For I myself indeed am this\nsubject, as every conscious being is. Consequently, in the case assumed,\nmy person would certainly continue to exist, but still as idea, in my own\nknowledge. For even by me myself it is always known only indirectly, never\nimmediately; because all existence as idea is indirect. As _object_,\n_i.e._, as extended, occupying space and acting, I know my body only in\nthe perception of my brain. This takes place by means of the senses, upon\ndata supplied by which the percipient understanding performs its function\nof passing from effect to cause, and thereby, in that the eye sees the\nbody or the hands touch it, it constructs that extended figure which\npresents itself in space as my body. By no means, however, is there\ndirectly given me, either in some general feeling of bodily existence or\nin inner self-consciousness, any extension, form, or activity, which would\nthen coincide with my nature itself, which accordingly, in order so to\nexist, would require no other being in whose knowledge it might exhibit\nitself. On the contrary, that general feeling of bodily existence, and\nalso self-consciousness, exists directly only in relation to the _will_,\nthat is, as agreeable or disagreeable, and as active in the acts of will,\nwhich for external perception exhibit themselves as actions of the body.\nFrom this it follows that the existence of my person or body as _something\nextended and acting_ always presupposes a _knowing being_ distinct from\nit; because it is essentially an existence in apprehension, in the idea,\nthus an existence _for another_. In fact, it is a phenomenon of brain,\njust as much whether the brain in which it exhibits itself is my own or\nbelongs to another person. In the first case one’s own person divides\nitself into the knowing and the known, into object and subject, which here\nas everywhere stand opposed to each other, inseparable and irreconcilable.\nIf, then, my own person, in order to exist as such, always requires a\nknowing subject, this will at least as much hold good of the other objects\nfor which it was the aim of the above objection to vindicate an existence\nindependent of knowledge and its subject.\n\nHowever, it is evident that the existence which is conditioned through a\nknowing subject is only the existence in space, and therefore that of an\nextended and active being. This alone is always something known, and\nconsequently _an existence for another_. On the other hand, every being\nthat exists in this way may yet have _an existence for itself_, for which\nit requires no subject. Yet this existence for itself cannot be extension\nand activity (together space-occupation), but is necessarily a being of\nanother kind, that of a thing in itself, which, as such, can never be an\n_object_. This, then, would be the answer to the leading objection set\nforth above, which accordingly does not overthrow the fundamental truth\nthat the objectively given world can only exist in the idea, thus only for\na subject.\n\nWe have further to remark here that Kant also, so long at least as he\nremained consistent, can have thought no _objects_ among his things in\nthemselves. For this follows from the fact that he proves that space, and\nalso time, are mere forms of our perception, which consequently do not\nbelong to things in themselves. What is neither in space nor in time can\nbe no _object_; thus the being of _things in themselves_ cannot be\nobjective, but of quite a different kind, a metaphysical being.\nConsequently that Kantian principle already involves this principle also,\nthat the _objective_ world exists only as _idea_.\n\nIn spite of all that one may say, nothing is so persistently and ever anew\nmisunderstood as _Idealism_, because it is interpreted as meaning that one\ndenies the _empirical_ reality of the external world. Upon this rests the\nperpetual return to the appeal to common sense, which appears in many\nforms and guises; for example, as an “irresistible conviction” in the\nScotch school, or as Jacobi’s _faith_ in the reality of the external\nworld. The external world by no means presents itself, as Jacobi declares,\nupon credit, and is accepted by us upon trust and faith. It presents\nitself as that which it is, and performs directly what it promises. It\nmust be remembered that Jacobi, who set up such a credit or faith theory\nof the world, and had the fortune to impose it upon a few professors of\nphilosophy, who for thirty years have philosophised upon the same lines\nlengthily and at their ease, is the same man who once denounced Lessing as\na Spinozist, and afterwards denounced Schelling as an atheist, and who\nreceived from the latter the well-known and well-deserved castigation. In\nkeeping with such zeal, when he reduced the external world to a mere\nmatter of faith he only wished to open the door to faith in general, and\nto prepare belief for that which was afterwards really to be made a matter\nof belief; as if, in order to introduce a paper currency, one should seek\nto appeal to the fact that the value of the ringing coin also depends\nmerely on the stamp which the State has set upon it. Jacobi, in his\ndoctrine that the reality of the external world is assumed upon faith, is\njust exactly “the transcendental realist who plays the empirical idealist”\ncensured by Kant in the “Critique of Pure Reason,” first edition, p. 369.\n\nThe true idealism, on the contrary, is not the empirical but the\ntranscendental. This leaves the empirical reality of the world untouched,\nbut holds fast to the fact that every _object_, thus the empirically real\nin general, is conditioned in a twofold manner by the subject; in the\nfirst place _materially_ or as _object_ generally, because an objective\nexistence is only conceivable as opposed to a subject, and as its idea; in\nthe second place _formally_, because the mode of existence of an object,\n_i.e._, its being perceived (space, time, causality), proceeds from the\nsubject, is pre-arranged in the subject. Therefore with the simple or\nBerkeleian idealism, which concerns the object in general, there stands in\nimmediate connection the Kantian idealism, which concerns the specially\ngiven _mode or manner_ of objective existence. This proves that the whole\nmaterial world, with its bodies, which are extended in space and, by means\nof time, have causal relations to each other, and everything that depends\nupon this—that all this is not something which is there _independently_ of\nour head, but essentially presupposes the functions of our brain _by means\nof which_ and _in_ which alone _such_ an objective arrangement of things\nis possible. For time, space, and causality, upon which all those real and\nobjective events rest, are themselves nothing more than functions of the\nbrain; so that thus the unchangeable _order_ of things which affords the\ncriterion and clue to their empirical reality itself proceeds only from\nthe brain, and has its credentials from this alone. All this Kant has\nexpounded fully and thoroughly; only he does not speak of the brain, but\ncalls it “the faculty of knowledge.” Indeed he has attempted to prove that\nwhen that objective order in time, space, causality, matter, &c., upon\nwhich all the events of the real world ultimately rest, is properly\nconsidered, it cannot even be conceived as a self-existing order, _i.e._,\nan order of the thing in itself, or as something absolutely objective and\nunconditionally given, for if one tries to think this out it leads to\ncontradictions. To accomplish this was the object of the antinomies, but\nin the appendix to my work I have proved the failure of the attempt. On\nthe other hand, the Kantian doctrine, even without the antinomies, leads\nto the insight that things and the whole mode of their existence are\ninseparably bound up with our consciousness of them. Therefore whoever has\ndistinctly grasped this soon attains to the conviction that the assumption\nthat things also exist as such, apart from and independently of our\nconsciousness, is really absurd. That we are so deeply involved in time,\nspace, causality, and the whole regular process of experience which rests\nupon them, that we (and indeed the brutes) are so perfectly at home, and\nknow how to find our way from the first—this would not be possible if our\nintellect were one thing and things another, but can only be explained\nfrom the fact that both constitute one whole, the intellect itself creates\nthat order, and exists only for things, while they, on the other hand,\nexist only for it.\n\nBut even apart from the deep insight, which only the Kantian philosophy\ngives, the inadmissibility of the assumption of absolute realism which is\nso obstinately clung to may be directly shown, or at least made capable of\nbeing felt, by the simple exhibition of its meaning in the light of such\nconsiderations as the following. According to realism, the world is\nsupposed to exist, as we know it, independently of this knowledge. Let us\nonce, then, remove all percipient beings from it, and leave only\nunorganised and vegetable nature. Rock, tree, and brook are there, and the\nblue heaven; sun, moon, and stars light this world, as before; yet\ncertainly in vain, for there is no eye to see it. Let us now in addition\nplace in it a percipient being. Now that world presents itself _again_ in\nhis brain, and repeats itself within it precisely as it was formerly\nwithout it. Thus to the _first_ world a _second_ has been added, which,\nalthough completely separated from it, resembles it to a nicety. And now\nthe _subjective_ world of this perception is precisely so constituted in\n_subjective_, known space as the _objective_ world in _objective_,\ninfinite space. But the subjective world has this advantage over the\nobjective, the knowledge that that space, outside there, is infinite;\nindeed it can also give beforehand most minutely and accurately the whole\nconstitution or necessary properties of all relations which are possible,\nthough not yet actual, in that space, and does not require to examine\nthem. It can tell just as much with regard to the course of time, and also\nwith regard to the relation of cause and effect which governs the changes\nin that external world. I think all this, when closely considered, turns\nout absurd enough, and hence leads to the conviction that that absolute\nobjective world outside the head, independent of it and prior to all\nknowledge, which at first we imagined ourselves to conceive, is really no\nother than the second, the world which is known _subjectively_, the world\nof idea, as which alone we are actually able to conceive it. Thus of its\nown accord the assumption forces itself upon us, that the world, as we\nknow it, exists also only for our knowledge, therefore in the _idea_\nalone, and not a second time outside of it.(12) In accordance, then, with\nthis assumption, the thing in itself, _i.e._, that which exists\nindependently of our knowledge and of every knowledge, is to be regarded\nas something completely different from the _idea_ and all its attributes,\nthus from objectivity in general. What this is will be the subject of our\nsecond book.\n\nOn the other hand, the controversy concerning the reality of the external\nworld considered in § 5 of the first volume rests upon the assumption,\nwhich has just been criticised, of an objective and a subjective world\nboth in _space_, and upon the impossibility which arises in connection\nwith this presupposition of a transition from one to the other, a bridge\nbetween the two. Upon this controversy I have still to add the following\nremarks.\n\nThe subjective and the objective do not constitute a continuous whole.\nThat of which we are immediately conscious is bounded by the skin, or\nrather by the extreme ends of the nerves which proceed from the cerebral\nsystem. Beyond this lies a world of which we have no knowledge except\nthrough pictures in our head. Now the question is, whether and how far\nthere is a world independent of us which corresponds to these pictures.\nThe relation between the two could only be brought about by means of the\nlaw of causality; for this law alone leads from what is given to something\nquite different from it. But this law itself has first of all to prove its\nvalidity. Now it must either be of _objective_ or of _subjective_ origin;\nbut in either case it lies upon one or the other side, and therefore\ncannot supply the bridge between them. If, as Locke and Hume assume, it is\n_a posteriori_, thus drawn from experience, it is of _objective_ origin,\nand belongs then itself to the external world which is in question.\nTherefore it cannot attest the reality of this world, for then, according\nto Locke’s method, causality would be proved from experience, and the\nreality of experience from causality. If, on the contrary, it is given _a\npriori_, as Kant has more correctly taught us, then it is of _subjective_\norigin, and in that case it is clear that with it we remain always in the\n_subjective_ sphere. For all that is actually given _empirically_ in\nperception is the occurrence of a sensation in the organ of sense; and the\nassumption that this, even in general, must have a cause rests upon a law\nwhich is rooted in the form of our knowledge, _i.e._, in the functions of\nour brain. The origin of this law is therefore just as subjective as that\nof the sensation itself. The cause of the given sensation, which is\nassumed in consequence of this law, presents itself at once in perception\nas an _object_, which has space and time for the form of its\nmanifestation. But _these forms_ themselves again are entirely of\nsubjective origin; for they are the mode or method of our faculty of\nperception. That transition from the sensation to its cause which, as I\nhave repeatedly pointed out, lies at the foundation of all\nsense-perception is certainly sufficient to give us the empirical presence\nin space and time of an empirical object, and is therefore quite enough\nfor the practical purposes of life; but it is by no means sufficient to\nafford us any conclusion as to the existence and real nature, or rather as\nto the intelligible substratum, of the phenomena which in this way arise\nfor us. Thus that on the occasion of certain sensations occurring in my\norgans of sense there arises in my head a perception of things which are\nextended in space, permanent in time, and causally efficient by no means\njustifies the assumption that they also exist in themselves, _i.e._, that\nsuch things with these properties belonging absolutely to themselves exist\nindependently and outside of my head. This is the true outcome of the\nKantian philosophy. It coincides with an earlier result of Locke’s, which\nis just as true, but far more easily understood. For although, as Locke’s\ndoctrine permits, external things are absolutely assumed as the causes of\nsensations, yet there can be no _resemblance_ between the sensation in\nwhich the _effect_ consists and the objective nature of the _cause_ which\noccasions it. For the sensation, as organic function, is primarily\ndetermined by the highly artificial and complicated nature of our organs\nof sense. It is therefore merely excited by the external cause, but is\nthen perfected entirely in accordance with its own laws, and thus is\ncompletely subjective. Locke’s philosophy was the criticism of the\nfunctions of sense; Kant has given us the criticism of the functions of\nthe brain. But to all this we have yet to add the Berkeleian result, which\nhas been revised by me, that every object, whatever its origin may be, is\n_as object_ already conditioned by the subject, is in fact merely its\n_idea_. The aim of realism is indeed the object without subject; but it is\nimpossible even to conceive such an object distinctly.\n\nFrom this whole inquiry it follows with certainty and distinctness that it\nis absolutely impossible to attain to the comprehension of the inner\nnature of things upon the path of mere _knowledge_ and _perception_. For\nknowledge always comes to things from without, and therefore must for ever\nremain outside them. This end would only be reached if we could find\n_ourselves_ in the inside of things, so that their inner nature would be\nknown to us directly. Now, how far this is actually the case is considered\nin my second book. But so long as we are concerned, as in this first book,\nwith objective comprehension, that is, with _knowledge_, the world is, and\nremains for us, a mere _idea_, for here there is no possible path by which\nwe can cross over to it.\n\nBut, besides this, a firm grasp of the point of view of _idealism_ is a\nnecessary counterpoise to that of _materialism_. The controversy\nconcerning the _real_ and the _ideal_ may also be regarded as a\ncontroversy concerning the existence of _matter_. For it is the reality or\nideality of this that is ultimately in question. Does matter, as such,\nexist only in our _idea_, or does it also exist independently of it? In\nthe latter case it would be the thing in itself; and whoever assumes a\nself-existent matter must also, consistently, be a materialist, _i.e._, he\nmust make matter the principle of explanation of all things. Whoever, on\nthe contrary, denies its existence as a thing in itself is _eo ipso_ an\nidealist. Among the moderns only Locke has definitely and without\nambiguity asserted the reality of matter; and therefore his teaching led,\nin the hands of Condillac, to the sensualism and materialism of the\nFrench. Only Berkeley directly and without modifications denies matter.\nThe complete antithesis is thus that of idealism and materialism,\nrepresented in its extremes by Berkeley and the French materialists\n(Hollbach). Fichte is not to be mentioned here: he deserves no place among\ntrue philosophers; among those elect of mankind who, with deep\nearnestness, seek not their own things but the _truth_, and therefore must\nnot be confused with those who, under this pretence, have only their\npersonal advancement in view. Fichte is the father of the _sham\nphilosophy_, of the _disingenuous_ method which, through ambiguity in the\nuse of words, incomprehensible language, and sophistry, seeks to deceive,\nand tries, moreover, to make a deep impression by assuming an air of\nimportance—in a word, the philosophy which seeks to bamboozle and humbug\nthose who desire to learn. After this method had been applied by\nSchelling, it reached its height, as every one knows, in Hegel, in whose\nhands it developed into pure charlatanism. But whoever even names this\nFichte seriously along with Kant shows that he has not even a dim notion\nof what Kant is. On the other hand, materialism also has its warrant. It\nis just as true that the knower is a product of matter as that matter is\nmerely the idea of the knower; but it is also just as one-sided. For\nmaterialism is the philosophy of the subject that forgets to take account\nof itself. And, accordingly, as against the assertion that I am a mere\nmodification of matter, this must be insisted upon, that all matter exists\nmerely in my idea; and it is no less right. A knowledge, as yet obscure,\nof these relations seems to have been the origin of the saying of Plato,\n“ὑλη αληθινον ψευδος” (_materia mendacium verax_).\n\n_Realism_ necessarily leads, as we have said, to _materialism_. For if\nempirical perception gives us things in themselves, as they exist\nindependently of our knowledge, experience also gives us the _order_ of\nthings in themselves, _i.e._, the true and sole order of the world. But\nthis path leads to the assumption that there is only _one_ thing in\nitself, matter; of which all other things are modifications; for the\ncourse of nature is here the absolute and only order of the world. To\nescape from these consequences, while realism remained in undisputed\nacceptance, spiritualism was set up, that is, the assumption of a second\nsubstance outside of and along with matter, an _immaterial substance_.\nThis dualism and spiritualism, equally unsupported by experience and\ndestitute of proof and comprehensibility, was denied by Spinoza, and was\nproved to be false by Kant, who dared to do so because at the same time he\nestablished idealism in its rights. For with realism materialism, as the\ncounterpoise of which spiritualism had been devised, falls to the ground\nof its own accord, because then matter and the course of nature become\nmere phenomena, which are conditioned by the intellect, as they have their\nexistence only in its _idea_. Accordingly spiritualism is the delusive and\nfalse safeguard against materialism, while the real and true safeguard is\nidealism, which, by making the objective world dependent upon us, gives\nthe needed counterpoise to the position of dependence upon the objective\nworld, in which we are placed by the course of nature. The world from\nwhich I part at death is, in another aspect, only my idea. The centre of\ngravity of existence falls back into the _subject_. What is proved is not,\nas in spiritualism, that the knower is independent of matter, but that all\nmatter is dependent on him. Certainly this is not so easy to comprehend or\nso convenient to handle as spiritualism, with its two substances; but\nχαλεπα τα καλα.\n\nIn opposition to the _subjective_ starting-point, “the world is my idea,”\nthere certainly stands provisionally with equal justification the\n_objective_ starting-point, “the world is matter,” or “matter alone is\nabsolute” (since it alone is not subject to becoming and passing away), or\n“all that exists is matter.” This is the starting-point of Democritus,\nLeucippus, and Epicurus. But, more closely considered, the departure from\nthe subject retains a real advantage; it has the start by one perfectly\njustified step. For consciousness alone is the _immediate_: but we pass\nover this if we go at once to matter and make it our starting-point. On\nthe other hand, it would certainly be possible to construct the world from\nmatter and its properties if these were correctly, completely, and\nexhaustively known to us (which is far from being the case as yet). For\nall that has come to be has become actual through _causes_, which could\noperate and come together only by virtue of the _fundamental forces of\nmatter_. But these must be perfectly capable of demonstration at least\nobjectively, even if subjectively we never attain to a knowledge of them.\nBut such an explanation and construction of the world would not only have\nat its foundation the assumption of an existence in itself of matter\n(while in truth it is conditioned by the subject), but it would also be\nobliged to allow all the _original qualities_ in this matter to pass\ncurrent and remain absolutely inexplicable, thus as _qualitates occultæ_.\n(Cf. § 26, 27 of the first volume.) For matter is only the vehicle of\nthese forces, just as the law of causality is only the arranger of their\nmanifestations. Therefore such an explanation of the world would always\nremain merely relative and conditioned, properly the work of a _physical\nscience_, which at every step longed for a _metaphysic_. On the other\nhand, there is also something inadequate about the subjective\nstarting-point and first principle, “the world is my idea,” partly because\nit is one-sided, since the world is far more than that (the thing in\nitself, will), and indeed its existence as idea is to a certain extent\nonly accidental to it; but partly also because it merely expresses the\nfact that the object is conditioned by the subject, without at the same\ntime saying that the subject, as such, is also conditioned by the object.\nFor the assertion, “the subject would still remain a knowing being if it\nhad no object, _i.e._, if it had absolutely no idea,” is just as false as\nthe assertion of the crude understanding, “the world, the object, would\nstill exist, even if there were no subject.” A consciousness without an\nobject is no consciousness. A thinking subject has conceptions for its\nobject; a subject of sense perception has objects with the qualities\ncorresponding to its organisation. If we rob the subject of all special\ncharacteristics and forms of its knowledge, all the properties of the\nobject vanish also, and nothing remains but _matter without form and\nquality_, which can just as little occur in experience as a subject\nwithout the forms of its knowledge, but which remains opposed to the naked\nsubject as such, as its reflex, which can only disappear along with it.\nAlthough materialism pretends to postulate nothing more than this\nmatter—for instance, atoms—yet it unconsciously adds to it not only the\nsubject, but also space, time, and causality, which depend upon special\nproperties of the subject.\n\nThe world as idea, the objective world, has thus, as it were, two poles;\nthe simple knowing subject without the forms of its knowledge, and crude\nmatter without form and quality. Both are completely unknowable; the\nsubject because it is that which knows, matter because without form and\nquality it cannot be perceived. Yet both are fundamental conditions of all\nempirical perception. Thus the knowing subject, merely as such, which is a\npresupposition of all experience, stands opposed as its pure counterpart\nto the crude, formless, and utterly dead (_i.e._, will-less) matter, which\nis given in no experience, but which all experience presupposes. This\nsubject is not in time, for time is only the more definite form of all its\nideas. The matter which stands over against it is, like it, eternal and\nimperishable, endures through all time, but is, properly speaking, not\nextended, for extension gives form, thus it has no spatial properties.\nEverything else is involved in a constant process of coming into being and\npassing away, while these two represent the unmoved poles of the world as\nidea. The permanence of matter may therefore be regarded as the reflex of\nthe timelessness of the pure subject, which is simply assumed as the\ncondition of all objects. Both belong to phenomena, not to the thing in\nitself, but they are the framework of the phenomenon. Both are arrived at\nonly by abstraction, and are not given immediately, pure and for\nthemselves.\n\nThe fundamental error of all systems is the failure to understand this\ntruth. _Intelligence and matter are correlates_, _i.e._, the one exists\nonly for the other, both stand and fall together, the one is only the\nreflex of the other. Indeed they are really _one and the same thing_\nregarded from two opposite points of view; and this one thing, I am here\nanticipating, is the manifestation of the will, or the thing in itself.\nConsequently both are secondary, and therefore the origin of the world is\nnot to be sought in either of the two. But because of their failure to\nunderstand this, all systems (with the exception perhaps of that of\nSpinoza) sought the origin of all things in one of these two. Some of\nthem, on the one hand, suppose an intelligence, νους, as the absolutely\nFirst and δημιουργος, and accordingly in this allow an idea of things and\nof the world to precede their actual existence; consequently they\ndistinguish the real world from the world of idea; which is false.\nTherefore matter now appears as that through which the two are\ndistinguished, as the thing in itself. Hence arises the difficulty of\nprocuring this matter, the ὑλη, so that when added to the mere idea of the\nworld it may impart reality to it. That original intelligence must now\neither find it ready to hand, in which case it is just as much an absolute\nFirst as that intelligence itself, and we have then two absolute Firsts,\nthe δημιουργος and the ὑλη; or the absolute intelligence must create this\nmatter out of nothing, an assumption which our understanding refuses to\nmake, for it is only capable of comprehending changes in matter, and not\nthat matter itself should come into being or pass away. This rests\nultimately upon the fact that matter is essential, the correlate of the\nunderstanding. On the other hand, the systems opposed to these, which make\nthe other of the two correlates, that is, matter, the absolute First,\nsuppose a matter which would exist without being perceived; and it has\nbeen made sufficiently clear by all that has been said above that this is\na direct contradiction, for by the existence of matter we always mean\nsimply its being perceived. But here they encounter the difficulty of\nbringing to this matter, which alone is their absolute First, the\nintelligence which is finally to experience it. I have shown this weak\nside of materialism in § 7 of the first volume. For me, on the contrary,\nmatter and intelligence are inseparable correlates, which exist only for\neach other, and therefore merely relatively. Matter is the idea of the\nintelligence; the intelligence is that in whose idea alone matter exists.\nThe two together constitute _the world as idea_, which is just Kant’s\n_phenomenon_, and consequently something secondary. What is primary is\nthat which manifests itself, _the thing in itself_, which we shall\nafterwards discover is the will. This is in itself neither the perceiver\nnor the perceived, but is entirely different from the mode of its\nmanifestation.\n\nAs a forcible conclusion of this important and difficult discussion I\nshall now personify these two abstractions, and present them in a dialogue\nafter the fashion of Prabodha Tschandro Daya. It may also be compared with\na similar dialogue between matter and form in the “_Duodecim Principia\nPhilosophiæ_” of Raymund Lully, c. 1 and 2.\n\n_The Subject._\n\nI am, and besides me there is nothing. For the world is my idea.\n\n_Matter._\n\nPresumptuous delusion! I, I am, and besides me there is nothing, for the\nworld is my fleeting form. Thou art a mere result of a part of this form\nand altogether accidental.\n\n_The Subject._\n\nWhat insane arrogance! Neither thou nor thy form would exist without me;\nye are conditioned by me. Whosoever thinks me away, and believes he can\nstill think ye there, is involved in gross delusion, for your existence\napart from my idea is a direct contradiction, a meaningless form of words.\n_Ye are_ simply means ye are perceived by me. My idea is the sphere of\nyour existence; therefore I am its first condition.\n\n_Matter._\n\nFortunately the audacity of your assertion will soon be put to silence in\nreality and not by mere words. Yet a few moments and thou actually art no\nmore. With all thy boasting thou hast sunk into nothing, vanished like a\nshadow, and shared the fate of all my transitory forms. But I, I remain,\nunscathed and undiminished, from age to age, through infinite time, and\nbehold unshaken the play of my changing form.\n\n_The Subject._\n\nThis infinite time through which thou boastest that thou livest, like the\ninfinite space which thou fillest, exists only in my idea. Indeed it is\nmerely the form of my idea which I bear complete in myself, and in which\nthou exhibitest thyself, which receives thee, and through which thou first\nof all existest. But the annihilation with which thou threatenest me\ntouches me not; were it so, then wouldst thou also be annihilated. It\nmerely affects the individual, which for a short time is my vehicle, and\nwhich, like everything else, is my idea.\n\n_Matter._\n\nAnd if I concede this, and go so far as to regard thy existence, which is\nyet inseparably linked to that of these fleeting individuals, as something\nabsolute, it yet remains dependent upon mine. For thou art subject only so\nfar as thou hast an object; and this object I am. I am its kernel and\ncontent, that which is permanent in it, that which holds it together, and\nwithout which it would be as disconnected, as wavering, and unsubstantial\nas the dreams and fancies of thy individuals, which have yet borrowed from\nme even the illusive content they possess.\n\n_The Subject._\n\nThou dost well to refrain from contesting my existence on the ground that\nit is linked to individuals; for, as inseparably as I am joined to them,\nthou art joined to thy sister, Form, and hast never appeared without her.\nNo eye hath yet seen either thee or me naked and isolated; for we are both\nmere abstractions. It is in reality _one_ being that perceives itself and\nis perceived by itself, but whose real being cannot consist either in\nperceiving or in being perceived, since these are divided between us two.\n\n_Both._\n\nWe are, then, inseparably joined together as necessary parts of one whole,\nwhich includes us both and exists through us. Only a misunderstanding can\noppose us two hostilely to each other, and hence draw the false conclusion\nthat the one contests the existence of the other, with which its own\nexistence stands or falls.\n\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\n\nThis whole, which comprehends both, is the world as idea, or the world of\nphenomena. When this is taken away there remains only what is purely\nmetaphysical, the thing in itself, which in the second book we shall\nrecognise as the will.\n\nChapter II. The Doctrine of Perception or Knowledge Of The Understanding.\n\nWith all _transcendental_ ideality the objective world retains _empirical_\nreality; the object is indeed not the thing in itself, but as an empirical\nobject it is real. It is true that space is only in my head; but\nempirically my head is in space. The law of causality can certainly never\nenable us to get quit of idealism by building a bridge between things in\nthemselves and our knowledge of them, and thus certifying the absolute\nreality of the world, which exhibits itself in consequence of its\napplication; but this by no means does away with the causal relation of\nobjects to each other, thus it does not abolish the causal relation which\nunquestionably exists between the body of each knowing person and all\nother material objects. But the law of causality binds together only\nphenomena, and does not lead beyond them. With that law we are and remain\nin the world of objects, _i.e._, the world of phenomena, or more properly\nthe world of ideas. Yet the whole of such a world of experience is\nprimarily conditioned by the knowledge of a subject in general as its\nnecessary presupposition, and then by the special forms of our perception\nand apprehension, thus necessarily belongs to the merely _phenomenal_, and\nhas no claim to pass for the world of things in themselves. Indeed the\nsubject itself (so far as it is merely the _knowing_ subject) belongs to\nthe merely phenomenal, of which it constitutes the complementary half.\n\nWithout application of the law of causality, however, perception of an\n_objective_ world could never be arrived at; for this perception is, as I\nhave often explained, essentially matter of the _intellect_, and not\nmerely of the _senses_. The senses afford us mere _sensation_, which is\nfar from being _perception_. The part played by sensations of the senses\nin perception was distinguished by Locke under the name _secondary\nqualities_, which he rightly refused to ascribe to things in themselves.\nBut Kant, carrying Locke’s method further, distinguished also, and refused\nto ascribe to things in themselves what belongs to the working up of this\nmaterial (the sensations) by the brain. The result was, that in this was\nincluded all that Locke had left to things in themselves as _primary_\nqualities—extension, form, solidity, &c.—so that with Kant the thing in\nitself was reduced to a completely unknown quantity = _x_. With Locke\naccordingly the thing in itself is certainly without colour, sound, smell,\ntaste, neither warm nor cold, neither soft nor hard, neither smooth nor\nrough; yet it has still extension and form, it is impenetrable, at rest or\nin motion, and has mass and number. With Kant, on the other hand, it has\nlaid aside all these latter qualities also, because they are only possible\nby means of time, space, and causality, and these spring from an intellect\n(brain), just as colours, tones, smells, &c., originate in the nerves of\nthe organs of sense. The thing in itself has with Kant become spaceless,\nunextended, and incorporeal. Thus what the mere senses bring to the\nperception, in which the objective world exists, stands to what is\nsupplied by the _functions of the brain_ (space, time, causality) as the\nmass of the nerves of sense stand to the mass of the brain, after\nsubtracting that part of the latter which is further applied to thinking\nproper, _i.e._, to abstract ideas, and is therefore not possessed by the\nbrutes. For as the nerves of the organs of sense impart to the phenomenal\nobjects colour, sound, taste, smell, temperature, &c., so the brain\nimparts to them extension, form, impenetrability, the power of movement,\n&c., in short all that can only be presented in perception by means of\ntime, space, and causality. How small is the share of the senses in\nperception, compared with that of the intellect, is also shown by a\ncomparison of the nerve apparatus for receiving impressions with that for\nworking them up. The mass of the nerves of sensation of the whole of the\norgans of sense is very small compared with that of the brain, even in the\ncase of the brutes, whose brain, since they do not, properly speaking,\n_i.e._, in the abstract, think, is merely used for effecting perception,\nand yet when this is complete, thus in the case of mammals, has a very\nconsiderable mass, even after the cerebellum, whose function is the\nsystematic guidance of movements, has been taken away.\n\nThat excellent book by Thomas Reid, the “Inquiry into the Human Mind”\n(first edition, 1764; 6th edition, 1810), as a _negative_ proof of the\nKantian truths, affords us a very thorough conviction of the inadequacy of\nthe senses to produce the objective perception of things, and also of the\nnon-empirical origin of the perception of space and time. Reid refutes\nLocke’s doctrine that perception is a product of the senses, by a thorough\nand acute demonstration that the collective sensations of the senses do\nnot bear the least resemblance to the world as known in perception, and\nespecially that the five primary qualities of Locke (extension, form,\nsolidity, movement, and number) absolutely could not be afforded us by any\nsensation of the senses. Accordingly he gives up the question as to the\nmode of origination and the source of perception as completely insoluble;\nand although altogether unacquainted with Kant, he gives us, as it were,\naccording to the _regula falsi_, a thorough proof of the intellectual\nnature of perception (really first explained by me as a consequence of the\nKantian doctrine), and also of the _a priori_ source, discovered by Kant,\nof its constituent elements, space, time, and causality, from which those\nprimary qualities of Locke first proceed, but by means of which they are\neasily constructed. Thomas Reid’s book is very instructive and well worth\nreading—ten times more so than all the philosophy together that has been\nwritten since Kant. Another indirect proof of the same doctrine, though in\nthe way of error, is afforded by the French sensational philosophers, who,\nsince Condillac trod in the footsteps of Locke, have laboured to show once\nfor all that the whole of our perception and thinking can be referred to\nmere sensations (_penser c’est sentir_), which, after Locke’s example,\nthey call _idées simples_, and through the mere coming together and\ncomparison of which the whole objective world is supposed to build itself\nup in our heads. These gentlemen certainly have _des idées bien simples_.\nIt is amusing to see how, lacking alike the profundity of the German and\nthe honesty of the English philosopher, they turn the poor material of\nsensation this way and that way, and try to increase its importance, in\norder to construct out of it the deeply significant phenomena of the world\nof perception and thought. But the man constructed by them would\nnecessarily be an _Anencephalus_, a _Tête de crapaud_, with only organs of\nsense and without a brain. To take only a couple of the better attempts of\nthis sort out of a multitude of others, I may mention as examples\nCondorcet at the beginning of his book, “_Des Progrès de l’Esprit\nHumain_,” and Tourtual on Sight, in the second volume of the\n_“__Scriptures Ophthalmologici Minores,__”__ edidit Justus Radius_ (1828).\n\nThe feeling of the insufficiency of a purely sensationalistic explanation\nof perception is in like manner shown in the assertion which was made\nshortly before the appearance of the Kantian philosophy, that we not only\nhave _ideas_ of things called forth by sensation, but apprehend the\n_things themselves_ directly, although they lie outside us—which is\ncertainly inconceivable. And this was not meant in some idealistic sense,\nbut was said from the point of view of common realism. This assertion is\nwell and pointedly put by the celebrated Euler in his “Letters to a German\nPrincess,” vol. ii. p. 68. He says: “I therefore believe that the\nsensations (of the senses) contain something more than philosophers\nimagine. They are not merely empty perceptions of certain impressions made\nin the brain. They do not give the soul mere _ideas_ of things, _but\nactually place before it objects_ which exist outside it, although we\ncannot conceive how this really happens.” This opinion is explained by the\nfollowing facts. Although, as I have fully proved, perception is brought\nabout by application of the law of causality, of which we are conscious _a\npriori_, yet in sight the act of the understanding, by means of which we\npass from the effect to the cause, by no means appears distinctly in\nconsciousness; and therefore the sensation does not separate itself\nclearly from the idea which is constructed out of it, as the raw material,\nby the understanding. Still less can a distinction between object and\nidea, which in general does not exist, appear in consciousness; but we\nfeel the _things themselves_ quite directly, and indeed as lying _outside\nus_, although it is certain that what is immediate can only be the\nsensation, and this is confined to the sphere of the body enclosed by our\nskin. This can be explained from the fact that _outside us_ is exclusively\na _spatial_ determination. But space itself is a form of our faculty of\nperception, _i.e._, a function of our brain. Therefore that externality to\nus to which we refer objects, on the occasion of sensations of sight, is\nitself really within our heads; for that is its whole sphere of activity.\nMuch as in the theatre we see the mountains, the woods, and the sea, but\nyet everything is inside the house. From this it becomes intelligible that\nwe perceive things in the relation of externality, and yet in every\nrespect immediately, but have not within us an idea of the things which\nlie outside us, different from these things. For things are in space, and\nconsequently also external to us only in so far as we _perceive_ them.\nTherefore those things which to this extent we perceive directly, and not\nmere images of them, are themselves only _our ideas_, and as such exist\nonly in our heads. Therefore we do not, as Euler says, directly perceive\nthe things themselves which are external to us, but rather the things\nwhich are perceived by us as external to us are only our ideas, and\nconsequently are apprehended by us immediately. The whole observation\ngiven above in Euler’s words, and which is quite correct, affords a fresh\nproof of Kant’s Transcendental Æsthetic, and of my theory of perception\nwhich is founded upon it, as also of idealism in general. The directness\nand unconsciousness referred to above, with which in perception we make\n_the transition from the sensation to its cause_, may be illustrated by an\nanalogous procedure in the use of abstract ideas or thinking. When we read\nor hear we receive mere words, but we pass from these so immediately to\nthe conceptions denoted by them, that it is as if we _received the\nconceptions directly_; for we are absolutely unconscious of the transition\nfrom the words to the conceptions. Therefore it sometimes happens that we\ndo not know in what language it was that we read something yesterday which\nwe now remember. Yet that such a transition always takes place becomes\napparent if it is once omitted, that is, if in a fit of abstraction we\nread without thinking, and then become aware that we certainly have taken\nin all the words but no conceptions. Only when we pass from abstract\nconceptions to pictures of the imagination do we become conscious of the\ntransposition we have made.\n\nFurther, it is really only in perception in the narrowest sense, that is,\nin _sight_, that in empirical apprehension the transition from the\nsensation to its cause takes place quite unconsciously. In every other\nkind of sense perception, on the contrary, the transition takes place with\nmore or less distinct consciousness; therefore, in the case of\napprehension through the four coarser senses, its reality is capable of\nbeing established as an immediate fact. Thus in the dark we feel a thing\nfor a long time on all sides until from the different effects upon our\nhands we are able to construct its definite form as their cause. Further,\nif something feels smooth we sometimes reflect whether we may not have fat\nor oil upon our hands; and again, if something feels cold we ask ourselves\nwhether it may not be that we have very warm hands. When we hear a sound\nwe sometimes doubt whether it was really an affection of our sense of\nhearing from without or merely an inner affection of it; then whether it\nsounded near and weak or far off and strong, then from what direction it\ncame, and finally whether it was the voice of a man or of a brute, or the\nsound of an instrument; thus we investigate the cause of each effect we\nexperience. In the case of smell and taste uncertainty as to the objective\nnature of the cause of the effect felt is of the commonest occurrence, so\ndistinctly are the two separated here. The fact that _in sight_ the\ntransition from the effect to the cause occurs quite unconsciously, and\nhence the illusion arises that this kind of perception is perfectly\ndirect, and consists simply in the sensation alone without any operation\nof the understanding—this has its explanation partly in the great\nperfection of the organ of vision, and partly in the exclusively\nrectilineal action of light. On account of the latter circumstance the\nimpression itself leads directly to the place of the cause, and since the\neye is capable of perceiving with the greatest exactness and at a glance\nall the fine distinctions of light and shade, colour and outline, and also\nthe data in accordance with which the understanding estimates distance, it\nthus happens that in the case of impressions of this sense the operation\nof the understanding takes place with such rapidity and certainty that we\nare just as little conscious of it as of spelling when we read. Hence\narises the delusion that the sensation itself presents us directly with\nthe objects. Yet it is just in sight that the operation of the\n_understanding_, consisting in the knowledge of the cause from the effect,\nis most significant. By means of it what is felt doubly, with two eyes, is\nperceived as single; by means of it the impression which strikes the\nretina upside down, in consequence of the crossing of the rays in the\npupils, is put right by following back the cause of this in the same\ndirection, or as we express ourselves, we see things upright although\ntheir image in the eye is reversed; and finally by means of the operation\nof the understanding magnitude and distance are estimated by us in direct\nperception from five different data, which are very clearly and\nbeautifully described by Dr. Thomas Reid. I expounded all this, and also\nthe proofs which irrefutably establish the _intellectual nature of\nperception_, as long ago as 1816, in my essay “On Sight and Colour”\n(second edition, 1854; third edition, 1870), and with important additions\nfifteen years later in the revised Latin version of it which is given\nunder the title, “_Theoria Colorum Physiologica Eademque Primaria_,” in\nthe third volume of the “_Scriptores Ophthalmologici Minores_,” published\nby Justus Radius in 1830; yet most fully and thoroughly in the second (and\nthird) edition of my essay “On the Principle of Sufficient Reason,”",

    "page_content": "Therefore on this important subject I refer to these works, so as not to\nextend unduly the present exposition.\n\nOn the other hand, an observation which trenches on the province of\næsthetics may find its place here. It follows from the proved intellectual\nnature of perception that the sight of beautiful objects—for example, of a\nbeautiful view—is also a _phenomenon of the brain_. Its purity and\ncompleteness, therefore, depends not merely on the object, but also upon\nthe quality of the brain, its form and size, the fineness of its texture,\nand the stimulation of its activity by the strength of the pulse of the\narteries which supply it. Accordingly the same view appears in different\nheads, even when the eyes are equally acute, as different as, for example,\nthe first and last impressions of a copper plate that has been much used.\nThis is the explanation of the difference of capacity for enjoying natural\nbeauty, and consequently also for reproducing it, _i.e._, for occasioning\na similar phenomenon of the brain by means of an entirely different kind\nof cause, the arrangement of colours on a canvas.\n\nThe apparent immediacy of perception, depending on its entire\nintellectuality, by virtue of which, as Euler says, we apprehend the thing\nitself, and as external to us, finds an analogy in the way in which we\nfeel the parts of our own bodies, especially when they suffer pain, which\nwhen we do feel them is generally the case. Just as we imagine that we\nperceive things where they are, while the perception really takes place in\nthe brain, we believe that we feel the pain of a limb in the limb itself,\nwhile in reality it also is felt in the brain, to which it is conducted by\nthe nerve of the affected part. Therefore, only the affections of those\nparts whose nerves go to the brain are felt, and not those of the parts\nwhose nerves belong to the sympathetic system, unless it be that an\nunusually strong affection of these parts penetrates by some roundabout\nway to the brain, where yet for the most part it only makes itself known\nas a dull sense of discomfort, and always without definite determination\nof its locality. Hence, also, it is that we do not feel injuries to a limb\nwhose nerve-trunk has been severed or ligatured. And hence, finally, the\nman who has lost a limb still sometimes feels pain in it, because the\nnerves which go to the brain are still there. Thus, in the two phenomena\nhere compared, what goes on in the brain is apprehended as outside of it;\nin the case of perception, by means of the understanding, which extends\nits feelers into the outer world; in the case of the feeling of our limbs,\nby means of the nerves.\n\nChapter III. On The Senses.\n\nIt is not the object of my writings to repeat what has been said by\nothers, and therefore I only make here some special remarks of my own on\nthe subject of the senses.\n\nThe senses are merely the channels through which the brain receives from\nwithout (in the form of sensations) the materials which it works up into\nideas of perception. Those sensations which principally serve for the\nobjective comprehension of the external world must in themselves be\nneither agreeable nor disagreeable. This really means that they must leave\nthe will entirely unaffected. Otherwise the sensation _itself_ would\nattract our attention, and we would remain at the _effect_ instead of\npassing to the _cause_, which is what is aimed at here. For it would bring\nwith it that marked superiority, as regards our consideration, which the\nwill always has over the mere idea, to which we only turn when the will is\nsilent. Therefore colours and sounds are in themselves, and so long as\ntheir impression does not pass the normal degree, neither painful nor\npleasurable sensations, but appear with the indifference that fits them to\nbe the material of pure objective perception. This is as far the case as\nwas possible in a body which is in itself through and through will; and\njust in this respect it is worthy of admiration. Physiologically it rests\nupon the fact that in the organs of the nobler senses, thus in sight and\nhearing, the nerves which have to receive the specific outward impression\nare quite insusceptible to any sensation of pain, and know no other\nsensation than that which is specifically peculiar to them, and which\nserves the purpose of mere apprehension. Thus the retina, as also the\noptic nerve, is insensible to every injury; and this is also the case with\nthe nerve of hearing. In both organs pain is only felt in their other\nparts, the surroundings of the nerve of sense which is peculiar to them,\nnever in this nerve itself. In the case of the eye such pain is felt\nprincipally in the _conjunctiva_; in the case of the ear, in the _meatus\nauditorius_. Even with the brain this is the case, for if it is cut into\ndirectly, thus from above, it has no feeling. Thus only on account of this\nindifference with regard to the will which is peculiar to them are the\nsensations of the eye capable of supplying the understanding with such\nmultifarious and finely distinguished data, out of which it constructs in\nour head the marvellous objective world, by the application of the law of\ncausality upon the foundation of the pure perceptions of space and time.\nJust that freedom from affecting the will which is characteristic of\nsensations of colour enables them, when their energy is heightened by\ntransparency, as in the glow of an evening sky, in painted glass, and the\nlike, to raise us very easily into the state of pure objective will-less\nperception, which, as I have shown in my third book, is one of the chief\nconstituent elements of the æsthetic impression. Just this indifference\nwith regard to the will fits sounds to supply the material for denoting\nthe infinite multiplicity of the conceptions of the reason.\n\n_Outer sense_, that is, receptivity for external impressions as pure data\nfor the understanding, is divided into _five senses_, and these\naccommodate themselves to the four elements, _i.e._, the four states of\naggregation, together with that of imponderability. Thus the sense for\nwhat is firm (earth) is touch; for what is fluid (water), taste; for what\nis in the form of vapour, _i.e._, volatile (vapour, exhalation), smell;\nfor what is permanently elastic (air), hearing; for what is imponderable\n(fire, light), sight. The second imponderable, heat, is not properly an\nobject of the senses, but of general feeling, and therefore always affects\nthe _will_ directly, as agreeable or disagreeable. From this\nclassification there also follows the relative dignity of the senses.\nSight has the highest rank, because its sphere is the widest and its\nsusceptibility the finest. This rests upon the fact that what affects it\nis an imponderable, that is, something which is scarcely corporeal, but is\n_quasi_ spiritual. Hearing has the second place, corresponding to air.\nHowever, touch is a more thorough and well-informed sense. For while each\nof the other senses gives us only an entirely one-sided relation to the\nobject, as its sound, or its relation to light, touch, which is closely\nbound up with general feeling and muscular power, supplies the\nunderstanding with the data at once for the form, magnitude, hardness,\nsoftness, texture, firmness, temperature, and weight of bodies, and all\nthis with the least possibility of illusion and deception, to which all\nthe other senses are far more subject. The two lowest senses, smell and\ntaste, are no longer free from a direct affection of the will, that is,\nthey are always agreeably or disagreeably affected, and are therefore more\nsubjective than objective.\n\nSensations of hearing are exclusively in _time_, and therefore the whole\nnature of music consists in degrees of time, upon which depends both the\nquality or pitch of tones, by means of vibrations, and also their quantity\nor duration, by means of time. The sensations of sight, on the other hand,\nare primarily and principally in _space_; but secondarily, by reason of\ntheir duration, they are also in time.\n\nSight is the sense of the understanding which perceives; hearing is the\nsense of the reason which thinks and apprehends. Words are only\nimperfectly represented by visible signs; and therefore I doubt whether a\ndeaf and dumb man, who can read, but has no idea of the sound of the\nwords, works as quickly in thinking with the mere visible signs of\nconceptions as we do with the real, _i.e._, the audible words. If he\ncannot read, it is well known that he is almost like an irrational animal,\nwhile the man born blind is from the first a thoroughly rational being.\n\nSight is an _active_, hearing a _passive_ sense. Therefore sounds affect\nour mind in a disturbing and hostile manner, and indeed they do so the\nmore in proportion as the mind is active and developed; they distract all\nthoughts and instantly destroy the power of thinking. On the other hand,\nthere is no analogous disturbance through the eye, no direct effect of\nwhat is seen, _as such_, upon the activity of thought (for naturally we\nare not speaking here of the influence which the objects looked at have\nupon the will); but the most varied multitude of things before our eyes\nadmits of entirely unhindered and quiet thought. Therefore the thinking\nmind lives at peace with the eye, but is always at war with the ear. This\nopposition of the two senses is also confirmed by the fact that if deaf\nand dumb persons are cured by galvanism they become deadly pale with\nterror at the first sounds they hear (Gilbert’s “_Annalen der Physik_,”\nvol. x. p. 382), while blind persons, on the contrary, who have been\noperated upon, behold with ecstasy the first light, and unwillingly allow\nthe bandages to be put over their eyes again. All that has been said,\nhowever, can be explained from the fact that hearing takes place by means\nof a mechanical vibration of the nerve of hearing which is at once\ntransmitted to the brain, while seeing, on the other hand, is a real\n_action_ of the retina which is merely stimulated and called forth by\nlight and its modifications; as I have shown at length in my physiological\ntheory of colours. But this whole opposition stands in direct conflict\nwith that coloured-ether, drum-beating theory which is now everywhere\nunblushingly served up, and which seeks to degrade the eye’s sensation of\nlight to a mechanical vibration, such as primarily that of hearing\nactually is, while nothing can be more different than the still, gentle\neffect of light and the alarm-drum of hearing. If we add to this the\nremarkable circumstance that although we hear with two ears, the\nsensibility of which is often very different, yet we never hear a sound\ndouble, as we often see things double with our two eyes, we are led to the\nconjecture that the sensation of hearing does not arise in the labyrinth\nor in the cochlea, but deep in the brain where the two nerves of hearing\nmeet, and thus the impression becomes simple. But this is where the _pons\nVarolii_ encloses the _medulla oblongata_, thus at the absolutely lethal\nspot, by the injury of which every animal is instantly killed, and from\nwhich the nerve of hearing has only a short course to the labyrinth, the\nseat of acoustic vibration. Now it is just because its source is here, in\nthis dangerous place, in which also all movement of the limbs originates,\nthat we start at a sudden noise; which does not occur in the least degree\nwhen we suddenly see a light; for example, a flash of lightning. The optic\nnerve, on the contrary, proceeds from its _thalami_ much further forward\n(though perhaps its source lies behind them), and throughout its course is\ncovered by the anterior lobes of the brain, although always separated from\nthem till, having extended quite out of the brain, it is spread out in the\nretina, upon which, on stimulation by light, the sensation first arises,\nand where it is really localised. This is shown in my essay upon sight and\ncolour. This origin of the auditory nerve explains, then, the great\ndisturbance which the power of thinking suffers from sound, on account of\nwhich thinking men, and in general all people of much intellect, are\nwithout exception absolutely incapable of enduring any noise. For it\ndisturbs the constant stream of their thoughts, interrupts and paralyses\ntheir thinking, just because the vibration of the auditory nerve extends\nso deep into the brain, the whole mass of which feels the oscillations set\nup through this nerve, and vibrates along with them, and because the\nbrains of such persons are more easily moved than those of ordinary men.\nOn the same readiness to be set in motion, and capacity for transmission,\nwhich characterises their brains depends the fact that in the case of\npersons like these every thought calls forth so readily all those\nanalogous or related to it whereby the similarities, analogies, and\nrelations of things in general come so quickly and easily into their\nminds; that the same occasion which millions of ordinary minds have\nexperienced before brings them to _the_ thought, to _the_ discovery, that\nother people are subsequently surprised they did not reach themselves, for\nthey certainly can think afterwards, but they cannot think before. Thus\nthe sun shone on all statues, but only the statue of Memnon gave forth a\nsound. For this reason Kant, Gœthe, and Jean Paul were highly sensitive to\nevery noise, as their biographers bear witness.(13) Gœthe in his last\nyears bought a house which had fallen into disrepair close to his own,\nsimply in order that he might not have to endure the noise that would be\nmade in repairing it. Thus it was in vain that in his youth he followed\nthe drum in order to harden himself against noise. It is not a matter of\ncustom. On the other hand, the truly stoical indifference to noise of\nordinary minds is astonishing. No noise disturbs them in their thinking,\nreading, writing, or other occupations, while the finer mind is rendered\nquite incapable by it. But just that which makes them so insensible to\nnoise of every kind makes them also insensible to the beautiful in plastic\nart, and to deep thought or fine expression in literary art; in short, to\nall that does not touch their personal interests. The following remark of\nLichtenberg’s applies to the paralysing effect which noise has upon highly\nintellectual persons: “It is always a good sign when an artist can be\nhindered by trifles from exercising his art. F—— used to stick his fingers\ninto sulphur if he wished to play the piano.... Such things do not\ninterfere with the average mind;... it acts like a coarse sieve”\n(_Vermischte Schriften_, vol. i. p. 398). I have long really held the\nopinion that the amount of noise which any one can bear undisturbed stands\nin inverse proportion to his mental capacity, and therefore may be\nregarded as a pretty fair measure of it. Therefore, if I hear the dogs\nbarking for hours together in the court of a house without being stopped,\nI know what to think of the intellectual capacity of the inhabitants. The\nman who habitually slams the door of a room, instead of shutting it with\nhis hand, or allows this to go on in his house, is not only ill-bred, but\nis also a coarse and dull-minded fellow. That in English “sensible” also\nmeans gifted with understanding is based upon accurate and fine\nobservation. We shall only become quite civilised when the ears are no\nlonger unprotected, and when it shall no longer be the right of everybody\nto sever the consciousness of each thinking being, in its course of a\nthousand steps, with whistling, howling, bellowing, hammering,\nwhip-cracking, barking, &c. &c. The Sybarites banished all noisy trades\nwithout the town; the honourable sect of the Shakers in North America\npermit no unnecessary noise in their villages, and the Moravians have a\nsimilar rule. Something more is said upon this subject in the thirtieth\nchapter of the second volume of the “Parerga.”\n\nThe effect of music upon the mind, so penetrating, so direct, so\nunfailing, may be explained from the _passive_ nature of hearing which has\nbeen discussed; also the after effect which sometimes follows it, and\nwhich consists in a specially elevated frame of mind. The vibrations of\nthe tones following in rationally combined numerical relations set the\nfibre of the brain itself in similar vibration. On the other hand, the\n_active_ nature of sight, opposed as it is to the passive nature of\nhearing, makes it intelligible why there can be nothing analogous to music\nfor the eye, and the piano of colours was an absurd mistake. Further, it\nis just on account of the active nature of the sense of sight that it is\nremarkably acute in the case of beasts that hunt, _i.e._, beasts of prey,\nwhile conversely the _passive_ sense of hearing is specially acute in\nthose beasts that are hunted, that flee, and are timid, so that it may\ngive them timely warning of the pursuer that is rushing or creeping upon\nthem.\n\nJust as we have recognised in sight the sense of the understanding, and in\nhearing the sense of the reason, so we might call smell the sense of the\nmemory, because it recalls to us more directly than any other the specific\nimpression of an event or a scene even from the most distant past.\n\nChapter IV. On Knowledge _A Priori_.\n\nFrom the fact that we are able spontaneously to assign and determine the\nlaws of relations in space without having recourse to experience, Plato\nconcludes (_Meno_, p. 353, Bip.) that all learning is mere recollection.\nKant, on the other hand, concludes that space is subjectively conditioned,\nand merely a form of the faculty of knowledge. How far, in this regard,\ndoes Kant stand above Plato!\n\n_Cogito, ergo sum_, is an analytical judgment. Indeed Parmenides held it\nto be an identical judgment: “το γαρ αυτο νοειν εστι τε και ειναι” (_nam\nintelligere et esse idem est_, _Clem. Alex. Strom._, vi. 2, § 23). As\nsuch, however, or indeed even as an analytical judgment, it cannot contain\nany special wisdom; nor yet if, to go still deeper, we seek to deduce it\nas a conclusion from the major premise, _non-entis nulla sunt prædicata_.\nBut with this proposition what Descartes really wished to express was the\ngreat truth that immediate certainty belongs only to self-consciousness,\nto what is subjective. To what is objective, on the other hand, thus to\neverything else, only indirect certainty belongs; for it is arrived at\nthrough self-consciousness; and being thus merely at second hand, it is to\nbe regarded as problematical. Upon this depends the value of this\ncelebrated proposition. As its opposite we may set up, in the sense of the\nKantian philosophy, _cogito, ergo est_, that is, exactly as I think\ncertain relations in things (the mathematical), they must always occur in\nall possible experience;—this was an important, profound, and a late\n_apperçu_, which appeared in the form of the problem as to the\n_possibility of synthetic judgments a priori_, and has actually opened up\nthe way to a deeper knowledge. This problem is the watchword of the\nKantian philosophy, as the former proposition is that of the Cartesian,\nand shows εξ οἱων εισ οἱα.\n\nKant very fitly places his investigations concerning time and space at the\nhead of all the rest. For to the speculative mind these questions present\nthemselves before all others: what is time?—what is this that consists of\nmere movement, without anything that moves it?—and what is space? this\nomnipresent nothing, out of which nothing that exists can escape without\nceasing to be anything at all?\n\nThat time and space depend on the subject, are the mode in which the\nprocess of objective apperception is brought about in the brain, has\nalready a sufficient proof in the absolute impossibility of thinking away\ntime and space, while we can very easily think away everything that is\npresented in them. The hand can leave go of everything except itself.\nHowever, I wish here to illustrate by a few examples and deductions the\nmore exact proofs of this truth which are given by Kant, not for the\npurpose of refuting stupid objections, but for the use of those who may\nhave to expound Kant’s doctrine in future.\n\n“A right-angled equilateral triangle” contains no logical contradiction;\nfor the predicates do not by any means cancel the subject, nor are they\ninconsistent with each other. It is only when their object is constructed\nin pure perception that the impossibility of their union in it appears.\nNow if on this account we were to regard this as a contradiction, then so\nwould every physical impossibility, only discovered to be such after the\nlapse of centuries, be a contradiction; for example, the composition of a\nmetal from its elements, or a mammal with more or fewer than seven\ncervical vertebra,(14) or horns and upper incisors in the same animal. But\nonly _logical_ impossibility is a contradiction, not physical, and just as\nlittle mathematical. Equilateral and rectangled do not contradict each\nother (they coexist in the square), nor does either of them contradict a\ntriangle. Therefore the incompatibility of the above conceptions can never\nbe known by mere _thinking_, but is only discovered by perception—merely\nmental perception, however, which requires no experience, no real object.\nWe should also refer here to the proposition of Giordano Bruno, which is\nalso found in Aristotle: “An infinitely large body is necessarily\nimmovable”—a proposition which cannot rest either upon experience or upon\nthe principle of contradiction, since it speaks of things which cannot\noccur in any experience, and the conceptions “infinitely large” and\n“movable” do not contradict each other; but it is only pure perception\nthat informs us that motion demands a space outside the body, while its\ninfinite size leaves no space over. Suppose, now, it should be objected to\nthe first mathematical example that it is only a question of how complete\na conception of a triangle the person judging has: if the conception is\nquite complete it will also contain the impossibility of a triangle being\nrectangular and also equilateral. The answer to this is: assume that his\nconception is not so complete, yet without recourse to experience he can,\nby the mere construction of the triangle in his imagination, extend his\nconception of it and convince himself for ever of the impossibility of\nthis combination of these conceptions. This process, however, is a\nsynthetic judgment _a priori_, that is, a judgment through which,\nindependently of all experience, and yet with validity for all experience,\nwe form and perfect our conceptions. For, in general, whether a given\njudgment is analytical or synthetical can only be determined in the\nparticular case according as the conception of the subject in the mind of\nthe person judging is more or less complete. The conception “cat” contains\nin the mind of a Cuvier a hundred times more than in that of his servant;\ntherefore the same judgments about it will be synthetical for the latter,\nand only analytical for the former. But if we take the conceptions\nobjectively, and now wish to decide whether a given judgment is analytical\nor synthetical, we must change the predicate into its contradictory\nopposite, and apply this to the subject without a copula. If this gives a\n_contradictio in adjecto_, then the judgment was analytical; otherwise it\nwas synthetical.\n\nThat Arithmetic rests on the pure intuition or perception of time is not\nso evident as that Geometry is based upon that of space.(15) It can be\nproved, however, in the following manner. All counting consists in the\nrepeated affirmation of unity. Only for the purpose of always knowing how\noften we have already affirmed unity do we mark it each time with another\nword: these are the numerals. Now repetition is only possible through\nsuccession. But succession, that is, being after one another, depends\ndirectly upon the intuition or perception of _time_. It is a conception\nwhich can only be understood by means of this; and thus counting also is\nonly possible by means of time. This dependence of all counting upon time\nis also betrayed by the fact that in all languages multiplication is\nexpressed by “time,” thus by a time-concept: _sexies_, ἑξακις, _six fois_,\n_sex mal_. But simple counting is already a multiplication by one, and for\nthis reason in Pestalozzi’s educational establishment the children are\nalways made to multiply thus: “Two times two is four times one.” Aristotle\nalready recognised the close relationship of number and time, and\nexpounded it in the fourteenth chapter of the fourth book of the\n“Physics.” Time is for him “the number of motion” (“ὁ χρονος αριθμος εστι\nκινησεως”). He very profoundly suggests the question whether time could be\nif the soul were not, and answers it in the negative. If arithmetic had\nnot this pure intuition or perception of time at its foundation, it would\nbe no science _a priori_, and therefore its propositions would not have\ninfallible certainty.\n\nAlthough time, like space, is the form of knowledge of the subject, yet,\njust like space, it presents itself as independent of the subject and\ncompletely objective. Against our will, or without our knowledge, it goes\nfast or slow. We ask what o’clock it is; we investigate time, as if it\nwere something quite objective. And what is this objective existence? Not\nthe progress of the stars, or of the clocks, which merely serve to measure\nthe course of time itself, but it is something different from all things,\nand yet, like them, independent of our will and knowledge. It exists only\nin the heads of percipient beings, but the uniformity of its course and\nits independence of the will give it the authority of objectivity.\n\nTime is primarily the form of inner sense. Anticipating the following\nbook, I remark that the only object of inner sense is the individual will\nof the knowing subject. Time is therefore the form by means of which\nself-consciousness becomes possible for the individual will, which\noriginally and in itself is without knowledge. In it the nature of the\nwill, which in itself is simple and identical, appears drawn out into a\ncourse of life. But just on account of this original simplicity and\nidentity of what thus exhibits itself, its _character_ remains always\nprecisely the same, and hence also the course of life itself retains\nthroughout the same key-note, indeed its multifarious events and scenes\nare at bottom just like variations of one and the same theme.\n\nThe _a priori nature of the law of causality_ has, by Englishmen and\nFrenchmen, sometimes not been seen at all, sometimes not rightly conceived\nof; and therefore some of them still prosecute the earlier attempts to\nfind for it an _empirical_ origin. Maine de Biran places this in the\nexperience that the act of will as cause is followed by the movement of\nthe body as effect. But this fact itself is untrue. We certainly do not\nrecognise the really immediate act of will as something different from the\naction of the body, and the two as connected by the bond of causality; but\nboth are one and indivisible. Between them there is no succession; they\nare simultaneous. They are one and the same thing, apprehended in a double\nmanner. That which makes itself known to inner apprehension\n(self-consciousness) as the real _act of will_ exhibits itself at once in\nexternal perception, in which the body exists objectively as an _action_\nof the body. That physiologically the action of the nerve precedes that of\nthe muscle is here immaterial, for it does not come within\nself-consciousness; and we are not speaking here of the relation between\nmuscle and nerve, but of that between the act of will and the action of\nthe body. Now this does not present itself as a causal relation. If these\ntwo presented themselves to us as cause and effect their connection would\nnot be so incomprehensible to us as it actually is; for what we understand\nfrom its cause we understand as far as there is an understanding of things\ngenerally. On the other hand, the movement of our limbs by means of mere\nacts of will is indeed a miracle of such common occurrence that we no\nlonger observe it; but if we once turn our attention to it we become\nkeenly conscious of the incomprehensibility of the matter, just because in\nthis we have something before us which we do _not_ understand as the\neffect of a cause. This apprehension, then, could never lead us to the\nidea of causality, for that never appears in it at all. Maine de Biran\nhimself recognises the perfect simultaneousness of the act of will and the\nmovement (_Nouvelles Considérations des Rapports du Physique au Moral_, p.\n377, 378). In England Thomas Reid (On the First Principles of Contingent\nTruths, Essay IV. c. 5) already asserted that the knowledge of the causal\nrelation has its ground in the nature of the faculty of knowledge itself.\nQuite recently Thomas Brown, in his very tediously composed book, “Inquiry\ninto the Relation of Cause and Effect,” 4th edit., 1835, says much the\nsame thing, that that knowledge springs from an innate, intuitive, and\ninstinctive conviction; thus he is at bottom upon the right path. Quite\nunpardonable, however, is the crass ignorance on account of which in this\nbook of 476 pages, of which 130 are devoted to the refutation of Hume,\nabsolutely no mention is made of Kant, who cleared up the question more\nthan seventy years ago. If Latin had remained the exclusive language of\nscience such a thing would not have occurred. In spite of Brown’s\nexposition, which in the main is correct, a modification of the doctrine\nset up by Maine de Biran, of the empirical origin of the fundamental\nknowledge of the causal relation, has yet found acceptance in England; for\nit is not without a certain degree of plausibility. It is this, that we\nabstract the law of causality from the perceived effect of our own body\nupon other bodies. This was already refuted by Hume. I, however, have\nshown that it is untenable in my work, “_Ueber den Willen in der Natur_”\n(p. 75 of the second edition, p. 82 of the third), from the fact that\nsince we apprehend both our own and other bodies objectively in spatial\nperception, the knowledge of causality must already be there, because it\nis a condition of such perception. The one genuine proof that we are\nconscious of the law of causality _before all experience_ lies in the\nnecessity of making a _transition_ from the sensation, which is only\nempirically given, to its _cause_, in order that it may become perception\nof the external world. Therefore I have substituted this proof for the\nKantian, the incorrectness of which I have shown. A most full and thorough\nexposition of the whole of this important subject, which is only touched\non here, the _a priori_ nature of the law of causality and the\nintellectual nature of empirical perception, will be found in my essay on\nthe principle of sufficient reason, § 21, to which I refer, in order to\navoid the necessity of repeating here what is said there. I have also\nshown there the enormous difference between the mere sensation of the\nsenses and the perception of an objective world, and discovered the wide\ngulf that lies between the two. The law of causality alone can bridge\nacross this gulf, and it presupposes for its application the two other\nforms which are related to it, space and time. Only by means of these\nthree combined is the objective idea attained to. Now whether the\nsensation from which we start to arrive at apprehension arises through the\nresistance which is suffered by our muscular exertion, or through the\nimpression of light upon the retina, or of sound upon the nerves of the\nbrain, &c. &c., is really a matter of indifference. The _sensation_ always\nremains a mere _datum_ for the _understanding_, which alone is capable of\napprehending it as the effect of a cause different from itself, which the\nunderstanding now perceives as external, _i.e._, as something occupying\nand filling space, which is also a form inherent in the intellect prior to\nall experience. Without this intellectual operation, for which the forms\nmust lie ready in us, the perception of an _objective, external world_\ncould never arise from a mere _sensation_ within our skin. How can it ever\nbe supposed that the mere feeling of being hindered in intended motion,\nwhich occurs also in lameness, could be sufficient for this? We may add to\nthis that before I attempt to affect external things _they_ must\nnecessarily have affected me as motives. But this almost presupposes the\napprehension of the external world. According to the theory in question\n(as I have remarked in the place referred to above), a man born without\narms and legs could never attain to the idea of causality, and\nconsequently could never arrive at the apprehension of the external world.\nBut that this is not the case is proved by a fact communicated in\nFroriep’s _Notizen_, July 1838, No. 133—the detailed account, accompanied\nby a likeness, of an Esthonian girl, Eva Lauk, then fourteen years old,\nwho was born entirely without arms or legs. The account concludes with\nthese words: “According to the evidence of her mother, her mental\ndevelopment had been quite as quick as that of her brothers and sisters;\nshe attained just as soon as they did to a correct judgment of size and\ndistance, yet without the assistance of hands.—Dorpat, 1st March 1838, Dr.\nA. Hueck.”\n\nHume’s doctrine also, that the conception of causality arises from the\ncustom of seeing two states constantly following each other, finds a\npractical refutation in the oldest of all successions, that of day and\nnight, which no one has ever held to be cause and effect of each other.\nAnd the same succession also refutes Kant’s false assertion that the\n_objective_ reality of a succession is only known when we apprehend the\ntwo succeeding events as standing in the relation of cause and effect to\neach other. Indeed the converse of this doctrine of Kant’s is true. We\nknow which of the two connected events is the cause and which the effect,\n_empirically_, only in the succession. Again, on the other hand, the\nabsurd assertion of several professors of philosophy in our own day that\ncause and effect are simultaneous can be refuted by the fact that in cases\nin which the succession cannot be perceived on account of its great\nrapidity, we yet assume it with certainty _a priori_, and with it the\nlapse of a certain time. Thus, for example, we know that a certain time\nmust elapse between the falling of the flint and the projection of the\nbullet, although we cannot perceive it, and that this time must further be\ndivided between several events that occur in a strictly determined\nsuccession—the falling of the flint, the striking of the spark, ignition,\nthe spread of the fire, the explosion, and the projection of the bullet.\nNo man ever perceived this succession of events; but because we know which\nis the cause of the others, we thereby also know which must _precede the\nothers in time_, and consequently also that during the course of the whole\nseries a certain time must elapse, although it is so short that it escapes\nour empirical apprehension; for no one will assert that the projection of\nthe bullet is actually simultaneous with the falling of the flint. Thus\nnot only the law of causality, but also its relation to _time_, and the\nnecessity of the _succession_ of cause and effect, is known to us _a\npriori_. If we know which of two events is the cause and which is the\neffect, we also know which precedes the other in time; if, on the\ncontrary, we do not know which is cause and which effect, but only know in\ngeneral that they are causally connected, we seek to discover the\nsuccession empirically, and according to that we determine which is the\ncause and which the effect. The falseness of the assertion that cause and\neffect are simultaneous further appears from the following consideration.\nAn unbroken chain of causes and effects fills the whole of time. (For if\nthis chain were broken the world would stand still, or in order to set it\nin motion again an effect without a cause would have to appear.) Now if\nevery effect were simultaneous with its cause, then every effect would be\nmoved up into the time of its cause, and a chain of causes and effects\ncontaining as many links as before would fill no time at all, still less\nan infinite time, but would be all together in one moment. Thus, under the\nassumption that cause and effect are simultaneous, the course of the world\nshrinks up into an affair of a moment. This proof is analogous to the\nproof that every sheet of paper must have a certain thickness, because\notherwise the whole book would have none. To say _when_ the cause ceases\nand the effect begins is in almost all cases difficult, and often\nimpossible. For the _changes_ (_i.e._, the succession of states) are\ncontinuous, like the time which they fill, and therefore also, like it,\nthey are infinitely divisible. But their succession is as necessarily\ndetermined and as unmistakable as that of the moments of time itself, and\neach of them is called, with reference to the one which precedes it,\n“effect,” and with reference to the one which follows it, “cause.”\n\n_Every change in the material world can only take place because another\nhas immediately preceded it_: this is the true and the whole content of\nthe law of causality. But no conception has been more misused in\nphilosophy than that of _cause_, by means of the favourite trick or\nblunder of conceiving it too widely, taking it too generally, through\nabstract thinking. Since Scholasticism, indeed properly since Plato and\nAristotle, philosophy has been for the most part a _systematic misuse of\ngeneral conceptions_. Such, for example, are substance, ground, cause, the\ngood, perfection, necessity, and very many others. A tendency of the mind\nto work with such abstract and too widely comprehended conceptions has\nshown itself almost at all times. It may ultimately rest upon a certain\nindolence of the intellect, which finds it too difficult a task to be\nconstantly controlling thought by perception. By degrees such unduly wide\nconceptions come to be used almost like algebraical symbols, and tossed\nabout like them, and thus philosophy is reduced to a mere process of\ncombination, a kind of reckoning which (like all calculations) employs and\ndemands only the lower faculties. Indeed there finally results from this a\nmere juggling with words, of which the most shocking example is afforded\nus by the mind-destroying Hegelism, in which it is carried to the extent\nof pure nonsense. But Scholasticism also often degenerated into\nword-juggling. Nay even the “Topi” of Aristotle—very abstract principles,\nconceived with absolute generality, which one could apply to the most\ndifferent kinds of subjects, and always bring into the field in arguing\neither _pro_ or _contra_—have also their origin in this misuse of general\nconceptions. We find innumerable examples of the way the Schoolmen worked\nwith such abstractions in their writings, especially in those of Thomas\nAquinas. But philosophy really pursued the path which was entered on by\nthe Schoolmen down to the time of Locke and Kant, who at last bethought\nthemselves as to the origin of conceptions. Indeed we find Kant himself,\nin his earlier years, still upon that path, in his “Proof of the Existence\nof God” (p. 191 of the first volume of Rosenkranz’s edition), where the\nconceptions substance, ground, reality, are used in such a way as would\nnever have been possible if he had gone back to the _source_ of these\nconceptions and to their _true content_ which is determined thereby. For\nthen he would have found as the source and content of _substance_ simply\nmatter, of ground (if things of the real world are in question) simply\ncause, that is, the prior change which brings about the later change, &c.\nIt is true that in this case such an investigation would not have led to\nthe intended result. But everywhere, as here, such unduly wide\nconceptions, under which, therefore, more was subsumed than their true\ncontent would have justified, there have arisen false principles, and from\nthese false systems. Spinoza’s whole method of demonstration rests upon\nsuch uninvestigated and too widely comprehended conceptions. Now here lies\nthe great merit of Locke, who, in order to counteract all that dogmatic\nunreality, insisted upon the investigation of the _origin of the\nconceptions_, and thus led back to _perception and experience_. Bacon had\nworked in a similar frame of mind, yet more with reference to Physics than\nto Metaphysics. Kant followed the path entered upon by Locke, but in a\nhigher sense and much further, as has already been mentioned above. To the\nmen of mere show who succeeded in diverting the attention of the public\nfrom Kant to themselves the results obtained by Locke and Kant were\ninconvenient. But in such a case they know how to ignore both the dead and\nthe living. Thus without hesitation they forsook the only right path which\nhad at last been found by those wise men, and philosophised at random with\nall kinds of indiscriminately collected conceptions, unconcerned as to\ntheir origin and content, till at last the substance of the Hegelian\nphilosophy, wise beyond measure, was that the conceptions had no origin at\nall, but were rather themselves the origin and source of things. But Kant\nhas erred in this respect. He has too much neglected empirical perception\nfor the sake of _pure_ perception—a point which I have fully discussed in\nmy criticism of his philosophy. With me perception is throughout the\nsource of all knowledge. I early recognised the misleading and insidious\nnature of abstractions, and in 1813, in my essay on the principle of\nsufficient reason, I pointed out the difference of the relations which are\nthought under _this_ conception. General conceptions must indeed be the\nmaterial in which philosophy deposits and stores up its knowledge, but not\nthe source from which it draws it; the _terminus ad quem_, not _a quo_. It\nis not, as Kant defines it, a science _drawn from_ conceptions, but a\nscience _in_ conceptions. Thus the conception of causality also, with\nwhich we are here concerned, has always been taken far too widely by\nphilosophers for the furtherance of their dogmatic ends, and much was\nimported into it which does not belong to it at all. Hence arose\npropositions such as the following: “All that is has its cause”—“the\neffect cannot contain more than the cause, thus nothing that was not also\nin the cause”—“_causa est nobilior suo effectu_,” and many others just as\nunwarranted. The following subtilty of that insipid gossip Proclus affords\nan elaborate and specially lucid example of this. It occurs in his\n“_Institutio Theologica_,” § 76: “Παν το απο ακινητου γιγνομενον αιτιας,\nαμεταβλητον εχει την ὑπαρξιν; παν δε το απο κινουμενης, μεταβλητην; ει γαρ\nακινητον εστι παντῃ το ποιουν, ου δια κινησεως, αλλ᾽ αυτῳ τῳ ειναι παραγει\nτο δευτερον αφ᾽ ἑαυτου.” (_Quidquid ab immobili causa manat, immutabilem\nhabet essentiam [substantiam]. Quidquid vero a mobili causa manat,\nessentiam habet mutabilem. Si enim illud, quod aliquid facit, est prorsus\nimmobile, non per motum, sed per ipsum Esse producit ipsum secundum ex se\nipso._) Excellent! But just show me a cause which is not itself set in\nmotion: it is simply impossible. But here, as in so many cases,\nabstraction has thought away all determinations down to that one which it\nis desired to make use of without regard to the fact that the latter\ncannot exist without the former. The only correct expression of the law of\ncausality is this: _Every change has its cause in another change which\nimmediately precedes it_. If something _happens_, _i.e._, if a new state\nof things appears, _i.e._, if something is _changed_, then something else\nmust have _changed_ immediately before, and something else again before\nthis, and so on _ad infinitum_, for a _first_ cause is as impossible to\nconceive as a beginning of time or a limit of space. More than this the\nlaw of causality does not assert. Thus its claims only arise in the case\nof _changes_. So long as nothing changes there can be no question of a\ncause. For there is no _a priori_ ground for inferring from the existence\nof given things, _i.e._, states of matter, their previous non-existence,\nand from this again their coming into being, that is to say, there is no\n_a priori_ ground for inferring a change. Therefore the mere existence of\na thing does not justify us in inferring that it has a cause. Yet there\nmay be _a posteriori_ reasons, that is, reasons drawn from previous\nexperience, for the assumption that the present state or condition did not\nalways exist, but has only come into existence in consequence of another\nstate, and therefore by means of a change, the cause of which is then to\nbe sought, and also the cause of this cause. Here then we are involved in\nthe _infinite regressus_ to which the application of the law of causality\nalways leads. We said above: “_Things_, _i.e._, _states or conditions of\nmatter,_” for _change_ and _causality_ have only to do with states or\nconditions. It is these states which we understand by _form_, in the wider\nsense; and only the forms change, the matter is permanent. Thus it is only\nthe form which is subject to the law of causality. But the form\nconstitutes the _thing_, _i.e._, it is the ground of _the difference_ of\nthings; while matter must be thought as the same in all. Therefore the\nSchoolmen said, “_Forma dat esse rei;_” more accurately this proposition\nwould run: _Forma dat rei essentiam, materia existentiam_. Therefore the\nquestion as to the cause of a _thing_ always concerns merely its form,\n_i.e._, its state or quality, and not its matter, and indeed only the\nformer so far as we have grounds for assuming that it has not _always_\nexisted, but has come into being by means of a _change_. The union of\n_form_ and _matter_, or of _essentia_ and _existentia_, gives the\n_concrete_, which is always particular; thus, the _thing_. And it is the\n_forms_ whose union with _matter_, _i.e._, whose appearance in matter by\nmeans of a _change_, are subject to the law of causality. By taking the\nconception _too widely_ in the abstract the mistake slipped in of\nextending causality to the thing absolutely, that is, to its whole inner\nnature and existence, thus also to matter, and ultimately it was thought\njustifiable to ask for a cause of the world itself. This is the origin of\nthe _cosmological proof_. This proof begins by inferring from the\nexistence of the world its non-existence, which preceded its existence,\nand such an inference is quite unjustifiable; it ends, however, with the\nmost fearful inconsistency, for it does away altogether with the law of\ncausality, from which alone it derives all its evidencing power, for it\nstops at a first cause, and will not go further; thus ends, as it were, by\ncommitting parricide, as the bees kill the drones after they have served\ntheir end. All the talk about the _absolute_ is referable to a shamefast,\nand therefore disguised cosmological proof, which, in the face of the\n“Critique of Pure Reason,” has passed for philosophy in Germany for the\nlast sixty years. What does the absolute mean? Something that is, and of\nwhich (under pain of punishment) we dare not ask further whence and why it\nis. A precious rarity for professors of philosophy! In the case, however,\nof the honestly expressed cosmological proof, through the assumption of a\nfirst cause, and therefore of a first beginning in a time which has\nabsolutely no beginning, this beginning is always pushed further back by\nthe question: Why not earlier? And so far back indeed that one never gets\ndown from it to the present, but is always marvelling that the present\nitself did not occur already millions of years ago. In general, then, the\nlaw of causality applies to all things in the world, but not to the world\nitself, for it is _immanent_ in the world, not _transcendent; with_ it it\ncomes into action, and _with_ it it is abolished. This depends ultimately\nupon the fact that it belongs to the mere form of our understanding, like\nthe whole of the objective world, which accordingly is merely phenomenal,\nand is conditioned by the understanding. Thus the law of causality has\nfull application, without any exception, to all things in the world, of\ncourse in respect of their form, to the variation of these forms, and thus\nto their changes. It is valid for the actions of men as for the impact of\na stone, yet, as we have said always, merely with regard to events, to\n_changes_. But if we abstract from its origin in the understanding and try\nto look at it as purely objective, it will be found in ultimate analysis\nto depend upon the fact that everything that acts does so by virtue of its\noriginal, and therefore eternal or timeless, power; therefore its present\neffect would necessarily have occurred infinitely earlier, that is, before\nall conceivable time, but that it lacked the temporal condition. This\ntemporal condition is the occasion, _i.e._, the cause, on account of which\nalone the effect only takes place _now_, but now takes place necessarily;\nthe cause assigns it its place in time.\n\nBut in consequence of that unduly wide view in abstract thought of the\nconception _cause_, which was considered above, it has been confounded\nwith the conception of _force_. This is something completely different\nfrom the cause, but yet is that which imparts to every cause its\ncausality, _i.e._, the capability of producing an effect. I have explained\nthis fully and thoroughly in the second book of the first volume, also in\n“The Will in Nature,” and finally also in the second edition of the essay\non the principle of sufficient reason, § 20, p. 44 (third edition, p. 45).\nThis confusion is to be found in its most aggravated form in Maine de\nBiran’s book mentioned above, and this is dealt with more fully in the\nplace last referred to; but apart from this it is also very common; for\nexample, when people seek for the cause of any original force, such as\ngravitation. Kant himself (_Über den Einzig Möglichen Beweisgrund_, vol.\ni. p. 211-215 of Rosenkranz’s edition) calls the forces of nature\n“efficient causes,” and says “gravity is a cause.” Yet it is impossible to\nsee to the bottom of his thought so long as force and cause are not\ndistinctly recognised as completely different. But the use of abstract\nconceptions leads very easily to their confusion if the consideration of\ntheir origin is set aside. The knowledge of causes and effects, always\n_perceptive_, which rests on the form of the understanding, is neglected\nin order to stick to the abstraction _cause_. In this way alone is the\nconception of causality, with all its simplicity, so very frequently\nwrongly apprehended. Therefore even in Aristotle (“Metaph.,” iv. 2) we\nfind causes divided into four classes which are utterly falsely, and\nindeed crudely conceived. Compare with it my classification of causes as\nset forth for the first time in my essay on sight and colour, chap. 1, and\ntouched upon briefly in the sixth paragraph of the first volume of the\npresent work, but expounded at full length in my prize essay on the\nfreedom of the will, p. 30-33. Two things in nature remain untouched by\nthat chain of causality which stretches into infinity in both directions;\nthese are matter and the forces of nature. They are both conditions of\ncausality, while everything else is conditioned by it. For the one\n(matter) is that _in_ which the states and their changes appear; the other\n(forces of nature) is that by virtue of which alone they can appear at\nall. Here, however, one must remember that in the second book, and later\nand more thoroughly in “The Will in Nature,” the natural forces are shown\nto be identical with the will in us; but matter appears as the mere\n_visibility of the will_; so that ultimately it also may in a certain\nsense be regarded as identical with the will.\n\nOn the other hand, not less true and correct is what is explained in § 4\nof the first book, and still better in the second edition of the essay on\nthe principle of sufficient reason at the end of § 21, p. 77 (third\nedition, p. 82), that matter is causality itself objectively comprehended,\nfor its entire nature consists in _acting in general_, so that it itself\nis thus the activity (ενεργεια = reality) of things generally, as it were\nthe abstraction of all their different kinds of acting. Accordingly, since\nthe essence, _essentia_, of matter consists in _action in general_, and\nthe reality, _existentia_, of things consists in their materiality, which\nthus again is one with action in general, it may be asserted of matter\nthat in it _existentia_ and _essentia_ unite and are one, for it has no\nother attribute than _existence itself_ in general and independent of all\nfuller definitions of it. On the other hand, all _empirically_ given\nmatter, thus all material or matter in the special sense (which our\nignorant materialists at the present day confound with matter), has\nalready entered the framework of the _forms_ and manifests itself only\nthrough their qualities and accidents, because in experience every action\nis of quite a definite and special kind, and is never merely general.\nTherefore pure matter is an object of _thought_ alone, not of\n_perception_, which led Plotinus (_Enneas II._, lib. iv., c. 8 & 9) and\nGiordano Bruno (_Della Causa_, dial. 4) to make the paradoxical assertion\nthat matter has no extension, for extension is inseparable from the form,\nand that therefore it is _incorporeal_. Yet Aristotle had already taught\nthat it is not a body although it is corporeal: “σωμα μεν ουκ αν ειη,\nσωματικη δε” (_Stob. Ecl._, lib. i., c. 12, § 5). In reality we think\nunder _pure matter_ only action, in the abstract, quite independent of the\n_kind_ of action, thus _pure causality_ itself; and as such it is not an\n_object_ but a _condition_ of experience, just like space and time. This\nis the reason why in the accompanying table of our pure _a priori_\nknowledge matter is able to take the place of causality, and therefore\nappears along with space and time as the third pure form, and therefore as\ndependent on our intellect.\n\nThis table contains all the fundamental truths which are rooted in our\nperceptive or intuitive knowledge _a priori_, expressed as first\nprinciples independent of each other. What is special, however, what forms\nthe content of arithmetic and geometry, is not given here, nor yet what\nonly results from the union and application of those formal principles of\nknowledge. This is the subject of the “Metaphysical First Principles of\nNatural Science” expounded by Kant, to which this table in some measure\nforms the propædutic and introduction, and with which it therefore stands\nin direct connection. In this table I have primarily had in view the very\nremarkable _parallelism_ of those _a priori_ principles of knowledge which\nform the framework of all experience, but specially also the fact that, as\nI have explained in § 4 of the first volume, matter (and also causality)\nis to be regarded as a combination, or if it is preferred, an\namalgamation, of space and time. In agreement with this, we find that what\ngeometry is for the pure perception or intuition of space, and arithmetic\nfor that of time, Kant’s _phoronomy_ is for the pure perception or\nintuition of the two _united_. For matter is primarily that which is\nmovable in space. The mathematical point cannot even be conceived as\nmovable, as Aristotle has shown (“Physics,” vi. 10). This philosopher also\nhimself provided the first example of such a science, for in the fifth and\nsixth books of his “Physics” he determined _a priori_ the laws of rest and\nmotion.\n\nNow this table may be regarded at pleasure either as a collection of the\neternal laws of the world, and therefore as the basis of our ontology, or\nas a chapter of the physiology of the brain, according as one assumes the\nrealistic or the idealistic point of view; but the second is in the last\ninstance right. On this point, indeed, we have already come to an\nunderstanding in the first chapter; yet I wish further to illustrate it\nspecially by an example. Aristotle’s book “_De Xenophane_,” &c., commences\nwith these weighty words of Xenophanes: “Αϊδιον ειναι φησιν, ει τι εστιν,\nειπερ μη ενδεχεται γενεσθαι μηδεν εκ μηδενος.” (_Æternum esse, inquit,\nquicquid est, siquidem fieri non potest, ut ex nihilo quippiam existat._)\nHere, then, Xenophanes judges as to the origin of things, as regards its\npossibility, and of this origin he can have had no experience, even by\nanalogy; nor indeed does he appeal to experience, but judges\napodictically, and therefore _a priori_. How can he do this if as a\nstranger he looks from without into a world that exists purely\nobjectively, that is, independently of his knowledge? How can he, an\nephemeral being hurrying past, to whom only a hasty glance into such a\nworld is permitted, judge apodictically, _a priori_ and without experience\nconcerning that world, the possibility of its existence and origin? The\nsolution of this riddle is that the man has only to do with his own ideas,\nwhich as such are the work of his brain, and the constitution of which is\nmerely the manner or mode in which alone the function of his brain can be\nfulfilled, _i.e._, the form of his perception. He thus judges only as to\nthe _phenomena of his own brain_, and declares what enters into its forms,\ntime, space, and causality, and what does not. In this he is perfectly at\nhome and speaks apodictically.

On this account it is itself, as regards\nits existence, not subject to the law of causality, and thus has neither\ncome into being nor passes away, for otherwise the law of causality would\nbe applied to itself. Since now causality is known to us _a priori_, the\nconception of matter, as the indestructible basis of all that exists, can\nso far take its place in the knowledge we possess _a priori_, inasmuch as\nit is only the realisation of an _a priori_ form of our knowledge. For as\nsoon as we see anything that acts or is causally efficient it presents\nitself _eo ipso_ as material, and conversely anything material presents\nitself as necessarily active or causally efficient. They are in fact\ninterchangeable conceptions. Therefore the word “actual” is used as\nsynonymous with “material;” and also the Greek κατ᾽ ενεργειαν, in\nopposition to κατα δυναμιν, reveals the same source, for ενεργεια\nsignifies action in general; so also with _actu_ in opposition to\n_potentia_, and the English “actually” for “_wirklich_.” What is called\nspace-occupation, or impenetrability, and regarded as the essential\npredicate of body (_i.e._ of what is material), is merely that _kind of\naction_ which belongs to _all_ bodies without exception, the mechanical.\nIt is this universality alone, by virtue of which it belongs to the\nconception of body, and follows _a priori_ from this conception, and\ntherefore cannot be thought away from it without doing away with the\nconception itself—it is this, I say, that distinguishes it from any other\nkind of action, such as that of electricity or chemistry, or light or\nheat. Kant has very accurately analysed this space-occupation of the\nmechanical mode of activity into repulsive and attractive force, just as a\ngiven mechanical force is analysed into two others by means of the\nparallelogram of forces. But this is really only the thoughtful analysis\nof the phenomenon into its two constituent parts. The two forces in\nconjunction exhibit the body within its own limits, that is, in a definite\nvolume, while the one alone would diffuse it into infinity, and the other\nalone would contract it to a point. Notwithstanding this reciprocal\nbalancing or neutralisation, the body still acts upon other bodies which\ncontest its space with the first force, repelling them, and with the other\nforce, in gravitation, attracting all bodies in general. So that the two\nforces are not extinguished in their product, as, for instance, two equal\nforces acting in different directions, or +E and -E, or oxygen and\nhydrogen in water. That impenetrability and gravity really exactly\ncoincide is shown by their empirical inseparableness, in that the one\nnever appears without the other, although we can separate them in thought.\n\nI must not, however, omit to mention that the doctrine of Kant referred\nto, which forms the fundamental thought of the second part of his\n“Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science,” thus of the Dynamics,\nwas distinctly and fully expounded before Kant by Priestley, in his\nexcellent “Disquisitions on Matter and Spirit,” § 1 and 2, a book which\nappeared in 1777, and the second edition in 1782, while Kant’s work was\npublished in 1786. Unconscious recollection may certainly be assumed in\nthe case of subsidiary thoughts, flashes of wit, comparisons, &c., but not\nin the case of the principal and fundamental thought. Shall we then\nbelieve that Kant silently appropriated such important thoughts of another\nman? and this from a book which at that time was new? Or that this book\nwas unknown to him, and that the same thoughts sprang up in two minds\nwithin a short time? The explanation, also, which Kant gives, in the\n“Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science” (first edition, p. 88;\nRosenkranz’s edition, p. 384), of the real difference between fluids and\nsolids, is in substance already to be found in Kaspar Freidr. Wolff’s\n“Theory of Generation,” Berlin 1764, p. 132. But what are we to say if we\nfind Kant’s most important and brilliant doctrine, that of the ideality of\nspace and the merely phenomenal existence of the corporeal world, already\nexpressed by Maupertuis thirty years earlier? This will be found more\nfully referred to in Frauenstädt’s letters on my philosophy, Letter 14.\nMaupertuis expresses this paradoxical doctrine so decidedly, and yet\nwithout adducing any proof of it, that one must suppose that he also took\nit from somewhere else. It is very desirable that the matter should be\nfurther investigated, and as this would demand tiresome and extensive\nresearches, some German Academy might very well make the question the\nsubject of a prize essay. Now in the same relation as that in which Kant\nhere stands to Priestley, and perhaps also to Kaspar Wolff, and Maupertuis\nor his predecessor, Laplace stands to Kant. For the principal and\nfundamental thought of Laplace’s admirable and certainly correct theory of\nthe origin of the planetary system, which is set forth in his “_Exposition\ndu Système du Monde_,” liv. v. c. 2, was expressed by Kant nearly fifty\nyears before, in 1755, in his “_Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels_,”\nand more fully in 1763 in his “_Einzig möglichen Beweisgrund des Daseyns\nGottes_,” ch. 7. Moreover, in the later work he gives us to understand\nthat Lambert in his “_Kosmologischen Briefen_,” 1761, tacitly adopted that\ndoctrine from him, and these letters at the same time also appeared in\nFrench (_Lettres Cosmologiques sur la Constitution de l’Univers_). We are\ntherefore obliged to assume that Laplace knew that Kantian doctrine.\nCertainly he expounds the matter more thoroughly, strikingly, and fully,\nand at the same time more simply than Kant, as is natural from his more\nprofound astronomical knowledge; yet in the main it is to be found clearly\nexpressed in Kant, and on account of the importance of the matter, would\nalone have been sufficient to make his name immortal. It cannot but\ndisturb us very much if we find minds of the first order under suspicion\nof dishonesty, which would be a scandal to those of the lowest order. For\nwe feel that theft is even more inexcusable in a rich man than in a poor\none. We dare not, however, be silent; for here we are posterity, and must\nbe just, as we hope that posterity will some day be just to us. Therefore,\nas a third example, I will add to these cases, that the fundamental\nthoughts of the “Metamorphosis of Plants,” by Goethe, were already\nexpressed by Kaspar Wolff in 1764 in his “Theory of Generation,” p. 148,\n229, 243, &c. Indeed, is it otherwise with the _system of gravitation_?\nthe discovery of which is on the Continent of Europe always ascribed to\nNewton, while in England the learned at least know very well that it\nbelongs to Robert Hooke, who in the year 1666, in a “Communication to the\nRoyal Society,” expounds it quite distinctly, although only as an\nhypothesis and without proof. The principal passage of this communication\nis quoted in Dugald Stewart’s “Philosophy of the Human Mind,” and is\nprobably taken from Robert Hooke’s Posthumous Works. The history of the\nmatter, and how Newton got into difficulty by it, is also to be found in\nthe “_Biographie Universelle_,” article Newton. Hooke’s priority is\ntreated as an established fact in a short history of astronomy, _Quarterly\nReview_, August 1828. Further details on this subject are to be found in\nmy “_Parerga_,” vol. ii., § 86 (second edition, § 88). The story of the\nfall of an apple is a fable as groundless as it is popular, and is quite\nwithout authority.\n\n(2) To No. 18 of Matter.\n\n_The quantity of a motion_ (_quantitas motus_, already in Descartes) is\nthe product of the mass into the velocity.\n\nThis law is the basis not only of the doctrine of impact in mechanics, but\nalso of that of equilibrium in statics. From the force of impact which two\nbodies with the same velocity exert the relation of their masses to each\nother may be determined. Thus of two hammers striking with the same\nvelocity, the one which has the greater mass will drive the nail deeper\ninto the wall or the post deeper into the earth. For example, a hammer\nweighing six pounds with a velocity = 6 effects as much as a hammer\nweighing three pounds with a velocity = 12, for in both cases the quantity\nof motion or the momentum = 36. Of two balls rolling at the same pace, the\none which has the greater mass will impel a third ball at rest to a\ngreater distance than the ball of less mass can. For the mass of the first\nmultiplied by the same velocity gives a _greater quantity of motion_, or a\n_greater momentum_. The cannon carries further than the gun, because an\nequal velocity communicated to a much greater mass gives a much _greater\nquantity of motion_, which resists longer the retarding effect of gravity.\nFor the same reason, the same arm will throw a lead bullet further than a\nstone one of equal magnitude, or a large stone further than quite a small\none. And therefore also a case-shot does not carry so far as a ball-shot.\n\nThe same law lies at the foundation of the theory of the lever and of the\nbalance. For here also the smaller mass, on the longer arm of the lever or\nbeam of the balance, has a greater velocity in falling; and multiplied by\nthis it may be equal to, or indeed exceed, the _quantity of motion_ or the\n_momentum_ of the greater mass at the shorter arm of the lever. In the\nstate of rest brought about by _equilibrium_ this velocity exists merely\nin intention or virtually, _potentiâ_, not _actu_; but it acts just as\nwell as _actu_, which is very remarkable.\n\nThe following explanation will be more easily understood now that these\ntruths have been called to mind.\n\nThe quantity of a given matter can only be estimated in general according\nto its force, and its force can only be known in its _expression_. Now\nwhen we are considering matter only as regards its quantity, not its\nquality, this expression can only be mechanical, _i.e._, it can only\nconsist in motion which it imparts to other matter. For only in motion\ndoes the force of matter become, so to speak, _alive_; hence the\nexpression _vis viva_ for the manifestation of force of matter in motion.\nAccordingly the only measure of the quantity of a given matter is the\n_quantity of its motion_, or its _momentum_. In this, however, if it is\ngiven, the _quantity_ of matter still appears in conjunction and\namalgamated with its other factor, _velocity_. Therefore if we want to\nknow the quantity of matter (the mass) this other factor must be\neliminated. Now the velocity is known directly; for it is _S/T_. But the\nother factor, which remains when this is eliminated, can always be known\nonly _relatively_ in comparison with other masses, which again can only be\nknown themselves by means of the _quantity of their motion_, or their\n_momentum_, thus in their combination with velocity. We must therefore\ncompare one _quantity of motion_ with the other, and then subtract the\nvelocity from both, in order to see how much each of them owed to its\nmass. This is done by weighing the masses against each other, in which\nthat _quantity of motion_ is compared which, in each of the two masses,\ncalls forth the attractive power of the earth that acts upon both only in\nproportion to their _quantity_. Therefore there are two kinds of weighing.\nEither we impart to the two masses to be compared _equal_ velocity, in\norder to find out which of the two now _communicates_ motion to the other,\nthus itself _has_ a greater quantity of motion, which, since the velocity\nis the same on both sides, is to be ascribed to the other factor of the\n_quantity of motion_ or the _momentum_, thus to the mass (common balance).\nOr we weigh, by investigating how much _more velocity_ the one mass must\nreceive than the other has, in order to be equal to the latter in\n_quantity of motion_ or _momentum_, and therefore allow no more motion to\nbe communicated to itself by the other; for then in proportion as its\nvelocity must exceed that of the other, its mass, _i.e._, the quantity of\nits matter, is less than that of the other (steelyard). This estimation of\nmasses by weighing depends upon the favourable circumstance that the\nmoving force, in itself, acts upon both quite equally, and each of the two\nis in a position to _communicate_ to the other directly its surplus\n_quantity of motion_ or _momentum_, so that it becomes visible.\n\nThe substance of these doctrines has long ago been expressed by Newton and\nKant, but through the connection and the clearness of this exposition I\nbelieve I have made it more intelligible, so that that insight is possible\nfor all which I regarded as necessary for the justification of proposition\nNo. 18.\n\nSecond Half. The Doctrine of the Abstract Idea, or Thinking.\n\nChapter V.(16) On The Irrational Intellect.\n\nIt must be possible to arrive at a complete knowledge of the consciousness\nof the brutes, for we can construct it by abstracting certain properties\nof our own consciousness. On the other hand, there enters into the\nconsciousness of the brute instinct, which is much more developed in all\nof them than in man, and in some of them extends to what we call\nmechanical instinct.\n\nThe brutes have understanding without having reason, and therefore they\nhave knowledge of perception but no abstract knowledge. They apprehend\ncorrectly, and also grasp the immediate causal connection, in the case of\nthe higher species even through several links of its chain, but they do\nnot, properly speaking, _think_. For they lack _conceptions_, that is,\nabstract ideas. The first consequence of this, however, is the want of a\nproper memory, which applies even to the most sagacious of the brutes, and\nit is just this which constitutes the principal difference between their\nconsciousness and that of men. Perfect intelligence depends upon the\ndistinct consciousness of the past and of the eventual future, _as such_,\nand in connection with the present. The special memory which this demands\nis therefore an orderly, connected, and thinking retrospective\nrecollection. This, however, is only possible by means of _general\nconceptions_, the assistance of which is required by what is entirely\nindividual, in order that it may be recalled in its order and connection.\nFor the boundless multitude of things and events of the same and similar\nkinds, in the course of our life, does not admit directly of a perceptible\nand individual recollection of each particular, for which neither the\npowers of the most comprehensive memory nor our time would be sufficient.\nTherefore all this can only be preserved by subsuming it under general\nconceptions, and the consequent reference to relatively few principles, by\nmeans of which we then have always at command an orderly and adequate\nsurvey of our past. We can only present to ourselves in perception\nparticular scenes of the past, but the time that has passed since then and\nits content we are conscious of only in the abstract by means of\nconceptions of things and numbers which now represent days and years,\ntogether with their content. The memory of the brutes, on the contrary,\nlike their whole intellect, is confined to what they _perceive_, and\nprimarily consists merely in the fact that a recurring impression presents\nitself as having already been experienced, for the present perception\nrevivifies the traces of an earlier one. Their memory is therefore always\ndependent upon what is now actually present. Just on this account,\nhowever, this excites anew the sensation and the mood which the earlier\nphenomenon produced. Thus the dog recognises acquaintances, distinguishes\nfriends from enemies, easily finds again the path it has once travelled,\nthe houses it has once visited, and at the sight of a plate or a stick is\nat once put into the mood associated with them. All kinds of training\ndepend upon the use of this perceptive memory and on the force of habit,\nwhich in the case of animals is specially strong. It is therefore just as\ndifferent from human education as perception is from thinking. We\nourselves are in certain cases, in which memory proper refuses us its\nservice, confined to that merely perceptive recollection, and thus we can\nmeasure the difference between the two from our own experience. For\nexample, at the sight of a person whom it appears to us we know, although\nwe are not able to remember when or where we saw him; or again, when we\nvisit a place where we once were in early childhood, that is, while our\nreason was yet undeveloped, and which we have therefore entirely\nforgotten, and yet feel that the present impression is one which we have\nalready experienced. This is the nature of all the recollections of the\nbrutes. We have only to add that in the case of the most sagacious this\nmerely perceptive memory rises to a certain degree of _phantasy_, which\nagain assists it, and by virtue of which, for example, the image of its\nabsent master floats before the mind of the dog and excites a longing\nafter him, so that when he remains away long it seeks for him everywhere.\nIts dreams also depend upon this phantasy. The consciousness of the brutes\nis accordingly a mere succession of presents, none of which, however,\nexist as future before they appear, nor as past after they have vanished;\nwhich is the specific difference of human consciousness. Hence the brutes\nhave infinitely less to _suffer_ than we have, because they know no other\npains but those which the _present_ directly brings. But the present is\nwithout extension, while the future and the past, which contain most of\nthe causes of our suffering, are widely extended, and to their actual\ncontent there is added that which is merely possible, which opens up an\nunlimited field for desire and aversion. The brutes, on the contrary,\nundisturbed by these, enjoy quietly and peacefully each present moment,\neven if it is only bearable. Human beings of very limited capacity perhaps\napproach them in this. Further, the sufferings which belong _purely_ to\nthe present can only be physical. Indeed the brutes do not properly\nspeaking feel death: they can only know it when it appears, and then they\nare already no more. Thus then the life of the brute is a continuous\npresent. It lives on without reflection, and exists wholly in the present;\neven the great majority of men live with very little reflection. Another\nconsequence of the special nature of the intellect of the brutes, which we\nhave explained is the perfect accordance of their consciousness with their\nenvironment. Between the brute and the external world there is nothing,\nbut between us and the external world there is always our thought about\nit, which makes us often inapproachable to it, and it to us. Only in the\ncase of children and very primitive men is this wall of partition so thin\nthat in order to see what goes on in them we only need to see what goes on\nround about them. Therefore the brutes are incapable alike of purpose and\ndissimulation; they reserve nothing. In this respect the dog stands to the\nman in the same relation as a glass goblet to a metal one, and this helps\ngreatly to endear the dog so much to us, for it affords us great pleasure\nto see all those inclinations and emotions which we so often conceal\ndisplayed simply and openly in him. In general, the brutes always play, as\nit were, with their hand exposed; and therefore we contemplate with so\nmuch pleasure their behaviour towards each other, both when they belong to\nthe same and to different species. It is characterised by a certain stamp\nof innocence, in contrast to the conduct of men, which is withdrawn from\nthe innocence of nature by the entrance of reason, and with it of prudence\nor deliberation. Hence human conduct has throughout the stamp of intention\nor deliberate purpose, the absence of which, and the consequent\ndetermination by the impulse of the moment, is the fundamental\ncharacteristic of all the action of the brutes. No brute is capable of a\npurpose properly so-called. To conceive and follow out a purpose is the\nprerogative of man, and it is a prerogative which is rich in consequences.\nCertainly an instinct like that of the bird of passage or the bee, still\nmore a permanent, persistent desire, a longing like that of the dog for\nits absent master, may present the appearance of a purpose, with which,\nhowever, it must not be confounded. Now all this has its ultimate ground\nin the relation between the human and the brute intellect, which may also\nbe thus expressed: The brutes have only _direct_ knowledge, while we, in\naddition to this, have _indirect_ knowledge; and the advantage which in\nmany things—for example, in trigonometry and analysis, in machine work\ninstead of hand work, &c.—indirect has over direct knowledge appears here\nalso. Thus again we may say: The brutes have only a _single_ intellect, we\na _double_ intellect, both perceptive and thinking, and the operation of\nthe two often go on independently of each other. We perceive one thing,\nand we think another. Often, again, they act upon each other. This way of\nputting the matter enables us specially to understand that natural\nopenness and naivete of the brutes, referred to above, as contrasted with\nthe concealment of man.\n\nHowever, the law _natura non facit saltus_ is not entirely suspended even\nwith regard to the intellect of the brutes, though certainly the step from\nthe brute to the human intelligence is the greatest which nature has made\nin the production of her creatures. In the most favoured individuals of\nthe highest species of the brutes there certainly sometimes appears,\nalways to our astonishment, a faint trace of reflection, reason, the\ncomprehension of words, of thought, purpose, and deliberation. The most\nstriking indications of this kind are afforded by the elephant, whose\nhighly developed intelligence is heightened and supported by an experience\nof a lifetime which sometimes extends to two hundred years. He has often\ngiven unmistakable signs, recorded in well-known anecdotes, of\npremeditation, which, in the case of brutes, always astonishes us more\nthan anything else. Such, for instance, is the story of the tailor on whom\nan elephant revenged himself for pricking him with a needle. I wish,\nhowever, to rescue from oblivion a parallel case to this, because it has\nthe advantage of being authenticated by judicial investigation. On the\n27th of August 1830 there was held at Morpeth, in England, a coroner’s\ninquest on the keeper, Baptist Bernhard, who was killed by his elephant.\nIt appeared from the evidence that two years before he had offended the\nelephant grossly, and now, without any occasion, but on a favourable\nopportunity, the elephant had seized him and crushed him. (See the\n_Spectator_ and other English papers of that day.) For special information\non the intelligence of brutes I recommend Leroy’s excellent book, “_Sur\nl’Intelligence des Animaux_,” _nouv. éd._ 1802.\n\nChapter VI. On The Doctrine of Abstract or Rational Knowledge.\n\nThe outward impression upon the senses, together with the mood which it\nalone awakens in us, vanishes with the presence of the thing. Therefore\nthese two cannot of themselves constitute _experience_ proper, whose\nteaching is to guide our conduct for the future. The image of that\nimpression which the imagination preserves is originally weaker than the\nimpression itself, and becomes weaker and weaker daily, until in time it\ndisappears altogether. There is only one thing which is not subject either\nto the instantaneous vanishing of the impression or to the gradual\ndisappearance of its image, and is therefore free from the power of time.\nThis is the _conception_. In it, then, the teaching of experience must be\nstored up, and it alone is suited to be a safe guide to our steps in life.\nTherefore Seneca says rightly, “_Si vis tibi omnia subjicere, te subjice\nrationi_” (Ep. 37). And I add to this that the essential condition of\nsurpassing others in actual life is that we should reflect or deliberate.\nSuch an important tool of the intellect as the _concept_ evidently cannot\nbe identical with the _word_, this mere sound, which as an impression of\nsense passes with the moment, or as a phantasm of hearing dies away with\ntime. Yet the concept is an idea, the distinct consciousness and\npreservation of which are bound up with the word. Hence the Greeks called\nword, concept, relation, thought, and reason by the name of the first, ὁ\nλογος. Yet the concept is perfectly different both from the word, to which\nit is joined, and from the perceptions, from which it has originated. It\nis of an entirely different nature from these impressions of the senses.\nYet it is able to take up into itself all the results of perception, and\ngive them back again unchanged and undiminished after the longest period\nof time; thus alone does _experience_ arise. But the concept preserves,\nnot what is perceived nor what is then felt, but only what is essential in\nthese, in an entirely altered form, and yet as an adequate representative\nof them. Just as flowers cannot be preserved, but their ethereal oil,\ntheir essence, with the same smell and the same virtues, can be. The\naction that has been guided by correct conceptions will, in the result,\ncoincide with the real object aimed at. We may judge of the inestimable\nvalue of conceptions, and consequently of the reason, if we glance for a\nmoment at the infinite multitude and variety of the things and conditions\nthat coexist and succeed each other, and then consider that speech and\nwriting (the signs of conceptions) are capable of affording us accurate\ninformation as to everything and every relation when and wherever it may\nhave been; for comparatively _few_ conceptions can contain and represent\nan infinite number of things and conditions. In our own reflection\n_abstraction_ is a throwing off of useless baggage for the sake of more\neasily handling the knowledge which is to be compared, and has therefore\nto be turned about in all directions. We allow much that is unessential,\nand therefore only confusing, to fall away from the real things, and work\nwith few but essential determinations thought in the abstract. But just\nbecause general conceptions are only formed by thinking away and leaving\nout existing qualities, and are therefore the emptier the more general\nthey are, the use of this procedure is confined to the _working up_ of\nknowledge which we have already acquired. This working up includes the\ndrawing of conclusions from premisses contained in our knowledge. New\ninsight, on the contrary, can only be obtained by the help of the faculty\nof judgment, from perception, which alone is complete and rich knowledge.\nFurther, because the content and the extent of the concepts stand in\ninverse relation to each other, and thus the more is thought _under_ a\nconcept, the less is thought _in_ it, concepts form a graduated series, a\nhierarchy, from the most special to the most general, at the lower end of\nwhich scholastic realism is almost right, and at the upper end nominalism.\nFor the most special conception is almost the individual, thus almost\nreal; and the most general conception, _e.g._, being (_i.e._, the\ninfinitive of the copula), is scarcely anything but a word. Therefore\nphilosophical systems which confine themselves to such very general\nconceptions, without going down to the real, are little more than mere\njuggling with words. For since all abstraction consists in thinking away,\nthe further we push it the less we have left over. Therefore, if I read\nthose modern philosophemes which move constantly in the widest\nabstractions, I am soon quite unable, in spite of all attention, to think\nalmost anything more in connection with them; for I receive no material\nfor thought, but am supposed to work with mere empty shells, which gives\nme a feeling like that which we experience when we try to throw very light\nbodies; the strength and also the exertion are there, but there is no\nobject to receive them, so as to supply the other moment of motion. If any\none wants to experience this let him read the writings of the disciples of\nSchelling, or still better of the Hegelians. _Simple conceptions_ would\nnecessarily be such as could not be broken up. Accordingly they could\nnever be the subject of an analytical judgment. This I hold to be\nimpossible, for if we think a conception we must also be able to give its\ncontent. What are commonly adduced as examples of simple conceptions are\nreally not conceptions at all, but partly mere sensations—as, for\ninstance, those of some special colour; partly the forms of perception\nwhich are known to us _a priori_, thus properly the ultimate elements of\n_perceptive knowledge_. But this itself is for the whole system of our\nthought what granite is for geology, the ultimate firm basis which\nsupports all, and beyond which we cannot go. The _distinctness_ of a\nconception demands not only that we should be able to separate its\npredicates, but also that we should be able to analyse these even if they\nare abstractions, and so on until we reach knowledge of _perception_, and\nthus refer to concrete things through the distinct perception of which the\nfinal abstractions are verified and reality guaranteed to them, as well as\nto all the higher abstractions which rest upon them. Therefore the\nordinary explanation that the conception is distinct as soon as we can\ngive its predicates is not sufficient. For the separating of these\npredicates may lead perhaps to more conceptions; and so on again without\nthere being that ultimate basis of perceptions which imparts reality to\nall those conceptions. Take, for example, the conception “spirit,” and\nanalyse it into its predicates: “A thinking, willing, immaterial, simple,\nindestructible being that does not occupy space.” Nothing is yet\ndistinctly thought about it, because the elements of these conceptions\ncannot be verified by means of perceptions, for a thinking being without a\nbrain is like a digesting being without a stomach. Only perceptions are,\nproperly speaking, _clear_, not conceptions; these at the most can only be\ndistinct. Hence also, absurd as it was, “clear and confused” were coupled\ntogether and used as synonymous when knowledge of perception was explained\nas merely a confused abstract knowledge, because the latter kind of\nknowledge alone was distinct. This was first done by Duns Scotus, but\nLeibnitz has substantially the same view, upon which his “_Identitas\nIndiscernibilium_” depends. (See Kant’s refutation of this, p. 275 of the\nfirst edition of the Critique of Pure Reason.)\n\nThe close connection of the conception with the word, thus of speech with\nreason, which was touched on above, rests ultimately upon the following\nground. _Time_ is throughout the form of our whole consciousness, with its\ninward and outward apprehension. Conceptions, on the other hand, which\noriginate through abstraction and are perfectly general ideas, different\nfrom all particular things, have in this property indeed a certain measure\nof objective existence, which does not, however, belong to any series of\nevents in time. Therefore in order to enter the immediate present of an\nindividual consciousness, and thus to admit of being introduced into a\nseries of events in time, they must to a certain extent be reduced again\nto the nature of individual things, individualised, and therefore linked\nto an idea of sense. Such an idea is the _word_. It is accordingly the\nsensible sign of the conception, and as such the necessary means of\n_fixing_ it, that is, of presenting it to the consciousness, which is\nbound up with the form of time, and thus establishing a connection between\nthe reason, whose objects are merely general universals, knowing neither\nplace nor time, and consciousness, which is bound up with time, is\nsensuous, and so far purely animal. Only by this means is the reproduction\nat pleasure, thus the recollection and preservation, of conceptions\npossible and open to us; and only by means of this, again, are the\noperations which are undertaken with conceptions possible—judgment,\ninference, comparison, limitation, &c. It is true it sometimes happens\nthat conceptions occupy consciousness without their signs, as when we run\nthrough a train of reasoning so rapidly that we could not think the words\nin the time. But such cases are exceptions, which presuppose great\nexercise of the reason, which it could only have obtained by means of\nlanguage. How much the use of reason is bound up with speech we see in the\ncase of the deaf and dumb, who, if they have learnt no kind of language,\nshow scarcely more intelligence than the ourang-outang or the elephant.\nFor their reason is almost entirely potential, not actual.\n\nWords and speech are thus the indispensable means of distinct thought. But\nas every means, every machine, at once burdens and hinders, so also does\nlanguage; for it forces the fluid and modifiable thoughts, with their\ninfinitely fine distinctions of difference, into certain rigid, permanent\nforms, and thus in fixing also fetters them. This hindrance is to some\nextent got rid of by learning several languages. For in these the thought\nis poured from one mould into another, and somewhat alters its form in\neach, so that it becomes more and more freed from all form and clothing,\nand thus its own proper nature comes more distinctly into consciousness,\nand it recovers again its original capacity for modification. The ancient\nlanguages render this service very much better than the modern, because,\non account of their great difference from the latter, the same thoughts\nare expressed in them in quite another way, and must thus assume a very\ndifferent form; besides which the more perfect grammar of the ancient\nlanguages renders a more artistic and more perfect construction of the\nthoughts and their connection possible. Thus a Greek or a Roman might\nperhaps content himself with his own language, but he who understands\nnothing but some single modern patois will soon betray this poverty in\nwriting and speaking; for his thoughts, firmly bound to such narrow\nstereotyped forms, must appear awkward and monotonous. Genius certainly\nmakes up for this as for everything else, for example in Shakespeare.\n\nBurke, in his “Inquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful,” p. 5, § 4 and 5,\nhas given a perfectly correct and very elaborate exposition of what I laid\ndown in § 9 of the first volume, that the words of a speech are perfectly\nunderstood without calling up ideas of perception, pictures in our heads.\nBut he draws from this the entirely false conclusion that we hear,\napprehend, and make use of words without connecting with them any idea\nwhatever; whereas he ought to have drawn the conclusion that all ideas are\nnot perceptible images, but that precisely those ideas which must be\nexpressed by means of words are abstract notions or conceptions, and these\nfrom their very nature are not perceptible. Just because words impart only\ngeneral conceptions, which are perfectly different from ideas of\nperception, when, for example, an event is recounted all the hearers will\nreceive the same conceptions; but if afterwards they wish to make the\nincident clear to themselves, each of them will call up in his imagination\na different _image_ of it, which differs considerably from the correct\nimage that is possessed only by the eye-witness. This is the primary\nreason (which, however, is accompanied by others) why every fact is\nnecessarily distorted by being repeatedly told. The second recounter\ncommunicates conceptions which he has abstracted from the image of _his\nown_ imagination, and from these conceptions the third now forms another\nimage differing still more widely from the truth, and this again he\ntranslates into conceptions, and so the process goes on. Whoever is\nsufficiently matter of fact to stick to the conceptions imparted to him,\nand repeat them, will prove the most truthful reporter.\n\nThe best and most intelligent exposition of the essence and nature of\nconceptions which I have been able to find is in Thomas Reid’s “Essays on\nthe Powers of Human Mind,” vol. ii., Essay 5, ch. 6. This was afterwards\ncondemned by Dugald Stewart in his “Philosophy of the Human Mind.” Not to\nwaste paper I will only briefly remark with regard to the latter that he\nbelongs to that large class who have obtained an undeserved reputation\nthrough favour and friends, and therefore I can only advise that not an\nhour should be wasted over the scribbling of this shallow writer.\n\nThe princely scholastic Pico de Mirandula already saw that reason is the\nfaculty of abstract ideas, and understanding the faculty of ideas of\nperception. For in his book, “_De Imaginatione_,” ch. 11, he carefully\ndistinguishes understanding and reason, and explains the latter as the\ndiscursive faculty peculiar to man, and the former as the intuitive\nfaculty, allied to the kind of knowledge which is proper to the angels,\nand indeed to God. Spinoza also characterises reason quite correctly as\nthe faculty of framing general conceptions (Eth., ii. prop. 40, schol. 2).\nSuch facts would not need to be mentioned if it were not for the tricks\nthat have been played in the last fifty years by the whole of the\nphilosophasters of Germany with the conception _reason_. For they have\ntried, with shameless audacity, to smuggle in under this name an entirely\nspurious faculty of immediate, metaphysical, so-called super-sensuous\nknowledge. The reason proper, on the other hand, they call\n_understanding_, and the understanding proper, as something quite strange\nto them, they overlook altogether, and ascribe its intuitive functions to\nsensibility.\n\nIn the case of all things in this world new drawbacks or disadvantages\ncleave to every source of aid, to every gain, to every advantage; and thus\nreason also, which gives to man such great advantages over the brutes,\ncarries with it its special disadvantages, and opens for him paths of\nerror into which the brutes can never stray. Through it a new species of\nmotives, to which the brute is not accessible, obtains power over his\nwill. These are the _abstract_ motives, the mere thoughts, which are by no\nmeans always drawn from his own experience, but often come to him only\nthrough the talk and example of others, through tradition and literature.\nHaving become accessible to thought, he is at once exposed to error. But\nevery error must sooner or later do harm, and the greater the error the\ngreater the harm it will do. The individual error must be atoned for by\nhim who cherishes it, and often he has to pay dearly for it. And the same\nthing holds good on a large scale of the common errors of whole nations.\nTherefore it cannot too often be repeated that every error wherever we\nmeet it, is to be pursued and rooted out as an enemy of mankind, and that\nthere can be no such thing as privileged or sanctioned error. The thinker\nought to attack it, even if humanity should cry out with pain, like a sick\nman whose ulcer the physician touches. The brute can never stray far from\nthe path of nature; for its motives lie only in the world of perception,\nwhere only the possible, indeed only the actual, finds room. On the other\nhand, all that is only imaginable, and therefore also the false, the\nimpossible, the absurd, and senseless, enters into abstract conceptions,\ninto thoughts and words. Since now all partake of reason, but few of\njudgment, the consequence is that man is exposed to delusion, for he is\nabandoned to every conceivable chimera which any one talks him into, and\nwhich, acting on his will as a motive, may influence him to perversities\nand follies of every kind, to the most unheard-of extravagances, and also\nto actions most contrary to his animal nature. True culture, in which\nknowledge and judgment go hand in hand, can only be brought to bear on a\nfew; and still fewer are capable of receiving it. For the great mass of\nmen a kind of training everywhere takes its place. It is effected by\nexample, custom, and the very early and firm impression of certain\nconceptions, before any experience, understanding, or judgment were there\nto disturb the work. Thus thoughts are implanted, which afterward cling as\nfirmly, and are as incapable of being shaken by any instruction as if they\nwere _inborn_; and indeed they have often been regarded, even by\nphilosophers, as such. In this way we can, with the same trouble, imbue\nmen with what is right and rational, or with what is most absurd. For\nexample, we can accustom them to approach this or that idol with holy\ndread, and at the mention of its name to prostrate in the dust not only\ntheir bodies but their whole spirit; to sacrifice their property and their\nlives willingly to words, to names, to the defence of the strangest whims;\nto attach arbitrarily the greatest honour or the deepest disgrace to this\nor that, and to prize highly or disdain everything accordingly with full\ninward conviction; to renounce all animal food, as in Hindustan, or to\ndevour still warm and quivering pieces, cut from the living animal, as in\nAbyssinia; to eat men, as in New Zealand, or to sacrifice their children\nto Moloch; to castrate themselves, to fling themselves voluntarily on the\nfuneral piles of the dead—in a word, to do anything we please. Hence the\nCrusades, the extravagances of fanatical sects; hence Chiliasts and\nFlagellants, persecutions, _autos da fe_, and all that is offered by the\nlong register of human perversities. Lest it should be thought that only\nthe dark ages afford such examples, I shall add a couple of more modern\ninstances. In the year 1818 there went from Würtemberg 7000 Chiliasts to\nthe neighbourhood of Ararat, because the new kingdom of God, specially\nannounced by Jung Stilling, was to appear there.(17) Gall relates that in\nhis time a mother killed her child and roasted it in order to cure her\nhusband’s rheumatism with its fat.(18) The tragical side of error lies in\nthe practical, the comical is reserved for the theoretical. For example,\nif we could firmly persuade three men that the sun is not the cause of\ndaylight, we might hope to see it soon established as the general\nconviction. In Germany it was possible to proclaim as the greatest\nphilosopher of all ages Hegel, a repulsive, mindless charlatan, an\nunparalleled scribbler of nonsense, and for twenty years many thousands\nhave believed it stubbornly and firmly; and indeed, outside Germany, the\nDanish Academy entered the lists against myself for his fame, and sought\nto have him regarded as a _summus philosophus_. (Upon this see the \n\nChapter VII.(19) On The Relation of the Concrete Knowledge of Perception\nto Abstract Knowledge.\n\nIt has been shown that conceptions derive their material from knowledge of\nperception, and therefore the entire structure of our world of thought\nrests upon the world of perception. We must therefore be able to go back\nfrom every conception, even if only indirectly through intermediate\nconceptions, to the perceptions from which it is either itself directly\nderived or those conceptions are derived of which it is again an\nabstraction. That is to say, we must be able to support it with\nperceptions which stand to the abstractions in the relation of examples.\nThese perceptions thus afford the real content of all our thought, and\nwhenever they are wanting we have not had conceptions but mere words in\nour heads. In this respect our intellect is like a bank, which, if it is\nto be sound, must have cash in its safe, so as to be able to meet all the\nnotes it has issued, in case of demand; the perceptions are the cash, the\nconceptions are the notes. In this sense the perceptions might very\nappropriately be called _primary_, and the conceptions, on the other hand,\n_secondary_ ideas. Not quite so aptly, the Schoolmen, following the\nexample of Aristotle (_Metaph._, vi. 11, xi. 1), called real things\n_substantiæ primæ_, and the conceptions _substantiæ secundæ_. Books impart\nonly secondary ideas. Mere conceptions of a thing without perception give\nonly a general knowledge of it. We only have a thorough understanding of\nthings and their relations so far as we are able to represent them to\nourselves in pure, distinct perceptions, without the aid of words. To\nexplain words by words, to compare concepts with concepts, in which most\nphilosophising consists, is a trivial shifting about of the\nconcept-spheres in order to see which goes into the other and which does\nnot. At the best we can in this way only arrive at conclusions; but even\nconclusions give no really new knowledge, but only show us all that lay in\nthe knowledge we already possessed, and what part of it perhaps might be\napplicable to the particular case. On the other hand, to perceive, to\nallow the things themselves to speak to us, to apprehend new relations of\nthem, and then to take up and deposit all this in conceptions, in order to\npossess it with certainty—that gives new knowledge. But, while almost\nevery one is capable of comparing conceptions with conceptions, to compare\nconceptions with perceptions is a gift of the select few. It is the\ncondition, according to the degree of its perfection, of wit, judgment,\ningenuity, genius. The former faculty, on the contrary, results in little\nmore than possibly rational reflections. The inmost kernel of all genuine\nand actual knowledge is a perception; and every new truth is the profit or\ngain yielded by a perception. All original thinking takes place in images,\nand this is why imagination is so necessary an instrument of thought, and\nminds that lack imagination will never accomplish much, unless it be in\nmathematics. On the other hand, merely abstract thoughts, which have no\nkernel of perception, are like cloud-structures, without reality. Even\nwriting and speaking, whether didactic or poetical, has for its final aim\nto guide the reader to the same concrete knowledge from which the author\nstarted; if it has not this aim it is bad. This is why the contemplation\nand observing of every real thing, as soon as it presents something new to\nthe observer, is more instructive than any reading or hearing. For indeed,\nif we go to the bottom of the matter, all truth and wisdom, nay, the\nultimate secret of things, is contained in each real object, yet certainly\nonly _in concreto_, just as gold lies hidden in the ore; the difficulty is\nto extract it. From a book, on the contrary, at the best we only receive\nthe truth at second hand, and oftener not at all.\n\nIn most books, putting out of account those that are thoroughly bad, the\nauthor, when their content is not altogether empirical, has certainly\n_thought_ but not _perceived_; he has written from reflection, not from\nintuition, and it is this that makes them commonplace and tedious. For\nwhat the author has thought could always have been thought by the reader\nalso, if he had taken the same trouble; indeed it consists simply of\nintelligent thought, full exposition of what is _implicite_ contained in\nthe theme. But no actually new knowledge comes in this way into the world;\nthis is only created in the moment of perception, of direct comprehension\nof a new side of the thing. When, therefore, on the contrary, _sight_ has\nformed the foundation of an author’s thought, it is as if he wrote from a\nland where the reader has never been, for all is fresh and new, because it\nis drawn directly from the original source of all knowledge. Let me\nillustrate the distinction here touched upon by a perfectly easy and\nsimple example. Any commonplace writer might easily describe profound\ncontemplation or petrifying astonishment by saying: “He stood like a\nstatue;” but Cervantes says: “Like a clothed statue, for the wind moved\nhis garments” (_Don Quixote_, book vi. ch. 19). It is thus that all great\nminds have ever _thought in presence of the perception_, and kept their\ngaze steadfastly upon it in their thought. We recognise this from this\nfact, among others, that even the most opposite of them so often agree and\ncoincide in some particular; because they all speak of the same thing\nwhich they all had before their eyes, the world, the perceived reality;\nindeed in a certain degree they all say the same thing, and others never\nbelieve them. We recognise it further in the appropriateness and\noriginality of the expression, which is always perfectly adapted to the\nsubject because it has been inspired by perception, in the naivete of the\nlanguage, the freshness of the imagery, and the impressiveness of the\nsimiles, all of which qualities, without exception, distinguish the works\nof great minds, and, on the contrary, are always wanting in the works of\nothers. Accordingly only commonplace forms of expression and trite figures\nare at the service of the latter, and they never dare to allow themselves\nto be natural, under penalty of displaying their vulgarity in all its\ndreary barrenness; instead of this they are affected mannerists. Hence\nBuffon says: “_Le style est l’homme même_.” If men of commonplace mind\nwrite poetry they have certain traditional conventional opinions,\npassions, noble sentiments, &c., which they have received in the abstract,\nand attribute to the heroes of their poems, who are in this way reduced to\nmere personifications of those opinions, and are thus themselves to a\ncertain extent abstractions, and therefore insipid and tiresome. If they\nphilosophise, they have taken in a few wide abstract conceptions, which\nthey turn about in all directions, as if they had to do with algebraical\nequations, and hope that something will come of it; at the most we see\nthat they have all read the same things. Such a tossing to and fro of\nabstract conceptions, after the manner of algebraical equations, which is\nnow-a-days called dialectic, does not, like real algebra, afford certain\nresults; for here the conception which is represented by the word is not a\nfixed and perfectly definite quality, such as are symbolised by the\nletters in algebra, but is wavering and ambiguous, and capable of\nextension and contraction. Strictly speaking, all thinking, _i.e._,\ncombining of abstract conceptions, has at the most the _recollections_ of\nearlier perceptions for its material, and this only indirectly, so far as\nit constitutes the foundation of all conceptions. Real knowledge, on the\ncontrary, that is, immediate knowledge, is perception alone, new, fresh\nperception itself. Now the concepts which the reason has framed and the\nmemory has preserved cannot all be present to consciousness at once, but\nonly a very small number of them at a time. On the other hand, the energy\nwith which we apprehend what is present in perception, in which really all\nthat is essential in all things generally is virtually contained and\nrepresented, is apprehended, fills the consciousness in one moment with\nits whole power. Upon this depends the infinite superiority of genius to\nlearning; they stand to each other as the text of an ancient classic to\nits commentary. All truth and all wisdom really lies ultimately in\nperception. But this unfortunately can neither be retained nor\ncommunicated. The _objective_ conditions of such communication can\ncertainly be presented to others purified and illustrated through plastic\nand pictorial art, and even much more directly through poetry; but it\ndepends so much upon _subjective_ conditions, which are not at the command\nof every one, and of no one at all times, nay, indeed in the higher\ndegrees of perfection, are only the gift of the favoured few. Only the\nworst knowledge, abstract, secondary knowledge, the conception, the mere\nshadow of true knowledge, is unconditionally communicable. If perceptions\nwere communicable, that would be a communication worth the trouble; but at\nlast every one must remain in his own skin and skull, and no one can help\nanother. To enrich the conception from perception is the unceasing\nendeavour of poetry and philosophy. However, the aims of man are\nessentially _practical_; and for these it is sufficient that what he has\napprehended through perception should leave traces in him, by virtue of\nwhich he will recognise it in the next similar case; thus he becomes\npossessed of worldly wisdom. Thus, as a rule, the man of the world cannot\nteach his accumulated truth and wisdom, but only make use of it; he\nrightly comprehends each event as it happens, and determines what is in\nconformity with it. That books will not take the place of experience nor\nlearning of genius are two kindred phenomena. Their common ground is that\nthe abstract can never take the place of the concrete. Books therefore do\nnot take the place of experience, because _conceptions_ always remain\n_general_, and consequently do not get down to the particular, which,\nhowever, is just what has to be dealt with in life; and, besides this, all\nconceptions are abstracted from what is particular and perceived in\nexperience, and therefore one must have come to know these in order\nadequately to understand even the general conceptions which the books\ncommunicate. Learning cannot take the place of genius, because it also\naffords merely conceptions, but the knowledge of genius consists in the\napprehension of the (Platonic) Ideas of things, and therefore is\nessentially intuitive. Thus in the first of these phenomena the\n_objective_ condition of perceptive or intuitive knowledge is wanting; in\nthe second the _subjective_; the former may be attained, the latter\ncannot.\n\nWisdom and genius, these two summits of the Parnassus of human knowledge,\nhave their foundation not in the abstract and discursive, but in the\nperceptive faculty. Wisdom proper is something intuitive, not something\nabstract. It does not consist in principles and thoughts, which one can\ncarry about ready in his mind, as results of his own research or that of\nothers; but it is the whole manner in which the world presents itself in\nhis mind. This varies so much that on account of it the wise man lives in\nanother world from the fool, and the genius sees another world from the\nblockhead. That the works of the man of genius immeasurably surpass those\nof all others arises simply from the fact that the world which he sees,\nand from which he takes his utterances, is so much clearer, as it were\nmore profoundly worked out, than that in the minds of others, which\ncertainly contains the same objects, but is to the world of the man of\ngenius as the Chinese picture without shading and perspective is to the\nfinished oil-painting. The material is in all minds the same; but the\ndifference lies in the perfection of the form which it assumes in each,\nupon which the numerous grades of intelligence ultimately depend. These\ngrades thus exist in the root, in the _perceptive_ or _intuitive_\napprehension, and do not first appear in the abstract. Hence original\nmental superiority shows itself so easily when the occasion arises, and is\nat once felt and hated by others.\n\nIn practical life the intuitive knowledge of the understanding is able to\nguide our action and behaviour directly, while the abstract knowledge of\nthe reason can only do so by means of the memory. Hence arises the\nsuperiority of intuitive knowledge in all cases which admit of no time for\nreflection; thus for daily intercourse, in which, just on this account,\nwomen excel. Only those who intuitively know the nature of men as they are\nas a rule, and thus comprehend the individuality of the person before\nthem, will understand how to manage him with certainty and rightly.\nAnother may know by heart all the three hundred maxims of Gracian, but\nthis will not save him from stupid mistakes and misconceptions if he lacks\nthat intuitive knowledge. For all _abstract knowledge_ affords us\nprimarily mere general principles and rules; but the particular case is\nalmost never to be carried out exactly according to the rule; then the\nrule itself has to be presented to us at the right time by the memory,\nwhich seldom punctually happens; then the _propositio minor_ has to be\nformed out of the present case, and finally the conclusion drawn. Before\nall this is done the opportunity has generally turned its back upon us,\nand then those excellent principles and rules serve at the most to enable\nus to measure the magnitude of the error we have committed. Certainly with\ntime we gain in this way experience and practice, which slowly grows to\nknowledge of the world, and thus, in connection with this, the abstract\nrules may certainly become fruitful. On the other hand, the _intuitive\nknowledge_, which always apprehends only the particular, stands in\nimmediate relation to the present case. Rule, case, and application are\nfor it one, and action follows immediately upon it. This explains why in\nreal life the scholar, whose pre-eminence lies in the province of abstract\nknowledge, is so far surpassed by the man of the world, whose pre-eminence\nconsists in perfect intuitive knowledge, which original disposition\nconferred on him, and a rich experience has developed. The two kinds of\nknowledge always stand to each other in the relation of paper money and\nhard cash; and as there are many cases and circumstances in which the\nformer is to be preferred to the latter, so there are also things and\nsituations for which abstract knowledge is more useful than intuitive. If,\nfor example, it is a conception that in some case guides our action, when\nit is once grasped it has the advantage of being unalterable, and\ntherefore under its guidance we go to work with perfect certainty and\nconsistency. But this certainty which the conception confers on the\nsubjective side is outweighed by the uncertainty which accompanies it on\nthe objective side. The whole conception may be false and groundless, or\nthe object to be dealt with may not come under it, for it may be either\nnot at all or not altogether of the kind which belongs to it. Now if in\nthe particular case we suddenly become conscious of something of this\nsort, we are put out altogether; if we do not become conscious of it, the\nresult brings it to light. Therefore Vauvenargue says: “_Personne n’est\nsujet à plus de fautes, que ceux qui n’agissent que par réflexion_.” If,\non the contrary, it is direct perception of the objects to be dealt with\nand their relations that guides our action, we easily hesitate at every\nstep, for the perception is always modifiable, is ambiguous, has\ninexhaustible details in itself, and shows many sides in succession; we\nact therefore without full confidence. But the subjective uncertainty is\ncompensated by the objective certainty, for here there is no conception\nbetween the object and us, we never lose sight of it; if therefore we only\nsee correctly what we have before us and what we do, we shall hit the\nmark. Our action then is perfectly sure only when it is guided by a\nconception the right ground of which, its completeness, and applicability\nto the given cause is perfectly certain. Action in accordance with\nconceptions may pass into pedantry, action in accordance with the\nperceived impression into levity and folly.\n\n_Perception_ is not only the _source_ of all knowledge, but is itself\nknowledge κατ᾽ εξοχην, is the only unconditionally true, genuine knowledge\ncompletely worthy of the name. For it alone imparts _insight_ properly so\ncalled, it alone is actually assimilated by man, passes into his nature,\nand can with full reason be called _his_; while the conceptions merely\ncling to him. In the fourth book we see indeed that true virtue proceeds\nfrom knowledge of perception or intuitive knowledge; for only those\nactions which are directly called forth by this, and therefore are\nperformed purely from the impulse of our own nature, are properly symptoms\nof our true and unalterable character; not so those which, resulting from\nreflection and its dogmas, are often extorted from the character, and\ntherefore have no unalterable ground in us. But _wisdom_ also, the true\nview of life, the correct eye, and the searching judgment, proceeds from\nthe way in which the man apprehends the perceptible world, but not from\nhis mere abstract knowledge, _i.e._, not from abstract conceptions. The\nbasis or ultimate content of every science consists, not in proofs, nor in\nwhat is proved, but in the unproved foundation of the proofs, which can\nfinally be apprehended only through perception. So also the basis of the\ntrue wisdom and real insight of each man does not consist in conceptions\nand in abstract rational knowledge, but in what is perceived, and in the\ndegree of acuteness, accuracy, and profundity with which he has\napprehended it. He who excels here knows the (Platonic) Ideas of the world\nand life; every case he has seen represents for him innumerable cases; he\nalways apprehends each being according to its true nature, and his action,\nlike his judgment, corresponds to his insight. By degrees also his\ncountenance assumes the expression of penetration, of true intelligence,\nand, if it goes far enough, of wisdom. For it is pre-eminence in knowledge\nof perception alone that stamps its impression upon the features also;\nwhile pre-eminence in abstract knowledge cannot do this. In accordance\nwith what has been said, we find in all classes men of intellectual\nsuperiority, and often quite without learning. Natural understanding can\ntake the place of almost every degree of culture, but no culture can take\nthe place of natural understanding. The scholar has the advantage of such\nmen in the possession of a wealth of cases and facts (historical\nknowledge) and of causal determinations (natural science), all in\nwell-ordered connection, easily surveyed; but yet with all this he has not\na more accurate and profound insight into what is truly essential in all\nthese cases, facts, and causations. The unlearned man of acuteness and\npenetration knows how to dispense with this wealth; we can make use of\nmuch; we can do with little. One case in his own experience teaches him\nmore than many a scholar is taught by a thousand cases which he _knows_,\nbut does not, properly speaking, _understand_. For the little knowledge of\nthat unlearned man is living, because every fact that is known to him is\nsupported by accurate and well-apprehended perception, and thus represents\nfor him a thousand similar facts. On the contrary, the much knowledge of\nthe ordinary scholar is _dead_, because even if it does not consist, as is\noften the case, in mere words, it consists entirely in abstract knowledge.\nThis, however, receives its value only through the _perceptive_ knowledge\nof the individual with which it must connect itself, and which must\nultimately realise all the conceptions. If now this perceptive knowledge\nis very scanty, such a mind is like a bank with liabilities tenfold in\nexcess of its cash reserve, whereby in the end it becomes bankrupt.\nTherefore, while the right apprehension of the perceptible world has\nimpressed the stamp of insight and wisdom on the brow of many an unlearned\nman, the face of many a scholar bears no other trace of his much study\nthan that of exhaustion and weariness from excessive and forced straining\nof the memory in the unnatural accumulation of dead conceptions. Moreover,\nthe insight of such a man is often so puerile, so weak and silly, that we\nmust suppose that the excessive strain upon the faculty of indirect\nknowledge, which is concerned with abstractions, directly weakens the\npower of immediate perceptive knowledge, and the natural and clear vision\nis more and more blinded by the light of books. At any rate the constant\nstreaming in of the thoughts of others must confine and suppress our own,\nand indeed in the long run paralyse the power of thought if it has not\nthat high degree of elasticity which is able to withstand that unnatural\nstream. Therefore ceaseless reading and study directly injures the\nmind—the more so that completeness and constant connection of the system\nof our own thought and knowledge must pay the penalty if we so often\narbitrarily interrupt it in order to gain room for a line of thought\nentirely strange to us. To banish my own thought in order to make room for\nthat of a book would seem to me like what Shakespeare censures in the\ntourists of his time, that they sold their own land to see that of others.\nYet the inclination for reading of most scholars is a kind of _fuga\nvacui_, from the poverty of their own minds, which forcibly draws in the\nthoughts of others. In order to have thoughts they must read something;\njust as lifeless bodies are only moved from without; while the man who\nthinks for himself is like a living body that moves of itself. Indeed it\nis dangerous to read about a subject before we have thought about it\nourselves. For along with the new material the old point of view and\ntreatment of it creeps into the mind, all the more so as laziness and\napathy counsel us to accept what has already been thought, and allow it to\npass for truth. This now insinuates itself, and henceforward our thought\non the subject always takes the accustomed path, like brooks that are\nguided by ditches; to find a thought of our own, a new thought, is then\ndoubly difficult. This contributes much to the want of originality on the\npart of scholars. Add to this that they suppose that, like other people,\nthey must divide their time between pleasure and work. Now they regard\nreading as their work and special calling, and therefore they gorge\nthemselves with it, beyond what they can digest. Then reading no longer\nplays the part of the mere initiator of thought, but takes its place\naltogether; for they think of the subject just as long as they are reading\nabout it, thus with the mind of another, not with their own. But when the\nbook is laid aside entirely different things make much more lively claims\nupon their interest; their private affairs, and then the theatre,\ncard-playing, skittles, the news of the day, and gossip. The man of\nthought is so because such things have no interest for him. He is\ninterested only in his problems, with which therefore he is always\noccupied, by himself and without a book. To give ourselves this interest,\nif we have not got it, is impossible. This is the crucial point. And upon\nthis also depends the fact that the former always speak only of what they\nhave read, while the latter, on the contrary, speaks of what he has\nthought, and that they are, as Pope says:\n\n    “For ever reading, never to be read.”\n\nThe mind is naturally free, not a slave; only what it does willingly, of\nits own accord, succeeds. On the other hand, the compulsory exertion of a\nmind in studies for which it is not qualified, or when it has become\ntired, or in general too continuously and _invita Minerva_, dulls the\nbrain, just as reading by moonlight dulls the eyes. This is especially the\ncase with the straining of the immature brain in the earlier years of\nchildhood. I believe that the learning of Latin and Greek grammar from the\nsixth to the twelfth year lays the foundation of the subsequent stupidity\nof most scholars. At any rate the mind requires the nourishment of\nmaterials from without. All that we eat is not at once incorporated in the\norganism, but only so much of it as is digested; so that only a small part\nof it is assimilated, and the remainder passes away; and thus to eat more\nthan we can assimilate is useless and injurious. It is precisely the same\nwith what we read. Only so far as it gives food for thought does it\nincrease our insight and true knowledge. Therefore Heracleitus says:\n“πολυμαθια νουν ου διδασκει” (_multiscitia non dat intellectum_). It\nseems, however, to me that learning may be compared to a heavy suit of\narmour, which certainly makes the strong man quite invincible, but to the\nweak man is a burden under which he sinks altogether.\n\nThe exposition given in our third book of the knowledge of the (Platonic)\nIdeas, as the highest attainable by man, and at the same time entirely\n_perceptive or intuitive_ knowledge, is a proof that the source of true\nwisdom does not lie in abstract rational knowledge, but in the clear and\nprofound apprehension of the world in perception. Therefore wise men may\nlive in any age, and those of the past remain wise men for all succeeding\ngenerations. Learning, on the contrary, is relative; the learned men of\nthe past are for the most part children as compared with us, and require\nindulgence.\n\nBut to him who studies in order to gain _insight_ books and studies are\nonly steps of the ladder by which he climbs to the summit of knowledge. As\nsoon as a round of the ladder has raised him a step, he leaves it behind\nhim. The many, on the other hand, who study in order to fill their memory\ndo not use the rounds of the ladder to mount by, but take them off, and\nload themselves with them to carry them away, rejoicing at the increasing\nweight of the burden. They remain always below, because they bear what\nought to have borne them.\n\nUpon the truth set forth here, that the kernel of all knowledge is the\n_perceptive or intuitive_ apprehension, depends the true and profound\nremark of Helvetius, that the really characteristic and original views of\nwhich a gifted individual is capable, and the working up, development, and\nmanifold application of which is the material of all his works, even if\nwritten much later, can arise in him only up to the thirty-fifth or at the\nlatest the fortieth year of his life, and are really the result of\ncombinations he has made in his early youth. For they are not mere\nconnections of abstract conceptions, but his own intuitive comprehension\nof the objective world and the nature of things. Now, that this intuitive\napprehension must have completed its work by the age mentioned above\ndepends partly on the fact that by that time the ectypes of all (Platonic)\nIdeas must have presented themselves to the man, and therefore cannot\nappear later with the strength of the first impression; partly on this,\nthat the highest energy of brain activity is demanded for this\nquintessence of all knowledge, for this proof before the letter of the\napprehension, and this highest energy of the brain is dependent on the\nfreshness and flexibility of its fibres and the rapidity with which the\narterial blood flows to the brain. But this again is at its strongest only\nas long as the arterial system has a decided predominance over the venous\nsystem, which begins to decline after the thirtieth year, until at last,\nafter the forty-second year, the venous system obtains the upper hand, as\nCabanis has admirably and instructively explained. Therefore the years\nbetween twenty and thirty and the first few years after thirty are for the\nintellect what May is for the trees; only then do the blossoms appear of\nwhich all the later fruits are the development. The world of perception\nhas made its impression, and thereby laid the foundation of all the\nsubsequent thoughts of the individual. He may by reflection make clearer\nwhat he has apprehended; he may yet acquire much knowledge as nourishment\nfor the fruit which has once set; he may extend his views, correct his\nconceptions and judgments, it may be only through endless combinations\nthat he becomes completely master of the materials he has gained; indeed\nhe will generally produce his best works much later, as the greatest heat\nbegins with the decline of the day, but he can no longer hope for new\noriginal knowledge from the one living fountain of perception. It is this\nthat Byron feels when he breaks forth into his wonderfully beautiful\nlament:\n\n    “No more—no more—oh! never more on me\n      The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,\n    Which out of all the lovely things we see\n      Extracts emotions beautiful and new,\n    Hived in our bosoms like the bag o’ the bee:\n      Think’st thou the honey with those objects grew?\n    Alas! ’twas not in them, but in thy power\n      To double even the sweetness of a flower.”\n\nThrough all that I have said hitherto I hope I have placed in a clear\nlight the important truth that since all abstract knowledge springs from\nknowledge of perception, it obtains its whole value from its relation to\nthe latter, thus from the fact that its conceptions, or the abstractions\nwhich they denote, can be realised, _i.e._, proved, through perceptions;\nand, moreover, that most depends upon the quality of these perceptions.\nConceptions and abstractions which do not ultimately refer to perceptions\nare like paths in the wood that end without leading out of it. The great\nvalue of conceptions lies in the fact that by means of them the original\nmaterial of knowledge is more easily handled, surveyed, and arranged. But\nalthough many kinds of logical and dialectical operations are possible\nwith them, yet no entirely original and new knowledge will result from\nthese; that is to say, no knowledge whose material neither lay already in\nperception nor was drawn from self-consciousness. This is the true meaning\nof the doctrine attributed to Aristotle: _Nihil est in intellectu, nisi\nquod antea fuerit in sensu_. It is also the meaning of the Lockeian\nphilosophy, which made for ever an epoch in philosophy, because it\ncommenced at last the serious discussion of the question as to the origin\nof our knowledge. It is also principally what the “Critique of Pure\nReason” teaches. It also desires that we should not remain at the\n_conceptions_, but go back to their _source_, thus to _perception_; only\nwith the true and important addition that what holds good of the\nperception also extends to its subjective conditions, thus to the forms\nwhich lie predisposed in the perceiving and thinking brain as its natural\nfunctions; although these at least _virtualiter_ precede the actual\nsense-perception, _i.e._, are _a priori_, and therefore do not depend upon\nsense-perception, but it upon them. For these forms themselves have indeed\nno other end, nor service, than to produce the empirical perception on the\nnerves of sense being excited, as other forms are determined afterwards to\nconstruct thoughts in the abstract from the material of perception. The\n“Critique of Pure Reason” is therefore related to the Lockeian philosophy\nas the analysis of the infinite to elementary geometry, but is yet\nthroughout to be regarded as the _continuation of the Lockeian\nphilosophy_. The given material of every philosophy is accordingly nothing\nelse than the _empirical consciousness_, which divides itself into the\nconsciousness of one’s own self (self-consciousness) and the consciousness\nof other things (external perception). For this alone is what is\nimmediately and actually given. Every philosophy which, instead of\nstarting from this, takes for its starting-point arbitrarily chosen\nabstract conceptions, such as, for example, absolute, absolute substance,\nGod, infinity, finitude, absolute identity, being, essence, &c., &c.,\nmoves in the air without support, and can therefore never lead to a real\nresult. Yet in all ages philosophers have attempted it with such\nmaterials; and hence even Kant sometimes, according to the common usage,\nand more from custom than consistency, defines philosophy as a science of\nmere conceptions. But such a science would really undertake to extract\nfrom the partial ideas (for that is what the abstractions are) what is not\nto be found in the complete ideas (the perceptions), from which the former\nwere drawn by abstraction. The possibility of the syllogism leads to this\nmistake, because here the combination of the judgments gives a new result,\nalthough more apparent than real, for the syllogism only brings out what\nalready lay in the given judgments; for it is true the conclusion cannot\ncontain more than the premisses. Conceptions are certainly the material of\nphilosophy, but only as marble is the material of the sculptor. It is not\nto work _out of_ them but _in_ them; that is to say, it is to deposit its\nresults in them, but not to start from them as what is given. Whoever\nwishes to see a glaring example of such a false procedure from mere\nconceptions may look at the “_Institutio Theologica_” of Proclus in order\nto convince himself of the vanity of that whole method. There abstractions\nsuch as “ἑν, πληθος, αγαθον, παραγον και παραγομενον, αυταρκες, αιτιον,\nκρειττον, κινητον, ακινητον, κινουμενον” (_unum_, _multa_, _bonum_,\n_producens et productum_, _sibi sufficiens_, _causa_, _melius_, _mobile_,\n_immobile_, _motum_), &c., are indiscriminately collected, but the\nperceptions to which alone they owe their origin and content ignored and\ncontemptuously disregarded. A theology is then constructed from these\nconceptions, but its goal, the θεος, is kept concealed; thus the whole\nprocedure is apparently unprejudiced, as if the reader did not know at the\nfirst page, just as well as the author, what it is all to end in. I have\nalready quoted a fragment of this above. This production of Proclus is\nreally quite peculiarly adapted to make clear how utterly useless and\nillusory such combinations of abstract conceptions are, for we can make of\nthem whatever we will, especially if we further take advantage of the\nambiguity of many words, such, for example, as κρειττον. If such an\narchitect of conceptions were present in person we would only have to ask\nnaively where all the things are of which he has so much to tell us, and\nwhence he knows the laws from which he draws his conclusions concerning\nthem. He would then soon be obliged to turn to empirical perception, in\nwhich alone the real world exhibits itself, from which those conceptions\nare drawn. Then we would only have to ask further why he did not honestly\nstart from the given perception of such a world, so that at every step his\nassertions could be proved by it, instead of operating with conceptions,\nwhich are yet drawn from perception alone, and therefore can have no\nfurther validity than that which it imparts to them. But of course this is\njust his trick. Through such conceptions, in which, by virtue of\nabstraction, what is inseparable is thought as separate, and what cannot\nbe united as united, he goes far beyond the perception which was their\nsource, and thus beyond the limits of their applicability, to an entirely\ndifferent world from that which supplied the material for building, but\njust on this account to a world of chimeras. I have here referred to\nProclus because in him this procedure becomes specially clear through the\nfrank audacity with which he carries it out. But in Plato also we find\nsome examples of this kind, though not so glaring; and in general the\nphilosophical literature of all ages affords a multitude of instances of\nthe same thing. That of our own time is rich in them. Consider, for\nexample, the writings of the school of Schelling, and observe the\nconstructions that are built up out of abstractions like finite and\ninfinite—being, non-being, other being—activity, hindrance,\nproduct—determining, being determined, determinateness—limit, limiting,\nbeing limited—unity, plurality, multiplicity—identity, diversity,\nindifference—thinking, being, essence, &c. Not only does all that has been\nsaid above hold good of constructions out of such materials, but because\nan infinite amount can be thought _through_ such wide abstractions, only\nvery little indeed can be thought _in_ them; they are empty husks. But\nthus the matter of the whole philosophising becomes astonishingly trifling\nand paltry, and hence arises that unutterable and excruciating tediousness\nwhich is characteristic of all such writings. If indeed I now chose to\ncall to mind the way in which Hegel and his companions have abused such\nwide and empty abstractions, I should have to fear that both the reader\nand I myself would be ill; for the most nauseous tediousness hangs over\nthe empty word-juggling of this loathsome philophaster.\n\nThat in _practical_ philosophy also no wisdom is brought to light from\nmere abstract conceptions is the one thing to be learnt from the ethical\ndissertations of the theologian Schleiermacher, with the delivery of which\nhe has wearied the Berlin Academy for a number of years, and which are\nshortly to appear in a collected form. In them only abstract conceptions,\nsuch as duty, virtue, highest good, moral law, &c., are taken as the\nstarting-point, without further introduction than that they commonly occur\nin ethical systems, and are now treated as given realities. He then\ndiscusses these from all sides with great subtilty, but, on the other\nhand, never makes for the source of these conceptions, for the thing\nitself, the actual human life, to which alone they are related, from which\nthey ought to be drawn, and with which morality has, properly speaking, to\ndo. On this account these diatribes are just as unfruitful and useless as\nthey are tedious, which is saying a great deal. At all times we find\npersons, like this theologian, who is too fond of philosophising, famous\nwhile they are alive, afterwards soon forgotten. My advice is rather to\nread those whose fate has been the opposite of this, for time is short and\nvaluable.\n\nNow although, in accordance with all that has been said, wide, abstract\nconceptions, which can be realised in no perception, must never be the\nsource of knowledge, the starting-point or the proper material of\nphilosophy, yet sometimes particular results of philosophy are such as can\nonly be thought in the abstract, and cannot be proved by any perception.\nKnowledge of this kind will certainly only be half knowledge; it will, as\nit were, only point out the place where what is to be known lies; but this\nremains concealed. Therefore we should only be satisfied with such\nconceptions in the most extreme case, and when we have reached the limit\nof the knowledge possible to our faculties. An example of this might\nperhaps be the conception of a being out of time; such as the proposition:\nthe indestructibility of our true being by death is not a continued\nexistence of it. With conceptions of this sort the firm ground which\nsupports our whole knowledge, the perceptible, seems to waver. Therefore\nphilosophy may certainly at times, and in case of necessity, extend to\nsuch knowledge, but it must never begin with it.\n\nThe working with wide abstractions, which is condemned above, to the\nentire neglect of the perceptive knowledge from which they are drawn, and\nwhich is therefore their permanent and natural controller, was at all\ntimes the principal source of the errors of dogmatic philosophy. A science\nconstructed from the mere comparison of conceptions, that is, from general\nprinciples, could only be certain if all its principles were synthetical\n_a priori_, as is the case in mathematics: for only such admit of no\nexceptions. If, on the other hand, the principles have any empirical\ncontent, we must keep this constantly at hand, to control the general\nprinciples. For no truths which are in any way drawn from experience are\never unconditionally true. They have therefore only an approximately\nuniversal validity; for here there is no rule without an exception. If now\nI link these principles together by means of the intersection of their\nconcept-spheres, one conception might very easily touch the other\nprecisely where the exception lies. But if this happens even only once in\nthe course of a long train of reasoning, the whole structure is loosed\nfrom its foundation and moves in the air. If, for example, I say, “The\nruminants have no front incisors,” and apply this and what follows from it\nto the camel, it all becomes false, for it only holds good of horned\nruminants. What Kant calls _das Vernünfteln_, mere abstract reasoning, and\nso often condemns, is just of this sort. For it consists simply in\nsubsuming conceptions under conceptions, without reference to their\norigin, and without proof of the correctness and exclusiveness of such\nsubsumption—a method whereby we can arrive by longer or shorter circuits\nat almost any result we choose to set before us as our goal. Hence this\nmere abstract reasoning differs only in degree from sophistication\nstrictly so called. But sophistication is in the theoretical sphere\nexactly what chicanery is in the practical. Yet even Plato himself has\nvery frequently permitted such mere abstract reasoning; and Proclus, as we\nhave already mentioned, has, after the manner of all imitators, carried\nthis fault of his model much further. Dionysius the Areopagite, “_De\nDivinis Nominibus_,” is also strongly affected with this. But even in the\nfragments of the Eleatic Melissus we already find distinct examples of\nsuch mere abstract reasoning (especially § 2-5 in Brandis’ _Comment.\nEleat._) His procedure with the conceptions, which never touch the reality\nfrom which they have their content, but, moving in the atmosphere of\nabstract universality, pass away beyond it, resembles blows which never\nhit the mark. A good pattern of such mere abstract reasoning is the “_De\nDiis et Mundo_” of the philosopher Sallustius Büchelchen; especially\nchaps. 7, 12, and 17. But a perfect gem of philosophical mere abstract\nreasoning passing into decided sophistication is the following reasoning\nof the Platonist, Maximus of Tyre, which I shall quote, as it is short:\n“Every injustice is the taking away of a good. There is no other good than\nvirtue: but virtue cannot be taken away: thus it is not possible that the\nvirtuous can suffer injustice from the wicked. It now remains either that\nno injustice can be suffered, or that it is suffered by the wicked from\nthe wicked. But the wicked man possesses no good at all, for only virtue\nis a good; therefore none can be taken from him. Thus he also can suffer\nno injustice. Thus injustice is an impossible thing.” The original, which\nis less concise through repetitions, runs thus: “Αδικια εστι αφαιρεσις\nαγαθου; το δε αγαθον τι αν ειη αλλο η αρετη?—ἡ δε αρετη αναφαιρετον. Ουκ\nαδικησεται τοινυν ὁ την αρετην εχων, η ουκ εστιν αδικια αφαιρεσις αγαθου;\nουδεν γαρ αγαθον αφαιρετον, ουδ᾽ χαποβλητον, ουδ ἑλετον, ουδε ληιστον.\nΕιεν ουν, ουδ᾽ αδικειται ὁ χρηστος, ουδ ὑπο του μοχθηρου; αναφαιρετος γαρ.\nΛειπεται τοινυν η μηδενα αδικεισθαι καθαπαξ, η τον μοχθηρον ὑπο του\nὁμοιου; αλλα τῳ μοχθηρῳ ουδενος μετεστιν αγαθου; ἡ δε αδικια ην αγαθου\nαφαιρεσις; ὁ δε μη εχων ὁ, τι αφαιρεσθη, ουδε εις ὁ, τι αδικησθη, εχει”\n(_Sermo 2_). I shall add further a modern example of such proofs from\nabstract conceptions, by means of which an obviously absurd proposition is\nset up as the truth, and I shall take it from the works of a great man,\nGiordano Bruno. In his book, “_Del Infinito Universo e Mondi_” (p. 87 of\nthe edition of A. Wagner), he makes an Aristotelian prove (with the\nassistance and exaggeration of the passage of Aristotle’s _De Cœlo_, i. 5)\nthat there can be _no space_ beyond the world. The world is enclosed by\nthe eight spheres of Aristotle, and beyond these there can be no space.\nFor if beyond these there were still a body, it must either be simple or\ncompound. It is now proved sophistically, from principles which are\nobviously begged, that no _simple_ body could be there; and therefore,\nalso, no compound body, for it would necessarily be composed of simple\nones. Thus in general there can be no body there—but if not, then _no\nspace_. For space is defined as “that in which bodies can be;” and it has\njust been proved that no body can be there. Thus there is also there no\nspace. This last is the final stroke of this proof from abstract\nconceptions. It ultimately rests on the fact that the proposition, “Where\nno space is, there can be no body” is taken as a universal negative, and\ntherefore converted simply, “Where no body can be there is no space.” But\nthe former proposition, when properly regarded, is a universal\naffirmative: “Everything that has no space has no body,” thus it must not\nbe converted simply. Yet it is not every proof from abstract conceptions,\nwith a conclusion which clearly contradicts perception (as here the\nfiniteness of space), that can thus be referred to a logical error. For\nthe sophistry does not always lie in the form, but often in the matter, in\nthe premisses, and in the indefiniteness of the conceptions and their\nextension. We find numerous examples of this in Spinoza, whose method\nindeed it is to prove from conceptions. See, for example, the miserable\nsophisms in his “Ethics,” P. iv., prop. 29-31, by means of the ambiguity\nof the uncertain conceptions _convenire_ and _commune habere_. Yet this\ndoes not prevent the neo-Spinozists of our own day from taking all that he\nhas said for gospel. Of these the Hegelians, of whom there are actually\nstill a few, are specially amusing on account of their traditional\nreverence for his principle, _omnis determinatio est negatio_, at which,\naccording to the charlatan spirit of the school, they put on a face as if\nit was able to unhinge the world; whereas it is of no use at all, for even\nthe simplest can see for himself that if I limit anything by\ndeterminations, I thereby exclude and thus negate what lies beyond these\nlimits.\n\nThus in all mere reasonings of the above kind it becomes very apparent\nwhat errors that algebra with mere conceptions, uncontrolled by\nperception, is exposed to, and that therefore perception is for our\nintellect what the firm ground upon which it stands is for our body: if we\nforsake perception everything is _instabilis tellus, innabilis unda_. The\nreader will pardon the fulness of these expositions and examples on\naccount of their instructiveness. I have sought by means of them to bring\nforward and support the difference, indeed the opposition, between\nperceptive and abstract or reflected knowledge, which has hitherto been\ntoo little regarded, and the establishment of which is a fundamental\ncharacteristic of my philosophy. For many phenomena of our mental life are\nonly explicable through this distinction. The connecting link between\nthese two such different kinds of knowledge is the _faculty of judgment_,\nas I have shown in § 14 of the first volume. This faculty is certainly\nalso active in the province of mere abstract knowledge, in which it\ncompares conceptions only with conceptions; therefore every judgment, in\nthe logical sense of the word, is certainly a work of the faculty of\njudgment, for it always consists in the subsumption of a narrower\nconception under a wider one. Yet this activity of the faculty of\njudgment, in which it merely compares conceptions with each other, is a\nsimpler and easier task than when it makes the transition from what is\nquite particular, the perception, to the essentially general, the\nconception. For by the analysis of conceptions into their essential\npredicates it must be possible to decide upon purely logical grounds\nwhether they are capable of being united or not, and for this the mere\nreason which every one possesses is sufficient. The faculty of judgment is\ntherefore only active here in shortening this process, for he who is\ngifted with it sees at a glance what others only arrive at through a\nseries of reflections. But its activity in the narrower sense really only\nappears when what is known through perception, thus the real experience,\nhas to be carried over into distinct abstract knowledge, subsumed under\naccurately corresponding conceptions, and thus translated into reflected\nrational knowledge. It is therefore this faculty which has to establish\nthe firm _basis_ of all sciences, which always consists of what is known\ndirectly and cannot be further denied. Therefore here, in the fundamental\njudgments, lies the difficulty of the sciences, not in the inferences from\nthese. To infer is easy, to judge is difficult. False inferences are rare,\nfalse judgments are always the order of the day. Not less in practical\nlife has the faculty of judgment to give the decision in all fundamental\nconclusions and important determinations. Its office is in the main like\nthat of the judicial sentence. As the burning-glass brings to a focus all\nthe sun’s rays, so when the understanding works, the intellect has to\nbring together all the data which it has upon the subject so closely that\nthe understanding comprehends them at a glance, which it now rightly\nfixes, and then carefully makes the result distinct to itself. Further,\nthe great difficulty of judging in most cases depends upon the fact that\nwe have to proceed from the consequent to the reason, a path which is\nalways uncertain; indeed I have shown that the source of all error lies\nhere. Yet in all the empirical sciences, and also in the affairs of real\nlife, this way is for the most part the only one open to us. The\nexperiment is an attempt to go over it again the other way; therefore it\nis decisive, and at least brings out error clearly; provided always that\nit is rightly chosen and honestly carried out; not like Newton’s\nexperiments in connection with the theory of colours. But the experiment\nitself must also again be judged. The complete certainty of the _a priori_\nsciences, logic and mathematics, depends principally upon the fact that in\nthem the path from the reason to the consequent is open to us, and it is\nalways certain. This gives them the character of _purely objective_\nsciences, _i.e._, sciences with regard to whose truths all who understand\nthem must judge alike; and this is all the more remarkable as they are the\nvery sciences which rest on the subjective forms of the intellect, while\nthe empirical sciences alone have to do with what is palpably objective.\n\nWit and ingenuity are also manifestations of the faculty of judgment; in\nthe former its activity is reflective, in the latter subsuming. In most\nmen the faculty of judgment is only nominally present; it is a kind of\nirony that it is reckoned with the normal faculties of the mind, instead\nof being only attributed to the _monstris per excessum_. Ordinary men show\neven in the smallest affairs want of confidence in their own judgment,\njust because they know from experience that it is of no service. With them\nprejudice and imitation take its place; and thus they are kept in a state\nof continual non-age, from which scarcely one in many hundreds is\ndelivered. Certainly this is not avowed, for even to themselves they\nappear to judge; but all the time they are glancing stealthily at the\nopinion of others, which is their secret standard. While each one would be\nashamed to go about in a borrowed coat, hat, or mantle, they all have\nnothing but borrowed opinions, which they eagerly collect wherever they\ncan find them, and then strut about giving them out as their own. Others\nborrow them again from them and do the same thing. This explains the rapid\nand wide spread of errors, and also the fame of what is bad; for the\nprofessional purveyors of opinion, such as journalists and the like, give\nas a rule only false wares, as those who hire out masquerading dresses\ngive only false jewels.\n\nChapter VIII.(20) On The Theory Of The Ludicrous.\n\nMy theory of the ludicrous also depends upon the opposition explained in\nthe preceding chapters between perceptible and abstract ideas, which I\nhave brought into such marked prominence. Therefore what has still to be\nsaid in explanation of this theory finds its proper place here, although\naccording to the order of the text it would have to come later.\n\nThe problem of the origin, which is everywhere the same, and hence of the\npeculiar significance of laughter, was already known to Cicero, but only\nto be at once dismissed as insoluble (_De Orat._, ii. 58). The oldest\nattempt known to me at a psychological explanation of laughter is to be\nfound in Hutcheson’s “Introduction into Moral Philosophy,” Bk. I., ch. i.",

    "page_content": "Morals du Rire_,” 1768, is not without merit as a ventilation of the\nsubject. Platner, in his “Anthropology,” § 894, has collected the opinions\nof the philosophers from Hume to Kant who have attempted an explanation of\nthis phenomenon peculiar to human nature. Kant’s and Jean Paul’s theories\nof the ludicrous are well known. I regard it as unnecessary to prove their\nincorrectness, for whoever tries to refer given cases of the ludicrous to\nthem will in the great majority of instances be at once convinced of their\ninsufficiency.\n\nAccording to my explanation given in the first volume, the source of the\nludicrous is always the paradoxical, and therefore unexpected, subsumption\nof an object under a conception which in other respects is different from\nit, and accordingly the phenomenon of laughter always signifies the sudden\napprehension of an incongruity between such a conception and the real\nobject thought under it, thus between the abstract and the concrete object\nof perception. The greater and more unexpected, in the apprehension of the\nlaughter, this incongruity is, the more violent will be his laughter.\nTherefore in everything that excites laughter it must always be possible\nto show a conception and a particular, that is, a thing or event, which\ncertainly can be subsumed under that conception, and therefore thought\nthrough it, yet in another and more predominating aspect does not belong\nto it at all, but is strikingly different from everything else that is\nthought through that conception. If, as often occurs, especially in\nwitticisms, instead of such a real object of perception, the conception of\na subordinate species is brought under the higher conception of the genus,\nit will yet excite laughter only through the fact that the imagination\nrealises it, _i.e._, makes a perceptible representative stand for it, and\nthus the conflict between what is thought and what is perceived takes\nplace. Indeed if we wish to understand this perfectly explicitly, it is\npossible to trace everything ludicrous to a syllogism in the first figure,\nwith an undisputed _major_ and an unexpected _minor_, which to a certain\nextent is only sophistically valid, in consequence of which connection the\nconclusion partakes of the quality of the ludicrous.\n\nIn the first volume I regarded it as superfluous to illustrate this theory\nby examples, for every one can do this for himself by a little reflection\nupon cases of the ludicrous which he remembers. Yet, in order to come to\nthe assistance of the mental inertness of those readers who prefer always\nto remain in a passive condition, I will accommodate myself to them.\nIndeed in this third edition I wish to multiply and accumulate examples,\nso that it may be indisputable that here, after so many fruitless earlier\nattempts, the true theory of the ludicrous is given, and the problem which\nwas proposed and also given up by Cicero is definitely solved.\n\nIf we consider that an angle requires two lines meeting so that if they\nare produced they will intersect each other; on the other hand, that the\ntangent of a circle only touches it at one point, but at this point is\nreally parallel to it; and accordingly have present to our minds the\nabstract conviction of the impossibility of an angle between the\ncircumference of a circle and its tangent; and if now such an angle lies\nvisibly before us upon paper, this will easily excite a smile. The\nludicrousness in this case is exceedingly weak; but yet the source of it\nin the incongruity of what is thought and perceived appears in it with\nexceptional distinctness. When we discover such an incongruity, the\noccasion for laughter that thereby arises is, according as we pass from\nthe real, _i.e._, the perceptible, to the conception, or conversely from\nthe conception to the real, either a witticism or an absurdity, which in a\nhigher degree, and especially in the practical sphere, is folly, as was\nexplained in the text. Now to consider examples of the first case, thus of\nwit, we shall first of all take the familiar anecdote of the Gascon at\nwhom the king laughed when he saw him in light summer clothing in the\ndepth of winter, and who thereupon said to the king: “If your Majesty had\nput on what I have, you would find it very warm;” and on being asked what\nhe had put on, replied: “My whole wardrobe!” Under this last conception we\nhave to think both the unlimited wardrobe of a king and the single summer\ncoat of a poor devil, the sight of which upon his freezing body shows its\ngreat incongruity with the conception. The audience in a theatre in Paris\nonce called for the “Marseillaise” to be played, and as this was not done,\nbegan shrieking and howling, so that at last a commissary of police in\nuniform came upon the stage and explained that it was not allowed that\nanything should be given in the theatre except what was in the playbill.\nUpon this a voice cried: “_Et vous, Monsieur, êtes-vous aussi sur\nl’affiche?_”—a hit which was received with universal laughter. For here\nthe subsumption of what is heterogeneous is at once distinct and unforced.\nThe epigramme:\n\n    “Bav is the true shepherd of whom the Bible spake:\n    Though his flock be all asleep, he alone remains awake:”\n\nsubsumes, under the conception of a sleeping flock and a waking shepherd,\nthe tedious preacher who still bellows on unheard when he has sent all the\npeople to sleep. Analogous to this is the epitaph on a doctor: “Here lies\nhe like a hero, and those he has slain lie around him;” it subsumes under\nthe conception, honourable to the hero, of “lying surrounded by dead\nbodies,” the doctor, who is supposed to preserve life. Very commonly the\nwitticism consists in a single expression, through which only the\nconception is given, under which the case presented can be subsumed,\nthough it is very different from everything else that is thought under it.\nSo is it in “Romeo” when the vivacious Mercutio answers his friends who\npromise to visit him on the morrow: “Ask for me to-morrow, and you shall\nfind me a grave man.” Under this conception a dead man is here subsumed;\nbut in English there is also a play upon the words, for “a grave man”\nmeans both a serious man and a man of the grave. Of this kind is also the\nwell-known anecdote of the actor Unzelmann. In the Berlin theatre he was\nstrictly forbidden to improvise. Soon afterwards he had to appear on the\nstage on horseback, and just as he came on the stage the horse dunged, at\nwhich the audience began to laugh, but laughed much more when Unzelmann\nsaid to the horse: “What are you doing? Don’t you know we are forbidden to\nimprovise?” Here the subsumption of the heterogeneous under the more\ngeneral conception is very distinct, but the witticism is exceedingly\nhappy, and the ludicrous effect produced by it excessively strong. To this\nclass also belongs the following announcement from Hall in a newspaper of\nMarch 1851: “The band of Jewish swindlers to which we have referred were\nagain delivered over to us with obligato accompaniment.” This subsuming of\na police escort under a musical term is very happy, though it approaches\nthe mere play upon words. On the other hand, it is exactly a case of the\nkind we are considering when Saphir, in a paper-war with the actor Angeli,\ndescribes him as “Angeli, who is equally great in mind and body.” The\nsmall statue of the actor was known to the whole town, and thus under the\nconception “great” unusual smallness was presented to the mind. Also when\nthe same Saphir calls the airs of a new opera “good old friends,” and so\nbrings the quality which is most to be condemned under a conception which\nis usually employed to commend. Also, if we should say of a lady whose\nfavour could be influenced by presents, that she knew how to combine the\n_utile_ with the _dulci_. For here we bring the moral life under the\nconception of a rule which Horace has recommended in an æsthetical\nreference. Also if to signify a brothel we should call it the “modest\nabode of quiet joys.” Good society, in order to be thoroughly insipid, has\nforbidden all decided utterances, and therefore all strong expressions.\nTherefore it is wont, when it has to signify scandalous or in any way\nindecent things, to mitigate or extenuate them by expressing them through\ngeneral conceptions. But in this way it happens that they are more or less\nincongruously subsumed, and in a corresponding degree the effect of the\nludicrous is produced. To this class belongs the use of _utile dulci_\nreferred to above, and also such expressions as the following: “He had\nunpleasantness at the ball” when he was thrashed and kicked out; or, “He\nhas done too well” when he is drunk; and also, “The woman has weak\nmoments” if she is unfaithful to her husband, &c. Equivocal sayings also\nbelong to the same class. They are conceptions which in themselves contain\nnothing improper, but yet the case brought under them leads to an improper\nidea. They are very common in society. But a perfect example of a full and\nmagnificent equivocation is Shenstone’s incomparable epitaph on a justice\nof the peace, which, in its high-flown lapidary style, seems to speak of\nnoble and sublime things, while under each of their conceptions something\nquite different is to be subsumed, which only appears in the very last\nword as the unexpected key to the whole, and the reader discovers with\nloud laughter that he has only read a very obscene equivocation. In this\nsmooth-combed age it is altogether impossible to quote this here, not to\nspeak of translating it; it will be found in Shenstone’s poetical works,\nunder the title “Inscription.” Equivocations sometimes pass over into mere\npuns, about which all that is necessary has been said in the text.\n\nFurther, the ultimate subsumption, ludicrous to all, of what in one\nrespect is heterogeneous, under a conception which in other respects\nagrees with it, may take place contrary to our intention. For example, one\nof the free negroes in North America, who take pains to imitate the whites\nin everything, quite recently placed an epitaph over his dead child which\nbegins, “Lovely, early broken lily.” If, on the contrary, something real\nand perceptible is, with direct intention, brought under the conception of\nits opposite, the result is plain, common irony. For example, if when it\nis raining hard we say, “Nice weather we are having to-day;” or if we say\nof an ugly bride, “That man has found a charming treasure;” or of a knave,\n“This honest man,” &c. &c. Only children and quite uneducated people will\nlaugh at such things; for here the incongruity between what is thought and\nwhat is perceived is total. Yet just in this direct exaggeration in the\nproduction of the ludicrous its fundamental character, incongruity,\nappears very distinctly. This species of the ludicrous is, on account of\nits exaggeration and distinct intention, in some respects related to\n_parody_. The procedure of the latter consists in this. It substitutes for\nthe incidents and words of a serious poem or drama insignificant low\npersons or trifling motives and actions. It thus subsumes the commonplace\nrealities which it sets forth under the lofty conceptions given in the\ntheme, under which in a certain respect they must come, while in other\nrespects they are very incongruous; and thereby the contrast between what\nis perceived and what is thought appears very glaring. There is no lack of\nfamiliar examples of this, and therefore I shall only give one, from the\n“Zobeide” of Carlo Gozzi, act iv., scene 3, where the famous stanza of\nAriosto (_Orl. Fur._, i. 22), “_Oh gran bontà de’ cavalieri antichi_,”\n&c., is put word for word into the mouth of two clowns who have just been\nthrashing each other, and tired with this, lie quietly side by side. This\nis also the nature of the application so popular in Germany of serious\nverses, especially of Schiller, to trivial events, which clearly contains\na subsumption of heterogeneous things under the general conception which\nthe verse expresses. Thus, for example, when any one has displayed a very\ncharacteristic trait, there will rarely be wanting some one to say, “From\nthat I know with whom I have to do.” But it was original and very witty of\na man who was in love with a young bride to quote to the newly married\ncouple (I know not how loudly) the concluding words of Schiller’s ballad,\n“The Surety:”\n\n    “Let me be, I pray you,\n    In your bond the third.”\n\nThe effect of the ludicrous is here strong and inevitable, because under\nthe conceptions through which Schiller presents to the mind a moral and\nnoble relation, a forbidden and immoral relation is subsumed, and yet\ncorrectly and without change, thus is thought through it. In all the\nexamples of wit given here we find that under a conception, or in general\nan abstract thought, a real thing is, directly, or by means of a narrower\nconception, subsumed, which indeed, strictly speaking, comes under it, and\nyet is as different as possible from the proper and original intention and\ntendency of the thought. Accordingly wit, as a mental capacity, consists\nentirely in a facility for finding for every object that appears a\nconception under which it certainly can be thought, though it is very\ndifferent from all the other objects which come under this conception.\n\nThe second species of the ludicrous follows, as we have mentioned, the\nopposite path from the abstract conception to the real or perceptible\nthings thought through it. But this now brings to light any incongruity\nwith the conception which was overlooked, and hence arises an absurdity,\nand therefore in the practical sphere a foolish action. Since the play\nrequires action, this species of the ludicrous is essential to comedy.\nUpon this depends the observation of Voltaire: “_J’ai cru remarquer aux\nspectacles, qu’il ne s’élève presque jamais de ces éclats de rire\nuniversels, qu’à l’occasion d’une_ MÉPRISE” (_\n\nThere are also cases of the ludicrous where the conception under which the\nperceptible facts are brought does not require to be expressed or\nsignified, but comes into consciousness itself through the association of\nideas. The laughter into which Garrick burst in the middle of playing\ntragedy because a butcher in the front of the pit, who had taken off his\nwig to wipe the sweat from his head, placed the wig for a while upon his\nlarge dog, who stood facing the stage with his fore paws resting on the\npit railings, was occasioned by the fact that Garrick started from the\nconception of a spectator, which was added in his own mind. This is the\nreason why certain animal forms, such as apes, kangaroos, jumping-hares,\n&c., sometimes appear to us ludicrous because something about them\nresembling man leads us to subsume them under the conception of the human\nform, and starting from this we perceive their incongruity with it.\n\nNow the conceptions whose observed incongruity with the perceptions moves\nus to laughter are either those of others or our own. In the first case we\nlaugh at others, in the second we feel a surprise, often agreeable, at the\nleast amusing. Therefore children and uneducated people laugh at the most\ntrifling things, even at misfortunes, if they were unexpected, and thus\nconvicted their preconceived conception of error. As a rule laughing is a\npleasant condition; accordingly the apprehension of the incongruity\nbetween what is thought and what is perceived, that is, the real, gives us\npleasure, and we give ourselves up gladly to the spasmodic convulsions\nwhich this apprehension excites. The reason of this is as follows. In\nevery suddenly appearing conflict between what is perceived and what is\nthought, what is perceived is always unquestionably right; for it is not\nsubject to error at all, requires no confirmation from without, but\nanswers for itself. Its conflict with what is thought springs ultimately\nfrom the fact that the latter, with its abstract conceptions, cannot get\ndown to the infinite multifariousness and fine shades of difference of the\nconcrete. This victory of knowledge of perception over thought affords us\npleasure. For perception is the original kind of knowledge inseparable\nfrom animal nature, in which everything that gives direct satisfaction to\nthe will presents itself. It is the medium of the present, of enjoyment\nand gaiety; moreover it is attended with no exertion. With thinking the\nopposite is the case; it is the second power of knowledge, the exercise of\nwhich always demands some, and often considerable, exertion. Besides, it\nis the conceptions of thought that often oppose the gratification of our\nimmediate desires, for, as the medium of the past, the future, and of\nseriousness, they are the vehicle of our fears, our repentance, and all\nour cares. It must therefore be diverting to us to see this strict,\nuntiring, troublesome governess, the reason, for once convicted of\ninsufficiency. On this account then the mien or appearance of laughter is\nvery closely related to that of joy.\n\nOn account of the want of reason, thus of general conceptions, the brute\nis incapable of laughter, as of speech. This is therefore a prerogative\nand characteristic mark of man. Yet it may be remarked in passing that his\none friend the dog has an analogous characteristic action peculiar to him\nalone in distinction from all other brutes, the very expressive, kindly,\nand thoroughly honest fawning and wagging of its tail. But how favourably\ndoes this salutation given him by nature compare with the bows and\nsimpering civilities of men. At least for the present, it is a thousand\ntimes more reliable than their assurance of inward friendship and\ndevotion.\n\nThe opposite of laughing and joking is _seriousness_. Accordingly it\nconsists in the consciousness of the perfect agreement and congruity of\nthe conception, or thought, with what is perceived, or the reality. The\nserious man is convinced that he thinks the things as they are, and that\nthey are as he thinks them. This is just why the transition from profound\nseriousness to laughter is so easy, and can be effected by trifles. For\nthe more perfect that agreement assumed by seriousness may seem to be, the\nmore easily is it destroyed by the unexpected discovery of even a slight\nincongruity. Therefore the more a man is capable of entire seriousness,\nthe more heartily can he laugh. Men whose laughter is always affected and\nforced are intellectually and morally of little worth; and in general the\nway of laughing, and, on the other hand, the occasions of it, are very\ncharacteristic of the person. That the relations of the sexes afford the\neasiest materials for jokes always ready to hand and within the reach of\nthe weakest wit, as is proved by the abundance of obscene jests, could not\nbe if it were not that the deepest seriousness lies at their foundation.\n\nThat the laughter of others at what we do or say seriously offends us so\nkeenly depends on the fact that it asserts that there is a great\nincongruity between our conceptions and the objective realities. For the\nsame reason, the predicate “ludicrous” or “absurd” is insulting. The laugh\nof scorn announces with triumph to the baffled adversary how incongruous\nwere the conceptions he cherished with the reality which is now revealing\nitself to him. Our own bitter laughter at the fearful disclosure of the\ntruth through which our firmly cherished expectations are proved to be\ndelusive is the active expression of the discovery now made of the\nincongruity between the thoughts which, in our foolish confidence in man\nor fate, we entertained, and the truth which is now unveiled.\n\nThe _intentionally_ ludicrous is the _joke_. It is the effort to bring\nabout a discrepancy between the conceptions of another and the reality by\ndisarranging one of the two; while its opposite, _seriousness_, consists\nin the exact conformity of the two to each other, which is at least aimed\nat. But if now the joke is concealed behind seriousness, then we have\n_irony_. For example, if with apparent seriousness we acquiesce in the\nopinions of another which are the opposite of our own, and pretend to\nshare them with him, till at last the result perplexes him both as to us\nand them. This is the attitude of Socrates as opposed to Hippias,\nProtagoras, Gorgias, and other sophists, and indeed often to his\ncollocutors in general. The converse of irony is accordingly seriousness\nconcealed behind a joke, and this is _humour_. It might be called the\ndouble counterpoint of irony. Explanations such as “Humour is the\ninterpenetration of the finite and the infinite” express nothing more than\nthe entire incapacity for thought of those who are satisfied with such\nempty phrases. Irony is objective, that is, intended for another; but\nhumour is subjective, that is, it primarily exists only for one’s own\nself. Accordingly we find the masterpieces of irony among the ancients,\nbut those of humour among the moderns. For, more closely considered,\nhumour depends upon a subjective, yet serious and sublime mood, which is\ninvoluntarily in conflict with a common external world very different from\nitself, which it cannot escape from and to which it will not give itself\nup; therefore, as an accommodation, it tries to think its own point of\nview and that external world through the same conceptions, and thus a\ndouble incongruity arises, sometimes on the one side, sometimes on the\nother, between these concepts and the realities thought through them.\nHence the impression of the intentionally ludicrous, thus of the joke, is\nproduced, behind which, however, the deepest seriousness is concealed and\nshines through. Irony begins with a serious air and ends with a smile;\nwith humour the order is reversed. The words of Mercutio quoted above may\nserve as an example of humour. Also in “Hamlet”—_Polonius_: “My honourable\nlord, I will most humbly take my leave of you. _Hamlet_: You cannot, sir,\ntake from me anything that I will more willingly part withal, except my\nlife, except my life, except my life.” Again, before the introduction of\nthe play at court, Hamlet says to Ophelia: “What should a man do but be\nmerry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died\nwithin these two hours. _Ophelia_: Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.\n_Hamlet_: So long? Nay, then let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a\nsuit of sables.”\n\nAgain, in Jean Paul’s “Titan,” when Schoppe, melancholy and now brooding\nover himself, frequently looking at his hands, says to himself, “There\nsits a lord in bodily reality, and I in him; but who is such?” Heinrich\nHeine appears as a true humourist in his “_Romancero_.” Behind all his\njokes and drollery we discern a profound seriousness, which is ashamed to\nappear unveiled. Accordingly humour depends upon a special kind of mood or\ntemper (German, _Laune_, probably from _Luna_) through which conception in\nall its modifications, a decided predominance of the subjective over the\nobjective in the apprehension of the external world, is thought. Moreover,\nevery poetical or artistic presentation of a comical, or indeed even a\nfarcical scene, through which a serious thought yet glimmers as its\nconcealed background, is a production of humour, thus is humorous. Such,\nfor example, is a coloured drawing of Tischbein’s, which represents an\nempty room, lighted only by the blazing fire in the grate. Before the fire\nstands a man with his coat off, in such a position that his shadow, going\nout from his feet, stretches across the whole room. Tischbein comments\nthus on the drawing: “This is a man who has succeeded in nothing in the\nworld, and who has made nothing of it; now he rejoices that he can throw\nsuch a large shadow.” Now, if I had to express the seriousness that lies\nconcealed behind this jest, I could best do so by means of the following\nverse taken from the Persian poem of Anwari Soheili:—\n\n    “If thou hast lost possession of a world,\n      Be not distressed, for it is nought;\n    Or hast thou gained possession of a world,\n      Be not o’erjoyed, for it is nought.\n    Our pains, our gains, all pass away;\n      Get thee beyond the world, for it is nought.”\n\nThat at the present day the word humorous is generally used in German\nliterature in the sense of comical arises from the miserable desire to\ngive things a more distinguished name than belongs to them, the name of a\nclass that stands above them. Thus every inn must be called a hotel, every\nmoney-changer a banker, every concert a musical academy, the merchant’s\ncounting-house a bureau, the potter an artist in clay, and therefore also\nevery clown a humourist. The word _humour_ is borrowed from the English to\ndenote a quite peculiar species of the ludicrous, which indeed, as was\nsaid above, is related to the sublime, and which was first remarked by\nthem. But it is not intended to be used as the title for all kinds of\njokes and buffoonery, as is now universally the case in Germany, without\nopposition from men of letters and scholars; for the true conception of\nthat modification, that tendency of the mind, that child of the sublime\nand the ridiculous, would be too subtle and too high for their public, to\nplease which they take pains to make everything flat and vulgar. Well,\n“high words and a low meaning” is in general the motto of the noble\npresent, and accordingly now-a-days he is called a humourist who was\nformerly, called a buffoon.\n\nChapter IX.(21) On Logic In General.\n\nLogic, Dialectic, and Rhetoric go together, because they make up the whole\nof a _technic of reason_, and under this title they ought also to be\ntaught—Logic as the technic of our own thinking, Dialectic of disputing\nwith others, and Rhetoric of speaking to many (_concionatio_); thus\ncorresponding to the singular, dual, and plural, and to the monologue, the\ndialogue, and the panegyric.\n\nUnder Dialectic I understand, in agreement with Aristotle (_Metaph._, iii.\n2, and _Analyt. Post._, i. 11), the art of conversation directed to the\nmutual investigation of truth, especially philosophical truth. But a\nconversation of this kind necessarily passes more or less into\ncontroversy; therefore dialectic may also be explained as the art of\ndisputation. We have examples and patterns of dialectic in the Platonic\ndialogues; but for the special theory of it, thus for the technical rules\nof disputation, eristics, very little has hitherto been accomplished. I\nhave worked out an attempt of the kind, and given an example of it, in the\nsecond volume of the “Parerga,” therefore I shall pass over the exposition\nof this science altogether here.\n\nIn Rhetoric the rhetorical figures are very much what the syllogistic\nfigures are in Logic; at all events they are worth considering. In\nAristotle’s time they seem to have not yet become the object of\ntheoretical investigation, for he does not treat of them in any of his\nrhetorics, and in this reference we are referred to Rutilius Lupus, the\nepitomiser of a later Gorgias.\n\nAll the three sciences have this in common, that without having learned\nthem we follow their rules, which indeed are themselves first abstracted\nfrom this natural employment of them. Therefore, although they are of\ngreat theoretical interest, they are of little practical use; partly\nbecause, though they certainly give the rule, they do not give the case of\nits application; partly because in practice there is generally no time to\nrecollect the rules. Thus they teach only what every one already knows and\npractises of his own accord; but yet the abstract knowledge of this is\ninteresting and important. Logic will not easily have a practical value,\nat least for our own thinking. For the errors of our own reasoning\nscarcely ever lie in the inferences nor otherwise in the form, but in the\njudgments, thus in the matter of thought. In controversy, on the other\nhand, we can sometimes derive some practical use from logic, by taking the\nmore or less intentionally deceptive argument of our opponent, which he\nadvances under the garb and cover of continuous speech, and referring it\nto the strict form of regular syllogisms, and thus convicting it of\nlogical errors; for example, simple conversion of universal affirmative\njudgments, syllogisms with four terms, inferences from the consequent to\nthe reason, syllogisms in the second figure with merely affirmative\npremisses, and many such.\n\nIt seems to me that the doctrine of the laws of thought might be\nsimplified if we were only to set up two, the law of excluded middle and\nthat of sufficient reason. The former thus: “Every predicate can either be\naffirmed or denied of every subject.” Here it is already contained in the\n“either, or” that both cannot occur at once, and consequently just what is\nexpressed by the laws of identity and contradiction. Thus these would be\nadded as corollaries of that principle which really says that every two\nconcept-spheres must be thought either as united or as separated, but\nnever as both at once; and therefore, even although words are brought\ntogether which express the latter, these words assert a process of thought\nwhich cannot be carried out. The consciousness of this infeasibility is\nthe feeling of contradiction. The second law of thought, the principle of\nsufficient reason, would affirm that the above attributing or denying must\nbe determined by something different from the judgment itself, which may\nbe a (pure or empirical) perception, or merely another judgment. This\nother and different thing is then called the ground or reason of the\njudgment. So far as a judgment satisfies the first law of thought, it is\nthinkable; so far as it satisfies the second, it is true, or at least in\nthe case in which the ground of a judgment is only another judgment it is\nlogically or formally true. But, finally, material or absolute truth is\nalways the relation between a judgment and a perception, thus between the\nabstract and the concrete or perceptible idea. This is either an immediate\nrelation or it is brought about by means of other judgments, _i.e._,\nthrough other abstract ideas. From this it is easy to see that one truth\ncan never overthrow another, but all must ultimately agree; because in the\nconcrete or perceptible, which is their common foundation, no\ncontradiction is possible. Therefore no truth has anything to fear from\nother truths. Illusion and error have to fear every truth, because through\nthe logical connection of all truths even the most distant must some time\nstrike its blow at every error. This second law of thought is therefore\nthe connecting link between logic and what is no longer logic, but the\nmatter of thought. Consequently the agreement of the conceptions, thus of\nthe abstract idea with what is given in the perceptible idea, is, on the\nside of the object _truth_, and on the side of the subject _knowledge_.\n\nTo express the union or separation of two concept-spheres referred to\nabove is the work of the copula, “is—is not.” Through this every verb can\nbe expressed by means of its participle. Therefore all judging consists in\nthe use of a verb, and _vice versâ_. Accordingly the significance of the\ncopula is that the predicate is to be thought in the subject, nothing\nmore. Now, consider what the content of the infinitive of the copula “to\nbe” amounts to. But this is a principal theme of the professors of\nphilosophy of the present time. However, we must not be too strict with\nthem; most of them wish to express by it nothing but material things, the\ncorporeal world, to which, as perfectly innocent realists at the bottom of\ntheir hearts, they attribute the highest reality. To speak, however, of\nthe bodies so directly appears to them too vulgar; and therefore they say\n“being,” which they think sounds better, and think in connection with it\nthe tables and chairs standing before them.\n\n“For, because, why, therefore, thus, since, although, indeed, yet, but,\nif, then, either, or,” and more like these, are properly _logical\nparticles_, for their only end is to express the form of the thought\nprocesses. They are therefore a valuable possession of a language, and do\nnot belong to all in equal numbers. Thus “_zwar_” (the contracted “_es ist\nwahr_”) seems to belong exclusively to the German language. It is always\nconnected with an “_aber_” which follows or is added in thought, as “if”\nis connected with “then.”\n\nThe logical rule that, as regards quantity, singular judgments, that is,\njudgments which have a singular conception (_notio singularis_) for their\nsubject, are to be treated as _universal judgments_, depends upon the\ncircumstance that they are in fact universal judgments, which have merely\nthe peculiarity that their subject is a conception which can only be\nsupported by a single real object, and therefore only contains a single\nreal object under it; as when the conception is denoted by a proper name.\nThis, however, has really only to be considered when we proceed from the\nabstract idea to the concrete or perceptible, thus seek to realise the\nconceptions. In thinking itself, in operating with judgments, this makes\nno difference, simply because between singular and universal conceptions\nthere is no logical difference. “Immanuel Kant” signifies logically,\n“_all_ Immanuel Kant.” Accordingly the quantity of judgments is really\nonly of two kinds—universal and particular. An _individual idea_ cannot be\nthe subject of a judgment, because it is not an abstraction, it is not\nsomething thought, but something perceived. Every conception, on the other\nhand, is essentially universal, and every judgment must have a\n_conception_ as its subject.\n\nThe difference between _particular judgments_ (_propositiones\nparticulares_) and _universal judgments_ often depends merely on the\nexternal and contingent circumstance that the language has no word to\nexpress by itself the part that is here to be separated from the general\nconception which forms the subject of such a judgment. If there were such\na word many a particular judgment would be universal. For example, the\nparticular judgment, “Some trees bear gall-nuts,” becomes a universal\njudgment, because for this part of the conception, “tree,” we have a\nspecial word, “All oaks bear gall-nuts.” In the same way is the judgment,\n“Some men are black,” related to the judgment, “All negroes are black.” Or\nelse this difference depends upon the fact that in the mind of him who\njudges the conception which he makes the subject of the particular\njudgment has not become clearly separated from the general conception as a\npart of which he defines it; otherwise he could have expressed a universal\ninstead of a particular judgment. For example, instead of the judgment,\n“Some ruminants have upper incisors,” this, “All unhorned ruminants have\nupper incisors.”\n\nThe _hypothetical and disjunctive judgments_ are assertions as to the\nrelation of two (in the case of the disjunctive judgment even several)\ncategorical judgments to each other. The _hypothetical judgment_ asserts\nthat the truth of the second of the two categorical judgments here linked\ntogether depends upon the truth of the first, and the falseness of the\nfirst depends upon the falseness of the second; thus that these two\npropositions stand in direct community as regards truth and falseness. The\n_disjunctive judgment_, on the other hand, asserts that upon the truth of\none of the categorical judgments here linked together depends the\nfalseness of the others, and conversely; thus that these propositions are\nin conflict as regards truth and falseness. The _question_ is a judgment,\none of whose three parts is left open: thus either the copula, “Is Caius a\nRoman—or not?” or the predicate, “Is Caius a Roman—or something else?” or\nthe subject, “Is Caius a Roman—or is it some one else who is a Roman?” The\nplace of the conception which is left open may also remain quite empty;\nfor example, “What is Caius?”—“Who is a Roman?”\n\nThe επαγωγη, inductio, is with Aristotle the opposite of the απαγωγη. The\nlatter proves a proposition to be false by showing that what would follow\nfrom it is not true; thus by the _instantia in contrarium_. The επαγωγη,\non the other hand, proves the truth of a proposition by showing that what\nwould follow from it is true. Thus it leads by means of examples to our\naccepting something while the απαγωγη leads to our rejecting it. Therefore\nthe επαγωγη, or induction, is an inference from the consequents to the\nreason, and indeed _modo ponente_; for from many cases it establishes the\nrule, from which these cases then in their turn follow. On this account it\nis never perfectly certain, but at the most arrives at very great\nprobability. However, this _formal_ uncertainty may yet leave room for\n_material_ certainty through the number of the sequences observed; in the\nsame way as in mathematics the irrational relations are brought infinitely\nnear to rationality by means of decimal fractions. The απαγωγη, on the\ncontrary, is primarily an inference from the reason to the consequents,\nthough it is afterwards carried out _modo tollente_, in that it proves the\nnon-existence of a necessary consequent, and thereby destroys the truth of\nthe assumed reason. On this account it is always perfectly certain, and\naccomplishes more by a single example _in contrarium_ than the induction\ndoes by innumerable examples in favour of the proposition propounded. So\nmuch easier is it to refute than to prove, to overthrow than to establish.\n\nChapter X. On The Syllogism.\n\nAlthough it is very hard to establish a new and correct view of a subject\nwhich for more than two thousand years has been handled by innumerable\nwriters, and which, moreover, does not receive additions through the\ngrowth of experience, yet this must not deter me from presenting to the\nthinker for examination the following attempt of this kind.\n\nAn inference is that operation of our reason by virtue of which, through\nthe comparison of two judgments a third judgment arises, without the\nassistance of any knowledge otherwise obtained. The condition of this is\nthat these two judgments have _one_ conception in common, for otherwise\nthey are foreign to each other and have no community. But under this\ncondition they become the father and mother of a child that contains in\nitself something of both. Moreover, this operation is no arbitrary act,\nbut an act of the reason, which, when it has considered such judgments,\nperforms it of itself according to its own laws. So far it is objective,\nnot subjective, and therefore subject to the strictest rules.\n\nWe may ask in passing whether he who draws an inference really learns\nsomething new from the new proposition, something previously unknown to\nhim? Not absolutely; but yet to a certain extent he does. What he learns\nlay in what he knew: thus he knew it also, but he did not know that he\nknew it; which is as if he had something, but did not know that he had it,\nand this is just the same as if he had it not. He knew it only\n_implicite_, now he knows it _explicite_; but this distinction may be so\ngreat that the conclusion appears to him a new truth. For example:\n\n    All diamonds are stones;\n    All diamonds are combustible:\n    Therefore some stones are combustible.\n\nThe nature of inference consequently consists in this, that we bring it to\ndistinct consciousness that we have already thought in the premisses what\nis asserted in the conclusion. It is therefore a means of becoming more\ndistinctly conscious of one’s own knowledge, of learning more fully, or\nbecoming aware of what one knows. The knowledge which is afforded by the\nconclusion was _latent_, and therefore had just as little effect as latent\nheat has on the thermometer. Whoever has salt has also chlorine; but it is\nas if he had it not, for it can only act as chlorine if it is chemically\nevolved; thus only, then, does he really possess it. It is the same with\nthe gain which a mere conclusion from already known premisses affords: a\npreviously _bound or latent knowledge_ is thereby set _free_. These\ncomparisons may indeed seem to be somewhat strained, but yet they really\nare not. For because we draw many of the possible inferences from our\nknowledge very soon, very rapidly, and without formality, and therefore\nhave no distinct recollection of them, it seems to us as if no premisses\nfor possible conclusions remained long stored up unused, but as if we\nalready had also conclusions prepared for all the premisses within reach\nof our knowledge. But this is not always the case; on the contrary, two\npremisses may have for a long time an isolated existence in the same mind,\ntill at last some occasion brings them together, and then the conclusion\nsuddenly appears, as the spark comes from the steel and the stone only\nwhen they are struck together. In reality the premisses assumed from\nwithout, both for theoretical insight and for motives, which bring about\nresolves, often lie for a long time in us, and become, partly through\nhalf-conscious, and even inarticulate, processes of thought, compared with\nthe rest of our stock of knowledge, reflected upon, and, as it were,\nshaken up together, till at last the right major finds the right minor,\nand these immediately take up their proper places, and at once the\nconclusion exists as a light that has suddenly arisen for us, without any\naction on our part, as if it were an inspiration; for we cannot comprehend\nhow we and others have so long been in ignorance of it. It is true that in\na happily organised mind this process goes on more quickly and easily than\nin ordinary minds; and just because it is carried on spontaneously and\nwithout distinct consciousness it cannot be learned. Therefore Goethe\nsays: “How easy anything is he knows who has discovered it, he knows who\nhas attained to it.” As an illustration of the process of thought here\ndescribed we may compare it to those padlocks which consist of rings with\nletters; hanging on the box of a travelling carriage, they are shaken so\nlong that at last the letters of the word come together in their order and\nthe lock opens. For the rest, we must also remember that the syllogism\nconsists in the process of thought itself, and the words and propositions\nthrough which it is expressed only indicate the traces it has left behind\nit—they are related to it as the sound-figures of sand are related to the\nnotes whose vibrations they express. When we reflect upon something, we\ncollect our data, reduce them to judgments, which are all quickly brought\ntogether and compared, and thereby the conclusions which it is possible to\ndraw from them are instantly arrived at by means of the use of all the\nthree syllogistic figures. Yet on account of the great rapidity of this\noperation only a few words are used, and sometimes none at all, and only\nthe conclusion is formally expressed. Thus it sometimes happens that\nbecause in this way, or even merely intuitively, _i.e._, by a happy\n_apperçu_, we have brought some new truth to consciousness, we now treat\nit as a conclusion and seek premisses for it, that is, we desire to prove\nit, for as a rule knowledge exists earlier than its proofs. We then go\nthrough our stock of knowledge in order to see whether we can find some\ntruth in it in which the newly discovered truth was already implicitly\ncontained, or two propositions which would give this as a result if they\nwere brought together according to rule. On the other hand, every judicial\nproceeding affords a most complete and imposing syllogism, a syllogism in\nthe first figure. The civil or criminal transgression complained of is the\nminor; it is established by the prosecutor. The law applicable to the case\nis the major. The judgment is the conclusion, which therefore, as\nsomething necessary, is “merely recognised” by the judge.\n\nBut now I shall attempt to give the simplest and most correct exposition\nof the peculiar mechanism of inference.\n\n_Judging_, this elementary and most important process of thought, consists\nin the comparison of two _conceptions_; _inference_ in the comparison of\ntwo _judgments_. Yet ordinarily in text-books inference is also referred\nto the comparison of conceptions, though of _three_, because from the\nrelation which two of these conceptions have to a third their relation to\neach other may be known. Truth cannot be denied to this view also; and\nsince it affords opportunity for the perceptible demonstration of\nsyllogistic relations by means of drawn concept-spheres, a method approved\nof by me in the text, it has the advantage of making the matter easily\ncomprehensible. But it seems to me that here, as in so many cases,\ncomprehensibility is attained at the cost of thoroughness. The real\nprocess of thought in inference, with which the three syllogistic figures\nand their necessity precisely agree, is not thus recognised. In inference\nwe operate _not_ with mere _conceptions_ but with whole _judgments_, to\nwhich quality, which lies only in the copula and not in the conceptions,\nand also quantity are absolutely essential, and indeed we have further to\nadd modality. That exposition of inference as a relation of _three\nconceptions_ fails in this, that it at once resolves the judgments into\ntheir ultimate elements (the conceptions), and thus the means of combining\nthese is lost, and that which is peculiar to the judgments as such and in\ntheir completeness, which is just what constitutes the necessity of the\nconclusion which follows from them, is lost sight of. It thus falls into\nan error analogous to that which organic chemistry would commit if, for\nexample, in the analysis of plants it were at once to reduce them to their\n_ultimate_ elements, when it would find in all plants carbon, hydrogen,\nand oxygen, but would lose the specific differences, to obtain which it is\nnecessary to stop at their more special elements, the so-called alkaloids,\nand to take care to analyse these in their turn. From three given\nconceptions no conclusion can as yet be drawn. It may certainly be said:\nthe relation of two of them to the third must be given with them. But it\nis just the _judgments_ which combine these conceptions, that are the\nexpression of this relation; thus _judgments_, not mere _conceptions_, are\nthe material of the inference. Accordingly inference is essentially a\ncomparison of two _judgments_. The process of thought in our mind is\nconcerned with these and the thoughts expressed by them, not merely with\nthree conceptions. This is the case even when this process is imperfectly\nor not at all expressed in words; and it is as such, as a bringing\ntogether of the complete and unanalysed judgments, that we must consider\nit in order properly to understand the technical procedure of inference.\nFrom this there will then also follow the necessity for three really\nrational syllogistic figures.\n\nAs in the exposition of syllogistic reasoning by means of\n_concept-spheres_ these are presented to the mind under the form of\ncircles, so in the exposition by means of entire judgments we have to\nthink these under the form of rods, which, for the purpose of comparison,\nare held together now by one end, now by the other. The different ways in\nwhich this can take place give the three figures. Since now every premiss\ncontains its subject and its predicate, these two conceptions are to be\nimagined as situated at the two ends of each rod. The two judgments are\nnow compared with reference to the two _different_ conceptions in them;\nfor, as has already been said, the third conception must be the same in\nboth, and is therefore subject to no comparison, but is that _with which_,\nthat is, in reference to which, the other two are compared; it is the\n_middle_. The latter is accordingly always only the means and not the\nchief concern. The two different conceptions, on the other hand, are the\nsubject of reflection, and to find out their relation to each other by\nmeans of the judgments in which they are contained is the aim of the\nsyllogism. Therefore the conclusion speaks only of them, not of the\nmiddle, which was only a means, a measuring rod, which we let fall as soon\nas it has served its end. Now if this conception which is _identical_ in\nboth propositions, thus the middle, is the subject of _one_ premiss, the\nconception to be compared with it must be the predicate, and conversely.\nHere at once is established _a priori_ the possibility of three cases;\neither the subject of one premiss is compared with the predicate of the\nother, or the subject of the one with the subject of the other, or,\nfinally, the predicate of the one with the predicate of the other. Hence\narise the three syllogistic figures of Aristotle; the fourth, which was\nadded somewhat impertinently, is ungenuine and a spurious form. It is\nattributed to Galenus, but this rests only on Arabian authority. Each of\nthe three figures exhibits a perfectly different, correct, and natural\nthought-process of the reason in inference.\n\nIf in the two judgments to be compared the relation between the _predicate\nof the one and the subject of the other_ is the object of the comparison,\nthe _first figure_ appears. This figure alone has the advantage that the\nconceptions which in the conclusion are subject and predicate both appear\nalready in the same character in the premisses; while in the two other\nfigures one of them must always change its roll in the conclusion. But\nthus in the first figure the result is always less novel and surprising\nthan in the other two. Now this advantage in the first figure is obtained\nby the fact that the predicate of the major is compared with the subject\nof the minor, but not conversely, which is therefore here essential, and\ninvolves that the middle should assume both the positions, _i.e._, it is\nthe subject in the major and the predicate in the minor. And from this\nagain arises its subordinate significance, for it appears as a mere weight\nwhich we lay at pleasure now in one scale and now in the other. The course\nof thought in this figure is, that the predicate of the major is\nattributed to the subject of the minor, because the subject of the major\nis the predicate of the minor, or, in the negative case, the converse\nholds for the same reason. Thus here a property is attributed to the\nthings thought through a conception, because it depends upon another\nproperty which we already know they possess; or conversely. Therefore here\nthe guiding principle is: _Nota notæ est nota rei ipsius, et repugnans\nnotæ repugnat rei ipsi_.\n\nIf, on the other hand, we compare two judgments with the intention of\nbringing out the relation which the _subjects of both_ may have to each\nother, we must take as the common measure their predicate. This will\naccordingly be here the middle, and must therefore be the same in both\njudgments. Hence arises the _second figure_. In it the relation of two\nsubjects to each other is determined by that which they have as their\ncommon predicate. But this relation can only have significance if the same\npredicate is attributed to the one subject and denied of the other, for\nthus it becomes an essential ground of distinction between the two. For if\nit were attributed to both the subjects this could decide nothing as to\ntheir relation to each other, for almost every predicate belongs to\ninnumerable subjects. Still less would it decide this relation if the\npredicate were denied of both the subjects. From this follows the\nfundamental characteristic of the second figure, that the premisses must\nbe of _opposite quality_; the one must affirm and the other deny.\nTherefore here the principal rule is: _Sit altera negans_; the corollary\nof which is: _E meris affirmativis nihil sequitur_; a rule which is\nsometimes transgressed in a loose argument obscured by many parenthetical\npropositions. The course of thought which this figure exhibits distinctly\nappears from what has been said. It is the investigation of two kinds of\nthings with the view of distinguishing them, thus of establishing that\nthey are _not_ of the same species; which is here decided by showing that\na certain property is essential to the one kind, which the other lacks.\nThat this course of thought assumes the second figure of its own accord,\nand expresses itself clearly only in it, will be shown by an example:\n\n    All fishes have cold blood;\n    No whale has cold blood:\n    Thus no whale is a fish.\n\nIn the first figure, on the other hand, this thought exhibits itself in a\nweak, forced, and ultimately patched-up form:\n\n    Nothing that has cold blood is a whale;\n    All fishes have cold blood:\n    Thus no fish is a whale,\n    And consequently no whale is a fish.\n\nTake also an example with an affirmative minor:\n\n    No Mohamedan is a Jew;\n    Some Turks are Jews:\n    Therefore some Turks are not Mohamedans.\n\nAs the guiding principle for this figure I therefore give, for the mood\nwith the negative minor: _Cui repugnat nota, etiam repugnat notatum_; and\nfor the mood with the affirmative minor: _Notato repugnat id cui nota\nrepugnat_. Translated these may be thus combined: Two subjects which stand\nin opposite relations to one predicate have a negative relation to each\nother.\n\nThe third case is that in which we place two judgments together in order\nto investigate the relation of their _predicates_. Hence arises the _third\nfigure_, in which accordingly the middle appears in both premisses as the\nsubject. It is also here the _tertium comparationis_, the measure which is\napplied to both the conceptions which are to be investigated, or, as it\nwere, a chemical reagent, with which we test them both in order to learn\nfrom their relation to it what relation exists between themselves. Thus,\nthen, the conclusion declares whether a relation of subject and predicate\nexists between the two, and to what extent this is the case. Accordingly,\nwhat exhibits itself in this figure is reflection concerning two\nproperties which we are inclined to regard either as _incompatible_, or\nelse as _inseparable_, and in order to decide this we attempt to make them\nthe predicates of one subject in two judgments. From this it results\neither that both properties belong to the same thing, consequently their\n_compatibility_, or else that a thing has the one but not the other,\nconsequently their _separableness_. The former in all moods with two\naffirmative premisses, the latter in all moods with one negative; for\nexample:\n\n    Some brutes can speak;\n    All brutes are irrational:\n    Therefore some irrational beings can speak.\n\nAccording to Kant (_Die Falsche Spitzfinigkeit_, § 4) this inference would\nonly be conclusive if we added in thought: “Therefore some irrational\nbeings are brutes.” But this seems to be here quite superfluous and by no\nmeans the natural process of thought. But in order to carry out the same\nprocess of thought directly by means of the first figure I must say:\n\n    “All brutes are irrational;\n    Some beings that can speak are brutes,”\n\nwhich is clearly not the natural course of thought; indeed the conclusion\nwhich would then follow, “Some beings that can speak are irrational,”\nwould have to be converted in order to preserve the conclusion which the\nthird figure gives of itself, and at which the whole course of thought has\naimed. Let us take another example:\n\n    All alkalis float in water;\n    All alkalis are metals:\n    Therefore some metals float in water.\n\n                 [Alkalis and Metals overlapping circles]\n\n                                 Figure 1\n\n              [Metals circle with Alkalis circle inside it]\n\n                                 Figure 2\n\nWhen this is transposed into the first figure the minor must be converted,\nand thus runs: “Some metals are alkalis.” It therefore merely asserts that\nsome metals lie in the sphere “alkalis,” thus [Figure 1], while our actual\nknowledge is that all alkalis lie in the sphere “metals,” thus [Figure 2]:\nIt follows that if the first figure is to be regarded as the only normal\none, in order to think naturally we would have to think less than we know,\nand to think indefinitely while we know definitely. This assumption has\ntoo much against it. Thus in general it must be denied that when we draw\ninferences in the second and third figures we tacitly convert a\nproposition. On the contrary, the third, and also the second, figure\nexhibits just as rational a process of thought as the first. Let us now\nconsider another example of the other class of the third figure, in which\nthe separableness of two predicates is the result; on account of which one\npremiss must here be negative:\n\n    No Buddhist believes in a God;\n    Some Buddhists are rational:\n    Therefore some rational beings do not believe in a God.\n\nAs in the examples given above the _compatibility_ of two properties is\nthe problem of reflection, now their _separableness_ is its problem, which\nhere also must be decided by comparing them with _one_ subject and showing\nthat _one_ of them is present in it without the _other_. Thus the end is\ndirectly attained, while by means of the first figure it could only be\nattained indirectly. For in order to reduce the syllogism to the first\nfigure we must convert the minor, and therefore say: “Some rational beings\nare Buddhists,” which would be only a faulty expression of its meaning,\nwhich really is: “Some Buddhists are yet certainly rational.”\n\nAs the guiding principle of this figure I therefore give: for the\naffirmative moods: _Ejusdem rei notœ, modo sit altera universalis, sibi\ninvicem sunt notœ particulares_; and for the negative moods: _Nota rei\ncompetens, notœ eidem repugnanti, particulariter repugnat, modo sit altera\nuniversalis_. Translated: If two predicates are affirmed of one subject,\nand at least one of them universally, they are also affirmed of each other\nparticularly; and, on the contrary, they are denied of each other\nparticularly whenever one of them contradicts the subject of which the\nother is affirmed; provided always that either the contradiction or the\naffirmation be universal.\n\nIn the _fourth figure_ the subject of the major has to be compared with\nthe predicate of the minor; but in the conclusion they must both exchange\ntheir value and position, so that what was the subject of the major\nappears as the predicate of the conclusion, and what was the predicate of\nthe minor appears as the subject of the conclusion. By this it becomes\napparent that this figure is merely the _first_, wilfully turned upside\ndown, and by no means the expression of a real process of thought natural\nto the reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the first three figures are the ectypes of three real\nand essentially different operations of thought. They have this in common,\nthat they consist in the comparison of two judgments; but such a\ncomparison only becomes fruitful when these judgments have _one_\nconception in common. If we present the premisses to our imagination under\nthe sensible form of two rods, we can think of this conception as a clasp\nthat links them to each other; indeed in lecturing one might provide\noneself with such rods. On the other hand, the three figures are\ndistinguished by this, that those judgments are compared either with\nreference to the subjects of both, or to the predicates of both, or\nlastly, with reference to the subject of the one and the predicate of the\nother. Since now every conception has the property of being subject or\npredicate only because it is already part of a judgment, this confirms my\nview that in the syllogism only judgments are primarily compared, and\nconceptions only because they are parts of judgments. In the comparison of\ntwo judgments, however, the essential question is, in _respect of what_\nare they compared? not _by what means_ are they compared? The former\nconsists of the concepts which are different in the two judgments; the\nlatter consists of the middle, that is, the conception which is identical\nin both. It is therefore not the right point of view which Lambert, and\nindeed really Aristotle, and almost all the moderns have taken in starting\nfrom the _middle_ in the analysis of syllogisms, and making it the\nprincipal matter and its position the essential characteristic of the\nsyllogisms. On the contrary, its role is only secondary, and its position\na consequence of the logical value of the conceptions which are really to\nbe compared in the syllogism. These may be compared to two substances\nwhich are to be chemically tested, and the middle to the reagent by which\nthey are tested. It therefore always takes the place which the conceptions\nto be compared leave vacant, and does not appear again in the conclusion.\nIt is selected according to our knowledge of its relation to both the\nconceptions and its suitableness for the place it has to take up.\nTherefore in many cases we can change it at pleasure for another without\naffecting the syllogism. For example, in the syllogism:\n\n    All men are mortal;\n    Caius is a man:\n\nI can exchange the middle “man” for “animal existence.” In the syllogism:\n\n    All diamonds are stones;\n    All diamonds are combustible:\n\nI can exchange the middle “diamond” for “anthracite.” As an external mark\nby which we can recognise at once the figure of a syllogism the middle is\ncertainly very useful. But as the fundamental characteristic of a thing\nwhich is to be explained, we must take what is essential to it; and what\nis essential here is, whether we place two propositions together in order\nto compare their predicates or their subjects, or the predicate of the one\nand the subject of the other.\n\nTherefore, in order as premisses to yield a conclusion, two judgments must\nhave a conception in common; further, they must not both be negative, nor\nboth particular; and lastly, in the case in which the conceptions to be\ncompared are the subjects of both, they must not both be affirmative.\n\nThe voltaic pile may be regarded as a sensible image of the syllogism. Its\npoint of indifference, at the centre, represents the middle, which holds\ntogether the two premisses, and by virtue of which they have the power of\nyielding a conclusion. The two different conceptions, on the other hand,\nwhich are really what is to be compared, are represented by the two\nopposite poles of the pile. Only because these are brought together by\nmeans of their two conducting wires, which represent the copulas of the\ntwo judgments, is the spark emitted upon their contact—the new light of\nthe conclusion.\n\nChapter XI.(22) On Rhetoric.\n\nEloquence is the faculty of awakening in others our view of a thing, or\nour opinion about it, of kindling in them our feeling concerning it, and\nthus putting them in sympathy with us. And all this by conducting the\nstream of our thought into their minds, through the medium of words, with\nsuch force as to carry their thought from the direction it has already\ntaken, and sweep it along with ours in its course. The more their previous\ncourse of thought differs from ours, the greater is this achievement. From\nthis it is easily understood how personal conviction and passion make a\nman eloquent; and in general, eloquence is more the gift of nature than\nthe work of art; yet here, also, art will support nature.\n\nIn order to convince another of a truth which conflicts with an error he\nfirmly holds, the first rule to be observed, is an easy and natural one:\n_let the premisses come first, and the conclusion follow_. Yet this rule\nis seldom observed, but reversed; for zeal, eagerness, and dogmatic\npositiveness urge us to proclaim the conclusion loudly and noisily against\nhim who adheres to the opposed error. This easily makes him shy, and now\nhe opposes his will to all reasons and premisses, knowing already to what\nconclusion they lead. Therefore we ought rather to keep the conclusion\ncompletely concealed, and only advance the premisses distinctly, fully,\nand in different lights. Indeed, if possible, we ought not to express the\nconclusion at all. It will come necessarily and regularly of its own\naccord into the reason of the hearers, and the conviction thus born in\nthemselves will be all the more genuine, and will also be accompanied by\nself-esteem instead of shame. In difficult cases we may even assume the\nair of desiring to arrive at a quite opposite conclusion from that which\nwe really have in view. An example of this is the famous speech of Antony\nin Shakspeare’s “Julius Cæsar.”\n\nIn defending a thing many persons err by confidently advancing everything\nimaginable that can be said for it, mixing up together what is true, half\ntrue, and merely plausible. But the false is soon recognised, or at any\nrate felt, and throws suspicion also upon the cogent and true arguments\nwhich were brought forward along with it. Give then the true and weighty\npure and alone, and beware of defending a truth with inadequate, and\ntherefore, since they are set up as adequate, sophistical reasons; for the\nopponent upsets these, and thereby gains the appearance of having upset\nthe truth itself which was supported by them, that is, he makes _argumenta\nad hominem_ hold good as _argumenta ad rem_. The Chinese go, perhaps, too\nfar the other way, for they have the saying: “He who is eloquent and has a\nsharp tongue may always leave half of a sentence unspoken; and he who has\nright on his side may confidently yield three-tenths of his assertion.”\n\nChapter XII.(23) On The Doctrine Of Science.\n\nFrom the analysis of the different functions of our intellect given in the\nwhole of the preceding chapters, it is clear that for a correct use of it,\neither in a theoretical or a practical reference, the following conditions\nare demanded: (1.) The correct apprehension through perception of the real\nthings taken into consideration, and of all their essential properties and\nrelations, thus of all _data_. (2.) The construction of correct\nconceptions out of these; thus the connotation of those properties under\ncorrect abstractions, which now become the material of the subsequent\nthinking. (3.) The comparison of those conceptions both with the perceived\nobject and among themselves, and with the rest of our store of\nconceptions, so that correct judgments, pertinent to the matter in hand,\nand fully comprehending and exhausting it, may proceed from them; thus the\nright _estimation_ of the matter. (4.) The placing together or\n_combination_ of those judgments as the premisses of _syllogisms_. This\nmay be done very differently according to the choice and arrangement of\nthe judgments, and yet the actual _result_ of the whole operation\nprimarily depends upon it. What is really of importance here is that from\namong so many possible combinations of those different judgments which\nhave to do with the matter free deliberation should hit upon the very ones\nwhich serve the purpose and are decisive. But if in the first function,\nthat is, in the apprehension through perception of the things and\nrelations, any single essential point has been overlooked, the correctness\nof all the succeeding operations of the mind cannot prevent the result\nfrom being false; for there lie the data, the material of the whole\ninvestigation. Without the certainty that these are correctly and\ncompletely collected, one ought to abstain, in important matters, from any\ndefinite decision.\n\nA conception is _correct_; a judgment is _true_; a body is _real_; and a\nrelation is _evident_. A proposition of immediate certainty is an _axiom_.\nOnly the fundamental principles of logic, and those of mathematics drawn\n_a priori_ from intuition or perception, and finally also the law of\ncausality, have immediate certainty. A proposition of indirect certainty\nis a maxim, and that by means of which it obtains its certainty is the\nproof. If immediate certainty is attributed to a proposition which has no\nsuch certainty, this is a _petitio principii_. A proposition which appeals\ndirectly to the empirical perception is an _assertion_: to confront it\nwith such perception demands judgment. Empirical perception can primarily\nafford us only _particular_, not universal truths. Through manifold\nrepetition and confirmation such truths indeed obtain a certain\nuniversality also, but it is only comparative and precarious, because it\nis still always open to attack. But if a proposition has absolute\nuniversality, the perception to which it appeals is not empirical but _a\npriori_. Thus Logic and Mathematics alone are absolutely certain sciences;\nbut they really teach us only what we already knew beforehand. For they\nare merely explanations of that of which we are conscious _a priori_, the\nforms of our own knowledge, the one being concerned with the forms of\nthinking, the other with those of perceiving. Therefore we spin them\nentirely out of ourselves. All other scientific knowledge is empirical.\n\nA proof proves _too much_ if it extends to things or cases of which that\nwhich is to be proved clearly does not hold good; therefore it is refuted\napagogically by these. The _deductio ad absurdum_ properly consists in\nthis, that we take a false assertion which has been made as the major\nproposition of a syllogism, then add to it a correct minor, and arrive at\na conclusion which clearly contradicts facts of experience or\nunquestionable truths. But by some round-about way such a refutation must\nbe possible of every false doctrine. For the defender of this will yet\ncertainly recognise and admit some truth or other, and then the\nconsequences of this, and on the other hand those of the false assertion,\nmust be followed out until we arrive at two propositions which directly\ncontradict each other. We find many examples in Plato of this beautiful\nartifice of genuine dialectic.\n\nA _correct hypothesis_ is nothing more than the true and complete\nexpression of the present fact, which the originator of the hypothesis has\nintuitively apprehended in its real nature and inner connection. For it\ntells us only what really takes place here.\n\nThe opposition of the _analytical_ and _synthetical_ methods we find\nalready indicated by Aristotle, yet perhaps first distinctly described by\nProclus, who says quite correctly: “Μεθοδοι δε παραδιδονται; καλλιστη μεν\nἡ δια της αναλυσεως επ᾽ αρχην ὁμολογουμενην αναγουσα το ζητουμενον; ἡν και\nΠλατων, ὡς φασι, Λαοδαμαντι παρεδωκεν. κ.τ.λ.” (_Methodi traduntur\nsequentes: pulcherrima quidem ea, quæ per analysin quæsitum refert ad\nprincipium, de quo jam convenit; quam etiam Plato Laodamanti tradidisse\ndicitur._) “_In Primum Euclidis Librum_,” L. iii. Certainly the analytical\nmethod consists in referring what is given to an admitted principle; the\nsynthetical method, on the contrary, in deduction from such a principle.\nThey are therefore analogous to the επαγωγη and απαγωγη explained in\nchapter ix.; only the latter are not used to establish propositions, but\nalways to overthrow them. The analytical method proceeds from the facts;\nthe particular, to the principle or rule; the universal, or from the\nconsequents to the reasons; the other conversely. Therefore it would be\nmuch more correct to call them _the inductive and the deductive methods_,\nfor the customary names are unsuitable and do not fully express the\nthings.\n\nIf a philosopher tries to begin by thinking out the methods in accordance\nwith which he will philosophise, he is like a poet who first writes a\nsystem of æsthetics in order to poetise in accordance with it. Both of\nthem may be compared to a man who first sings himself a tune and\nafterwards dances to it. The thinking mind must find its way from original\ntendency. Rule and application, method and achievement, must, like matter\nand form, be inseparable. But after we have reached the goal we may\nconsider the path we have followed. Æsthetics and methodology are, from\ntheir nature, younger than poetry and philosophy; as grammar is younger\nthan language, thorough bass younger than music, and logic younger than\nthought.\n\nThis is a fitting place to make, in passing, a remark by means of which I\nshould like to check a growing evil while there is yet time. That Latin\nhas ceased to be the language of all scientific investigations has the\ndisadvantage that there is no longer an immediately common scientific\nliterature for the whole of Europe, but national literatures. And thus\nevery scholar is primarily limited to a much smaller public, and moreover\nto a public hampered with national points of view and prejudices. Then he\nmust now learn the four principal European languages, as well as the two\nancient languages. In this it will be a great assistance to him that the\n_termini technici_ of all sciences (with the exception of mineralogy) are,\nas an inheritance from our predecessors, Latin or Greek. Therefore all\nnations wisely retain these. Only the Germans have hit upon the\nunfortunate idea of wishing to Germanise the _termini technici_ of all the\nsciences. This has two great disadvantages. First, the foreign and also\nthe German scholar is obliged to learn all the technical terms of his\nscience twice, which, when there are many—for example, in Anatomy—is an\nincredibly tiresome and lengthy business. If the other nations were not in\nthis respect wiser than the Germans, we would have the trouble of learning\nevery _terminus technicus_ five times. If the Germans carry this further,\nforeign men of learning will leave their books altogether unread; for\nbesides this fault they are for the most part too diffuse, and are written\nin a careless, bad, and often affected and objectionable style, and\nbesides are generally conceived with a rude disregard of the reader and\nhis requirements. Secondly, those Germanised forms of the _termini\ntechnici_ are almost throughout long, patched-up, stupidly chosen,\nawkward, jarring words, not clearly separated from the rest of the\nlanguage, which therefore impress themselves with difficulty upon the\nmemory, while the Greek and Latin expressions chosen by the ancient and\nmemorable founders of the sciences possess the whole of the opposite good\nqualities, and easily impress themselves on the memory by their sonorous\nsound. What an ugly, harsh-sounding word, for instance, is “_Stickstoff_”\ninstead of _azot_! “_Verbum_,” “_substantiv_,” “_adjectiv_,” are\nremembered and distinguished more easily than “_Zeitwort_,” “_Nennwort_,”\n“_Beiwort_,” or even “_Umstandswort_” instead of “_adverbium_.” In Anatomy\nit is quite unsupportable, and moreover vulgar and low. Even “_Pulsader_”\nand “_Blutader_” are more exposed to momentary confusion than “_Arterie_”\nand “_Vene_;” but utterly bewildering are such expressions as\n“_Fruchthälter_,” “_Fruchtgang_,” and “_Fruchtleiter_” instead of\n“_uterus_,” “_vagina_,” and “_tuba Faloppii_,” which yet every doctor must\nknow, and which he will find sufficient in all European languages. In the\nsame way “_Speiche_” and “_Ellenbogenröhre_” instead of “_radius_” and\n“_ulna_,” which all Europe has understood for thousands of years.\nWherefore then this clumsy, confusing, drawling, and awkward Germanising?\nNot less objectionable is the translation of the technical terms in Logic,\nin which our gifted professors of philosophy are the creators of a new\nterminology, and almost every one of them has his own. With G. E. Schulze,\nfor example, the subject is called “_Grundbegriff_,” the predicate\n“_Beilegungsbegriff_;” then there are “_Beilegungsschlüsse_,”\n“_Voraussetzungsschlüsse_,” and “_Entgegensetzungsschlüsse_;” the\njudgments have “_Grösse_,” “_Beschaffenheit_,” “_Verhältniss_,” and\n“_Zuverlässigkeit_,” _i.e._, quantity, quality, relation, and modality.\nThe same perverse influence of this Germanising mania is to be found in\nall the sciences. The Latin and Greek expressions have the further\nadvantage that they stamp the scientific conception as such, and\ndistinguish it from the words of common intercourse, and the ideas which\ncling to them through association; while, for example, “_Speisebrei_”\ninstead of _chyme_ seems to refer to the food of little children, and\n“_Lungensack_” instead of _pleura_, and “_Herzbeutel_” instead of\n_pericardium_ seem to have been invented by butchers rather than\nanatomists. Besides this, the most immediate necessity of learning the\nancient languages depends upon the old _termini technici_, and they are\nmore and more in danger of being neglected through the use of living\nlanguages in learned investigations. But if it comes to this, if the\nspirit of the ancients bound up with their languages disappears from a\nliberal education, then coarseness, insipidity, and vulgarity will take\npossession of the whole of literature. For the works of the ancients are\nthe pole-star of every artistic or literary effort; if it sets they are\nlost. Even now we can observe from the miserable and puerile style of most\nwriters that they have never written Latin.(24) The study of the classical\nauthors is very properly called the study of _Humanity_, for through it\nthe student first becomes a _man_ again, for he enters into the world\nwhich was still free from all the absurdities of the Middle Ages and of\nromanticism, which afterwards penetrated so deeply into mankind in Europe\nthat even now every one comes into the world covered with it, and has\nfirst to strip it off simply to become a man again. Think not that your\nmodern wisdom can ever supply the place of that initiation into manhood;\nye are not, like the Greeks and Romans, born freemen, unfettered sons of\nnature. Ye are first the sons and heirs of the barbarous Middle Ages and\nof their madness, of infamous priestcraft, and of half-brutal,\nhalf-childish chivalry. Though both now gradually approach their end, yet\nye cannot yet stand on your own feet. Without the school of the ancients\nyour literature will degenerate into vulgar gossip and dull philistinism.\nThus for all these reasons it is my well-intended counsel that an end be\nput at once to the Germanising mania condemned above.\n\nI shall further take the opportunity of denouncing here the disorder which\nfor some years has been introduced into German orthography in an\nunprecedented manner. Scribblers of every species have heard something of\nconciseness of expression, but do not know that this consists in the\ncareful omission of everything superfluous (to which, it is true, the\nwhole of their writings belong), but imagine they can arrive at it by\nclipping the words as swindlers clip coin; and every syllable which\nappears to them superfluous, because they do not feel its value, they cut\noff without more ado. For example, our ancestors, with true tact, said\n“_Beweis_” and “_Verweis_;” but, on the other hand, “_Nachweisung_.” The\nfine distinction analogous to that between “_Versuch_” and “_Versuchung_,”\n“_Betracht_” and “_Betrachtung_,” is not perceptible to dull ears and\nthick skulls; therefore they have invented the word “_Nachweis_,” which\nhas come at once into general use, for this only requires that an idea\nshould be thoroughly awkward and a blunder very gross. Accordingly a\nsimilar amputation has already been proposed in innumerable words; for\nexample, instead of “_Untersuchung_” is written “_Untersuch_;” nay, even\ninstead of “_allmälig_,” “_mälig_;” instead of “_beinahe_,” “_nahe_;”\ninstead of “_beständig_,” “_ständig_.” If a Frenchman took upon himself to\nwrite “_près_” instead of “_presque_,” or if an Englishman wrote “_most_”\ninstead of “_almost_,” they would be laughed at by every one as fools; but\nin Germany whoever does this sort of thing passes for a man of\noriginality. Chemists already write “_löslich_” and “_unlöslich_” instead\nof “_unauflöslich_,” and if the grammarians do not rap them over the\nknuckles they will rob the language of a valuable word. Knots,\nshoe-strings, and also conglomerates of which the cement is softened, and\nall analogous things are “_löslich_” (can be loosed); but what is\n“_auflöslich_” (soluble), on the other hand, is whatever vanishes in a\nliquid, like salt in water. “_Auflösen_” (to dissolve) is the _terminus ad\nhoc_, which says this and nothing else, marking out a definite conception;\nbut our acute improvers of the language wish to empty it into the general\nrinsing-pan “_lösen_” (to loosen); they would therefore in consistency be\nobliged to make “_lösen_” also take the place everywhere of “_ablösen_”\n(to relieve, used of guards), “_auslösen_” (to release), “_einlösen_” (to\nredeem), &c., and in these, as in the former case, deprive the language of\ndefiniteness of expression. But to make the language poorer by a word\nmeans to make the thought of the nation poorer by a conception. Yet this\nis the tendency of the united efforts of almost all our writers of books\nfor the last ten or twenty years. For what I have shown here by _one_\nexample can be supported by a hundred others, and the meanest stinting of\nsyllables prevails like a disease. The miserable wretches actually count\nthe letters, and do not hesitate to mutilate a word, or to use one in a\nfalse sense, whenever by doing so they can gain two letters. He who is\ncapable of no new thoughts will at least bring new words to market, and\nevery ink-slinger regards it as his vocation to improve the language.\nJournalists practise this most shamelessly; and since their papers, on\naccount of the trivial nature of their \n\nIn my essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 51, I already\nproposed a first _classification of the sciences_ in accordance with the\nform of the principle of sufficient reason which reigns in them; and I\nalso touched upon it again in §§ 7 and 15 of the first volume of this\nwork. I will give here a small attempt at such a classification, which\nwill yet no doubt be susceptible of much improvement and perfecting:—\n\n    I. Pure _a priori_ Sciences.\n\n    1.

This axiom asserts, and indeed supports its\nassertion by the indirect evidence of a third intersecting line, that two\nlines inclining towards each other (for that is just the meaning of “less\nthan two right angles”) if produced far enough must meet—a truth which is\nsupposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore\nrequires a demonstration. Such a demonstration, however, cannot be\nproduced, just because there is nothing that is not immediate. This\nscruple of conscience reminds me of Schiller’s question of law:—\n\n“For years I have used my nose for smelling. Have I, then, actually a\nright to it that can be proved?” Indeed it seems to me that the logical\nmethod is hereby reduced to absurdity. Yet it is just through the\ncontroversies about this, together with the vain attempts to prove what is\n_directly_ certain as merely _indirectly_ certain, that the\nself-sufficingness and clearness of intuitive evidence appears in contrast\nwith the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof—a contrast which is\nno less instructive than amusing. The direct certainty is not allowed to\nbe valid here, because it is no mere logical certainty following from the\nconceptions, thus resting only upon the relation of the predicate to the\nsubject, according to the principle of contradiction. That axiom, however,\nis a synthetical proposition _a priori_, and as such has the guarantee of\npure, not empirical, perception, which is just as immediate and certain as\nthe principle of contradiction itself, from which all demonstrations first\nderive their certainty. Ultimately this holds good of every geometrical\ntheorem, and it is quite arbitrary where we draw the line between what is\ndirectly certain and what has first to be demonstrated. It surprises me\nthat the eighth axiom is not rather attacked. “Figures which coincide with\neach other are equal to each other.” For “coinciding with each other” is\neither a mere tautology or something purely empirical which does not\nbelong to pure perception but to external sensuous experience. It\npresupposes that the figures may be moved; but only matter is movable in\nspace. Therefore this appeal to coincidence leaves pure space—the one\nelement of geometry—in order to pass over to what is material and\nempirical.\n\nThe reputed motto of the Platonic lecture-room, “Αγεωμετρητος μηδεις\nεισιτω,” of which mathematicians are so proud, was no doubt inspired by\nthe fact that Plato regarded the geometrical figures as intermediate\nexistences between the eternal Ideas and particular things, as Aristotle\nfrequently mentions in his “Metaphysics” (especially i. c. 6, p. 887, 998,\n_et Scholia_, p. 827, ed. Berol.) Moreover, the opposition between those\nself-existent eternal forms, or Ideas, and the transitory individual\nthings, was most easily made comprehensible in geometrical figures, and\nthereby laid the foundation of the doctrine of Ideas, which is the central\npoint of the philosophy of Plato, and indeed his only serious and decided\ntheoretical dogma. In expounding it, therefore, he started from geometry.\nIn the same sense we are told that he regarded geometry as a preliminary\nexercise through which the mind of the pupil accustomed itself to deal\nwith incorporeal objects, having hitherto in practical life had only to do\nwith corporeal things (_Schol. in Aristot._, p. 12, 15). This, then, is\nthe sense in which Plato recommended geometry to the philosopher; and\ntherefore one is not justified in extending it further. I rather\nrecommend, as an investigation of the influence of mathematics upon our\nmental powers, and their value for scientific culture in general, a very\nthorough and learned discussion, in the form of a review of a book by\nWhewell in the _Edinburgh Review_ of January 1836. Its author, who\nafterwards published it with some other discussions, with his name, is Sir\nW. Hamilton, Professor of Logic and Metaphysics in Scotland. This work has\nalso found a German translator, and has appeared by itself under the\ntitle, “_Ueber den Werth und Unwerth der Mathematik_” _aus dem Englishen_,\n1836. The conclusion the author arrives at is that the value of\nmathematics is only indirect, and lies in the application to ends which\nare only attainable through them; but in themselves mathematics leave the\nmind where they find it, and are by no means conducive to its general\nculture and development, nay, even a decided hindrance. This conclusion is\nnot only proved by thorough dianoiological investigation of the\nmathematical activity of the mind, but is also confirmed by a very learned\naccumulation of examples and authorities. The only direct use which is\nleft to mathematics is that it can accustom restless and unsteady minds to\nfix their attention. Even Descartes, who was yet himself famous as a\nmathematician, held the same opinion with regard to mathematics. In the\n“_Vie de Descartes par Baillet_,” 1693, it is said, Liv. ii. c. 6, p. 54:\n“_Sa propre expérience l’avait convaincu du peu d’utilité des\nmathématiques, surtout lorsqu’on ne les cultive que pour elles mêmes....\nIl ne voyait rien de moins solide, que de s’occuper de nombres tout\nsimples et de figures imaginaires_,” &c.\n\nChapter XIV. On The Association Of Ideas.\n\nThe presence of ideas and thoughts in our consciousness is as strictly\nsubordinated to the principle of sufficient reason in its different forms\nas the movement of bodies to the law of causality. It is just as little\npossible that a thought can appear in the mind without an occasion as that\na body can be set in motion without a cause. Now this occasion is either\n_external_, thus an impression of the senses, or _internal_, thus itself\nalso a thought which introduces another thought by means of _association_.\nThis again depends either upon a relation of reason and consequent between\nthe two; or upon similarity, even mere analogy; or lastly upon the\ncircumstance that they were both first apprehended at the same time, which\nagain may have its ground in the proximity in space of their objects. The\nlast two cases are denoted by the word _à propos_. The predominance of one\nof these three bonds of association of thoughts over the others is\ncharacteristic of the intellectual worth of the man. The first named will\npredominate in thoughtful and profound minds, the second in witty,\ningenious, and poetical minds, and the third in minds of limited capacity.\nNot less characteristic is the degree of facility with which one thought\nrecalls others that stand in any kind of relation to it: this constitutes\nthe activeness of the mind. But the impossibility of the appearance of a\nthought without its sufficient occasion, even when there is the strongest\ndesire to call it up, is proved by all the cases in which we weary\nourselves in vain to _recollect_ something, and go through the whole store\nof our thoughts in order to find any one that may be associated with the\none we seek; if we find the former, the latter is also found. Whoever\nwishes to call up something in his memory first seeks for a thread with\nwhich it is connected by the association of thoughts. Upon this depends\nmnemonics: it aims at providing us with easily found occasioners or causes\nfor all the conceptions, thoughts, or words which are to be preserved. But\nthe worst of it is that these occasioners themselves have first to be\nrecalled, and this again requires an occasioner. How much the occasion\naccomplishes in memory may be shown in this way. If we have read in a book\nof anecdotes say fifty anecdotes, and then have laid it aside, immediately\nafterwards we will sometimes be unable to recollect a single one of them.\nBut if the occasion comes, or if a thought occurs to us which has any\nanalogy with one of those anecdotes, it immediately comes back to us; and\nso with the whole fifty as opportunity offers. The same thing holds good\nof all that we read. Our immediate remembrance of words, that is, our\nremembrance of them without the assistance of mnemonic contrivances, and\nwith it our whole faculty of speech, ultimately depends upon the direct\nassociation of thoughts. For the learning of language consists in this,\nthat once for all we so connect a conception with a word that this word\nwill always occur to us along with this conception, and this conception\nwill always occur to us along with this word. We have afterwards to repeat\nthe same process in learning every new language; yet if we learn a\nlanguage for passive and not for active use—that is, to read, but not to\nspeak, as, for example, most of us learn Greek—then the connection is\none-sided, for the conception occurs to us along with the word, but the\nword does not always occur to us along with the conception. The same\nprocedure as in language becomes apparent in the particular case, in the\nlearning of every new proper name. But sometimes we do not trust ourselves\nto connect directly the name of _this_ person, or town, river, mountain,\nplant, animal, &c., with the thought of each so firmly that it will call\neach of them up of itself; and then we assist ourselves mnemonically, and\nconnect the image of the person or thing with any perceptible quality the\nname of which occurs in that of the person or thing. Yet this is only a\ntemporary prop to lean on; later we let it drop, for the association of\nthoughts becomes an immediate support.\n\nThe search of memory for a clue shows itself in a peculiar manner in the\ncase of a dream which we have forgotten on awaking, for in this case we\nseek in vain for that which a few minutes before occupied our minds with\nthe strength of the clearest present, but now has entirely disappeared. We\ngrasp at any lingering impression by which may hang the clue that by\nvirtue of association would call that dream back again into our\nconsciousness. According to Kieser, “_Tellurismus_,” Bd. ii. § 271, memory\neven of what passed in magnetic-somnambular sleep may possibly sometimes\nbe aroused by a sensible sign found when awake. It depends upon the same\nimpossibility of the appearance of a thought without its occasion that if\nwe propose to do anything at a definite time, this can only take place if\nwe either think of nothing else till then, or if at the determined time we\nare _reminded_ of it by something, which may either be an external\nimpression arranged beforehand or a thought which is itself again brought\nabout in the regular way. Both, then, belong to the class of motives.\nEvery morning when we awake our consciousness is a _tabula rasa_, which,\nhowever, quickly fills itself again. First it is the surroundings of the\nprevious evening which now reappear, and remind us of what we thought in\nthese surroundings; to this the events of the previous day link themselves\non; and so one thought rapidly recalls the others, till all that occupied\nus yesterday is there again. Upon the fact that this takes place properly\ndepends the health of the mind, as opposed to madness, which, as is shown\nin the third book, consists in the existence of great blanks in the memory\nof past events. But how completely sleep breaks the thread of memory, so\nthat each morning it has to be taken up again, we see in particular cases\nof the incompleteness of this operation. For example, sometimes we cannot\nrecall in the morning a melody which the night before ran in our head till\nwe were tired of it.\n\nThe cases in which a thought or a picture of the fancy suddenly came into\nour mind without any conscious occasion seem to afford an exception to\nwhat has been said. Yet this is for the most part an illusion, which rests\non the fact that the occasion was so trifling and the thought itself so\nvivid and interesting, that the former is instantly driven out of\nconsciousness. Yet sometimes the cause of such an instantaneous appearance\nof an idea may be an internal physical impression either of the parts of\nthe brain on each other or of the organic nervous system upon the brain.\n\nIn general our internal process of thought is in reality not so simple as\nthe theory of it; for here it is involved in many ways. To make the matter\nclear to our imagination, let us compare our consciousness to a sheet of\nwater of some depth. Then the distinctly conscious thoughts are merely the\nsurface; while, on the other hand, the indistinct thoughts, the feelings,\nthe after sensation of perceptions and of experience generally, mingled\nwith the special disposition of our own will, which is the kernel of our\nbeing, is the mass of the water. Now the mass of the whole consciousness\nis more or less, in proportion to the intellectual activity, in constant\nmotion, and what rise to the surface, in consequence of this, are the\nclear pictures of the fancy or the distinct, conscious thoughts expressed\nin words and the resolves of the will. The whole process of our thought\nand purpose seldom lies on the surface, that is, consists in a combination\nof distinctly thought judgments; although we strive against this in order\nthat we may be able to explain our thought to ourselves and others. But\nordinarily it is in the obscure depths of the mind that the rumination of\nthe materials received from without takes place, through which they are\nworked up into thoughts; and it goes on almost as unconsciously as the\nconversion of nourishment into the humours and substance of the body.\nHence it is that we can often give no account of the origin of our deepest\nthoughts. They are the birth of our mysterious inner life. Judgments,\nthoughts, purposes, rise from out that deep unexpectedly and to our own\nsurprise. A letter brings us unlooked-for and important news, in\nconsequence of which our thoughts and motives are disordered; we get rid\nof the matter for the present, and think no more about it; but next day,\nor on the third or fourth day after, the whole situation sometimes stands\ndistinctly before us, with what we have to do in the circumstances.\nConsciousness is the mere surface of our mind, of which, as of the earth,\nwe do not know the inside, but only the crust.\n\nBut in the last instance, or in the secret of our inner being, what sets\nin activity the association of thought itself, the laws of which were set\nforth above, is the _will_, which urges its servant the intellect,\naccording to the measure of its powers, to link thought to thought, to\nrecall the similar, the contemporaneous, to recognise reasons and\nconsequents. For it is to the interest of the will that, in general, one\nshould think, so that one may be well equipped for all cases that may\narise. Therefore the form of the principle of sufficient reason which\ngoverns the association of thoughts and keeps it active is ultimately the\nlaw of motivation. For that which rules the sensorium, and determines it\nto follow the analogy or other association of thoughts in this or that\ndirection, is the will of the thinking subject. Now just as here the laws\nof the connection of ideas subsist only upon the basis of the will, so\nalso in the real world the causal connection of bodies really subsists\nonly upon the basis of the will, which manifests itself in the phenomena\nof this world. On this account the explanation from causes is never\nabsolute and exhaustive, but leads back to forces of nature as their\ncondition, and the inner being of the latter is just the will as thing in\nitself. In saying this, however, I have certainly anticipated the\nfollowing book.\n\nBut because now the _outward_ (sensible) occasions of the presence of our\nideas, just as well as the _inner_ occasions (those of association), and\nboth independently of each other, constantly affect the consciousness,\nthere arise from this the frequent interruptions of our course of thought,\nwhich introduce a certain cutting up and confusion of our thinking. This\nbelongs to its imperfections which cannot be explained away, and which we\nshall now consider in a separate chapter.\n\nChapter XV. On The Essential Imperfections Of The Intellect.\n\nOur self-consciousness has not space but only time as its form, and\ntherefore we do not think in three dimensions, as we perceive, but only in\n_one_, thus in a line, without breadth or depth. This is the source of the\ngreatest of the essential imperfections of our intellect. We can know all\nthings only in _succession_, and can become conscious of only one at a\ntime, indeed even of this one only under the condition that for the time\nwe forget everything else, thus are absolutely unconscious of everything\nelse, so that for the time it ceases to exist as far as we are concerned.\nIn respect of this quality our intellect may be compared to a telescope\nwith a very narrow field of vision; just because our consciousness is not\nstationary but fleeting. The intellect apprehends only successively, and\nin order to grasp one thing must let another go, retaining nothing but\ntraces of it, which are ever becoming weaker. The thought which is vividly\npresent to me now must after a little while have escaped me altogether;\nand if a good night’s sleep intervene, it may be that I shall never find\nit again, unless it is connected with my personal interests, that is, with\nmy will, which always commands the field.\n\nUpon this imperfection of the intellect depends the disconnected and often\n_fragmentary nature_ of our course of thought, which I have already\ntouched on at the close of last chapter; and from this again arises the\nunavoidable _distraction_ of our thinking. Sometimes external impressions\nof sense throng in upon it, disturbing and interrupting it, forcing\ndifferent kinds of things upon it every moment; sometimes _one_ thought\ndraws in _another_ by the bond of association, and is now itself dislodged\nby it; sometimes, lastly, the intellect itself is not capable of fixing\nitself very long and continuously at a time upon _one_ thought, but as the\neye when it gazes long at one object is soon unable to see it any more\ndistinctly, because the outlines run into each other and become confused,\nuntil finally all is obscure, so through long-continued reflection upon\none subject our thinking also is gradually confused, becomes dull, and\nends in complete stupor. Therefore after a certain time, which varies with\nthe individual, we must for the present give up every meditation or\ndeliberation which has had the fortune to remain undisturbed, but yet has\nnot been brought to an end, even if it concerns a matter which is most\nimportant and pertinent to us; and we must dismiss from our consciousness\nthe subject which interests us so much, however heavily our anxiety about\nit may weigh upon us, in order to occupy ourselves now with insignificant\nand indifferent things. During this time that important subject no longer\nexists for us; it is like the heat in cold water, _latent_. If now we\nresume it again at another time, we approach it like a new thing, with\nwhich we become acquainted anew, although more quickly, and the agreeable\nor disagreeable impression of it is also produced anew upon our will. We\nourselves, however, do not come back quite unchanged. For with the\nphysical composition of the humours and tension of the nerves, which\nconstantly changes with the hours, days, and years, our mood and point of\nview also changes. Moreover, the different kinds of ideas which have been\nthere in the meantime have left an echo behind them, the tone of which\ninfluences the ideas which follow. Therefore the same thing appears to us\nat different times, in the morning, in the evening, at mid-day, or on\nanother day, often very different; opposite views of it now press upon\neach other and increase our doubt. Hence we speak of sleeping upon a\nmatter, and for important determinations we demand a long time for\nconsideration. Now, although this quality of our intellect, as springing\nfrom its weakness, has its evident disadvantages, yet, on the other hand,\nit affords the advantage that after the distraction and the physical\nchange we return to our subject as comparatively new beings, fresh and\nstrange, and thus are able to see it repeatedly in very different lights.\nFrom all this it is plain that human consciousness and thought is in its\nnature necessarily fragmentary, on account of which the theoretical and\npractical results which are achieved by piecing together such fragments\nare for the most part defective. In this our thinking consciousness is\nlike a magic lantern, in the focus of which only one picture can appear at\na time, and each, even if it represents the noblest objects, must yet soon\npass away in order to make room for others of a different, and even most\nvulgar, description. In practical matters the most important plans and\nresolutions are formed in general; but others are subordinated to these as\nmeans to an end, and others again are subordinated to these, and so on\ndown to the particular case that has to be carried out _in concreto_. They\ndo not, however, come to be carried out in the order of their dignity, but\nwhile we are occupied with plans which are great and general, we have to\ncontend with the most trifling details and the cares of the moment. In\nthis way our consciousness becomes still more desultory. In general,\ntheoretical occupations of the mind unfit us for practical affairs, and\n_vice versâ_.\n\nIn consequence of the inevitably distracted and fragmentary nature of all\nour thinking, which has been pointed out, and the mingling of ideas of\ndifferent kinds thereby introduced, to which even the noblest human minds\nare subject, we really have only _half a consciousness_ with which to\ngrope about in the labyrinth of our life and the obscurity of our\ninvestigations; bright moments sometimes illuminate our path like\nlightning. But what is to be expected of heads of which even the wisest is\nevery night the scene of the strangest and most senseless dreams, and\nwhich has to take up its meditations again on awakening from these?\nClearly a consciousness which is subject to such great limitations is\nlittle suited for solving the riddle of the world; and such an endeavour\nwould necessarily appear strange and pitiful to a being of a higher order\nwhose intellect had not time as its form, and whose thinking had thus true\ncompleteness and unity. Indeed it is really wonderful that we are not\ncompletely confused by the very heterogeneous mixture of ideas and\nfragments of thought of every kind which are constantly crossing each\nother in our minds, but are yet always able to see our way again and make\neverything agree together. Clearly there must exist a simpler thread upon\nwhich everything ranges itself together: but what is this? Memory alone is\nnot sufficient, for it has essential limitations of which I shall speak\nshortly, and besides this, it is exceedingly imperfect and untrustworthy.\nThe _logical ego_ or even the _transcendental synthetic unity of\napperception_ are expressions and explanations which will not easily serve\nto make the matter comprehensible; they will rather suggest to many:\n\n    “’Tis true your beard is curly, yet it will not draw you the\n    bolt.”\n\nKant’s proposition, “The _I think_ must accompany all our ideas,” is\ninsufficient; for the “I” is an unknown quantity, _i.e._, it is itself a\nsecret. That which gives unity and connection to consciousness in that it\nruns through all its ideas, and is thus its substratum, its permanent\nsupporter, cannot itself be conditioned by consciousness, therefore cannot\nbe an idea. Rather it must be the _prius_ of consciousness, and the root\nof the tree of which that is the fruit. This, I say, is the _will_. It\nalone is unchangeable and absolutely identical, and has brought forth\nconsciousness for its own ends. Therefore it is also the will which gives\nit unity and holds together all its ideas and thoughts, accompanying them\nlike a continuous harmony. Without it the intellect would no longer have\nthe unity of consciousness, as a mirror in which now this and now that\nsuccessively presents itself, or at the most only so much as a convex\nmirror whose rays unite in an imaginary point behind its surface. But the\n_will_ alone is that which is permanent and unchangeable in consciousness.\nIt is the will which holds together all thoughts and ideas as means to its\nends, and tinges them with the colour of its own character, its mood, and\nits interests, commands the attention, and holds in its hand the train of\nmotives whose influence ultimately sets memory and the association of\nideas in activity; at bottom it is the will that is spoken of whenever “I”\nappears in a judgment. Thus it is the true and final point of unity of\nconsciousness, and the bond of all its functions and acts; it does not\nitself, however, belong to the intellect, but is only its root, source,\nand controller.\n\nFrom the _form of time and the single dimension_ of the series of ideas,\non account of which, in order to take up one, the intellect must let all\nthe others fall, there follows not only its distraction, but also its\n_forgetfulness_. Most of what it lets fall it never takes up again;\nespecially since the taking up again is bound to the principle of\nsufficient reason, and thus demands an occasion which the association of\nthoughts and motivation have first to supply; an occasion, however, which\nmay be the more remote and smaller in proportion as our sensibility for it\nis heightened by our interest in the subject. But memory, as I have\nalready shown in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, is not a\nstore-house, but merely a faculty acquired by practice of calling up ideas\nat pleasure, which must therefore constantly be kept in practice by use;\nfor otherwise it will gradually be lost. Accordingly the knowledge even of\nthe learned man exists only _virtualiter_ as an acquired facility in\ncalling up certain ideas; _actualiter_, on the other hand, it also is\nconfined to one idea, and is only conscious of this one at a time. Hence\narises a strange contrast between what he knows _potentiâ_ and what he\nknows _actu_; that is, between his knowledge and what he thinks at any\nmoment: the former is an immense and always somewhat chaotic mass, the\nlatter is a single distinct thought. The relation resembles that between\nthe innumerable stars of the heavens and the limited field of vision of\nthe telescope; it appears in a striking manner when upon some occasion he\nwishes to call distinctly to his remembrance some particular circumstance\nin his knowledge, and time and trouble are required to produce it from\nthat chaos. Rapidity in doing this is a special gift, but is very\ndependent upon day and hour; therefore memory sometimes refuses us its\nservice, even in things which at another time it has readily at hand. This\nconsideration calls us in our studies to strive more to attain to correct\ninsight than to increase our learning, and to lay it to heart that the\n_quality_ of knowledge is more important than its _quantity_. The latter\nimparts to books only thickness, the former thoroughness and also style;\nfor it is an _intensive_ quantity, while the other is merely _extensive_.\nIt consists in the distinctness and completeness of the conceptions,\ntogether with the purity and accuracy of the knowledge of perception which\nforms their foundation; therefore the whole of knowledge in all its parts\nis penetrated by it, and in proportion as it is so is valuable or\ntrifling. With a small quantity, but of good quality, one achieves more\nthan with a very large quantity of bad quality.\n\nThe most perfect and satisfactory knowledge is that of perception, but it\nis limited absolutely to the particular, the individual. The combination\nof the many and the different in _one_ idea is only possible through the\n_conception_, that is, through the omission of the differences; therefore\nthis is a very imperfect manner of presenting things to the mind.\nCertainly the particular also can be directly comprehended as a universal,\nif it is raised to the (Platonic) Idea; but in this process, which I have\nanalysed in the third book, the intellect already passes beyond the limits\nof individuality, and therefore of time; moreover it is only an exception.\n\nThese inner and essential imperfections of the intellect are further\nincreased by a disturbance which, to a certain extent, is external to it,\nbut yet is unceasing—the influence exerted by the will upon all its\noperations whenever it is in any way concerned in their result. Every\npassion, indeed every inclination and aversion, tinges the objects of\nknowledge with its colour. Of most common occurrence is the falsifying of\nknowledge which is brought about by wishes and hopes, for they picture to\nus the scarcely possible as probable and well nigh certain, and make us\nalmost incapable of comprehending what is opposed to it: fear acts in a\nsimilar way; and every preconceived opinion, every partiality, and, as has\nbeen said, every interest, every emotion and inclination of the will, acts\nin an analogous manner.\n\nTo all these imperfections of the intellect we have finally to add this,\nthat it grows old with the brain, that is, like all physiological\nfunctions, it loses its energy in later years, whereby all its\nimperfections are then much increased.\n\nThe defective nature of the intellect here set forth will not, however,\nsurprise us if we look back at its origin and destiny as established by me\nin the second book. Nature has produced it for the service of an\nindividual will. Therefore it is only designed to know things so far as\nthey afford the motives of such a will, but not to fathom them or\ncomprehend their true being. Human intellect is only a higher gradation of\nthe intellect of the brutes; and as this is entirely confined to the\npresent, our intellect also bears strong traces of this limitation,\nTherefore our memory and recollection is something very imperfect. How\nlittle of all that we have done, experienced, learnt, or read, can we\nrecall! And even this little for the most part only laboriously and\nimperfectly. For the same reasons is it so very difficult for us to keep\nourselves free from the impressions of the present. Unconsciousness is the\noriginal and natural condition of all things, and therefore also the basis\nfrom which, in particular species of beings, consciousness results as\ntheir highest efflorescence; wherefore even then unconsciousness always\ncontinues to predominate. Accordingly most existences are without\nconsciousness; but yet they act according to the laws of their nature,\n_i.e._, of their will. Plants have at most a very weak analogue of\nconsciousness; the lowest species of animals only the dawn of it. But even\nafter it has ascended through the whole series of animals to man and his\nreason, the unconsciousness of plants, from which it started, still\nremains the foundation, and may be traced in the necessity for sleep, and\nalso in all those essential and great imperfections, here set forth, of\nevery intellect produced through physiological functions; and of another\nintellect we have no conception.\n\nThe imperfections here proved to be _essential_ to the intellect are\nconstantly increased, however, in particular cases, by _non-essential_\nimperfections. The intellect is never in _every_ respect what it possibly\nmight be. The perfections possible to it are so opposed that they exclude\neach other. Therefore no man can be at once Plato and Aristotle, or\nShakspeare and Newton, or Kant and Goethe. The imperfections of the\nintellect, on the contrary, consort very well together; therefore in\nreality it for the most part remains far below what it might be. Its\nfunctions depend upon so very many conditions, which we can only\ncomprehend as anatomical and physiological, in the _phenomenon_ in which\nalone they are given us, that a decidedly excelling intellect, even in\n_one_ respect alone, is among the rarest of natural phenomena. Therefore\nthe productions of such an intellect are preserved through thousands of\nyears, indeed every relic of such a highly favoured individual becomes a\nmost valuable treasure. From such an intellect down to that which\napproaches imbecility the gradations are innumerable. And primarily, in\nconformity with these gradations, the _mental horizon_ of each of us\nvaries very much from the mere comprehension of the present, which even\nthe brute has, to that which also embraces the next hour, the day, even\nthe morrow, the week, the year, the life, the century, the thousand years,\nup to that of the consciousness which has almost always present, even\nthough obscurely dawning, the horizon of the infinite, and whose thoughts\ntherefore assume a character in keeping with this. Further, that\ndifference among intelligences shows itself in the rapidity of their\nthinking, which is very important, and which may be as different and as\nfinely graduated as that of the points in the radius of a revolving disc.\nThe remoteness of the consequents and reasons to which any one’s thought\ncan extend seems to stand in a certain relation to the rapidity of his\nthinking, for the greatest exertion of thought-power in general can only\nlast quite a short time, and yet only while it lasts can a thought be\nthought out in its complete unity. It therefore amounts to this, how far\nthe intellect can pursue it in so short a time, thus what length of path\nit can travel in it. On the other hand, in the case of some, rapidity may\nbe made up for by the greater duration of that time of perfectly\nconcentrated thought. Probably the slow and lasting thought makes the\nmathematical mind, while rapidity of thought makes the genius. The latter\nis a flight, the former a sure advance upon firm ground, step by step. Yet\neven in the sciences, whenever it is no longer a question of mere\nquantities, but of understanding the nature of phenomena, this last kind\nof thinking is inadequate. This is shown, for example, by Newton’s theory\nof colour, and later by Biot’s nonsense about colour rings, which yet\nagrees with the whole atomistic method of treating light among the French,\nwith its _molécules de lumière_, and in general with their fixed idea of\nreducing everything in nature to mere mechanical effects. Lastly, the\ngreat individual diversity of intelligence we are speaking about shows\nitself excellently in the _degrees of the clearness of understanding_, and\naccordingly in the distinctness of _the whole thinking_. To one man that\nis to understand which to another is only in some degree to observe; the\none is already done and at the goal while the other is only at the\nbeginning; to the one that is the solution which to the other is only the\nproblem. This depends on the _quality of thought_ and knowledge, which was\nalready referred to above. As in rooms the degree of light varies, so does\nit in minds. We can detect this _quality of the whole thought_ as soon as\nwe have read only a few pages of an author. For in doing so we have been\nobliged to understand both with his understanding and in his sense; and\ntherefore before we know all that he has thought we see already how he\nthinks, what is the _formal_ nature, the _texture_ of his thinking, which\nremains the same in everything about which he thinks, and whose expression\nis the train of thought and the style. In this we feel at once the pace,\nthe flexibleness and lightness, even indeed the soaring power of his mind;\nor, on the contrary, its dulness, formality, lameness and leaden quality.\nFor, as language is the expression of the mind of a nation, style is the\nmore immediate expression of the mind of an author than even his\nphysiognomy. We throw a book aside when we observe that in it we enter an\nobscurer region than our own, unless we have to learn from it mere facts,\nnot thoughts. Apart from mere facts, only that author will afford us\nprofit whose understanding is keener and clearer than our own, who\nforwards our thinking instead of hindering it, like the dull mind that\nwill force us to keep pace with the toad-like course of its thought; thus\nthat author with whose mind it gives us sensible relief and assistance\nsometimes to think, by whom we feel ourselves borne where we could not\nhave gone alone. Goethe once said to me that if he read a page of Kant he\nfelt as if he entered a brightly lighted room. Inferior minds are so not\nmerely because they are distorted, and therefore judge falsely, but\nprimarily through the _indistinctness_ of their whole thinking, which may\nbe compared to seeing through a bad telescope, when all the outlines\nappear indistinct and as if obliterated, and the different objects run\ninto each other. The weak understanding of such minds shrinks from the\ndemand for distinctness of conceptions, and therefore they do not\nthemselves make this claim upon it, but put up with haziness; and to\nsatisfy themselves with this they gladly have recourse to _words_,\nespecially such as denote indefinite, very abstract, unusual conceptions\nwhich are hard to explain; such, for example, as infinite and finite,\nsensible and supersensible, the Idea of being, Ideas of the reason, the\nabsolute, the Idea of the good, the divine, moral freedom, power of\nspontaneous generation, the absolute Idea, subject-object, &c. The like of\nthese they confidently fling about, imagine they really express thoughts,\nand expect every one to be content with them; for the highest summit of\nwisdom which they can see is to have at command such ready-made words for\nevery possible question. This immense _satisfaction in words_ is\nthoroughly characteristic of inferior minds. It depends simply upon their\nincapacity for distinct conceptions, whenever these must rise above the\nmost trivial and simple relations. Hence upon the weakness and indolence\nof their intellect, and indeed upon the secret consciousness of this,\nwhich in the case of scholars is bound up with the early learnt and hard\nnecessity of passing themselves off as thinking beings, to meet which\ndemand in all cases they keep such a suitable store of ready-made words.\nIt must really be amusing to see a professor of philosophy of this kind in\nthe chair, who _bonâ fide_ delivers such a juggle of words destitute of\nthoughts, quite sincerely, under the delusion that they are really\nthoughts, and in front of him the students, who just as _bonâ fide_,\n_i.e._, under the same delusion, listen attentively and take notes, while\nyet in reality neither the one nor the other goes beyond the words, but\nrather these words themselves, together with the audible scratching of\npens, are the only realities in the whole matter. This peculiar\n_satisfaction in words_ has more than anything else to do with the\nperpetuation of errors. For, relying on the words and phrases received\nfrom his predecessors, each one confidently passes over obscurities and\nproblems, and thus these are propagated through centuries from book to\nbook; and the thinking man, especially in youth, is in doubt whether it\nmay be that he is incapable of understanding it, or that there is really\nnothing here to understand; and similarly, whether for others the problem\nwhich they all slink past with such comical seriousness by the same path\nis no problem at all, or whether it is only that they will not see it.\nMany truths remain undiscovered simply on this account, that no one has\nthe courage to look the problem in the face and grapple with it. On the\ncontrary, the distinctness of thought and clearness of conceptions\npeculiar to eminent minds produces the effect that even known truths when\nbrought forward by them gain new light, or at least a new stimulus. If we\nhear them or read them, it is as if we exchanged a bad telescope for a\ngood one. Let one only read, for example, in Euler’s “Letters to the\nPrincess,” his exposition of the fundamental truths of mechanics and\noptics. Upon this rests the remark of Diderot in the _Neveu de Rameau_,\nthat only the perfect masters are capable of teaching really well the\nelements of a science; just because it is only they who really understand\nthe questions, and for them words never take the place of thoughts.\n\nBut we ought to know that inferior minds are the rule, good minds the\nexception, eminent minds very rare, and genius a portent. How otherwise\ncould a human race consisting of about eight hundred million individuals\nhave left so much after six thousand years to discover, to invent, to\nthink out, and to say? The intellect is calculated for the support of the\nindividual alone, and as a rule it is only barely sufficient even for\nthis. But nature has wisely been very sparing of conferring a larger\nmeasure; for the man of limited intelligence can survey the few and simple\nrelations which lie within reach of his narrow sphere of action, and can\ncontrol the levers of them with much greater ease than could the eminently\nintellectual man who commands an incomparably larger sphere and works with\nlong levers. Thus the insect sees everything on its stem or leaf with the\nmost minute exactness, and better than we, and yet is not aware of the man\nwho stands within three steps of it. This is the reason of the slyness of\nhalf-witted persons, and the ground of the paradox: _Il y a un mystère\ndans l’esprit des gens qui n’en ont pas_. For practical life genius is\nabout as useful as an astral telescope in a theatre. Thus, with regard to\nthe intellect nature is highly _aristocratic_. The distinctions which it\nhas established are greater than those which are made in any country by\nbirth, rank, wealth, or caste. But in the aristocracy of intellect, as in\nother aristocracies, there are many thousands of plebeians for one\nnobleman, many millions for one prince, and the great multitude of men are\nmere populace, mob, rabble, _la canaille_. Now certainly there is a\nglaring contrast between the scale of rank of nature and that of\nconvention, and their agreement is only to be hoped for in a golden age.\nMeanwhile those who stand very high in the one scale of rank and in the\nother have this in common, that for the most part they live in exalted\nisolation, to which Byron refers when he says:—\n\n    “To feel me in the solitude of kings\n    Without the power that makes them bear a crown.”\n\n    —_Proph. of Dante_, c. I.\n\nFor intellect is a differentiating, and therefore a separating principle.\nIts different grades, far more than those of mere culture, give to each\nman different conceptions, in consequence of which each man lives to a\ncertain extent in a different world, in which he can directly meet those\nonly who are like himself, and can only attempt to speak to the rest and\nmake himself understood by them from a distance. Great differences in the\ngrade and in the cultivation of the understanding fix a wide gulf between\nman and man, which can only be crossed by benevolence; for it is, on the\ncontrary, the unifying principle, which identifies every one else with its\nown self. Yet the connection remains a moral one; it cannot become\nintellectual. Indeed, when the degree of culture is about the same, the\nconversation between a man of great intellect and an ordinary man is like\nthe journey together of two men, one of whom rides on a spirited horse and\nthe other goes on foot. It soon becomes very trying to both of them, and\nfor any length of time impossible. For a short way the rider can indeed\ndismount, in order to walk with the other, though even then the impatience\nof his horse will give him much to do.\n\nBut the public could be benefited by nothing so much as by the recognition\nof that _intellectual aristocracy of nature_. By virtue of such\nrecognition it would comprehend that when facts are concerned, thus when\nthe matter has to be decided from experiments, travels, codes, histories,\nand chronicles, the normal mind is certainly sufficient; but, on the other\nhand, when mere thoughts are in question, especially those thoughts the\nmaterial or data of which are within reach of every one, thus when it is\nreally only a question of _thinking before_ others, decided\nreflectiveness, native eminence, which only nature bestows, and that very\nseldom, is inevitably demanded, and no one deserves to be heard who does\nnot at once give proofs of this. If the public could be brought to see\nthis for itself, it would no longer waste the time which is sparingly\nmeasured out to it for its culture on the productions of ordinary minds,\nthus on the innumerable botches of poetry and philosophy which are\nproduced every day. It would no longer seize always what is newest, in the\nchildish delusion that books, like eggs, must be enjoyed while they are\nfresh, but would confine itself to the works of the few select and chosen\nminds of all ages and nations, would strive to learn to know and\nunderstand them, and might thus by degrees attain to true culture. And\nthen, also, those thousands of uncalled-for productions which, like tares,\nhinder the growth of the good wheat would be discontinued.\n\nChapter XVI.(26) On The Practical Use Of Reason And On Stoicism.\n\nIn the seventh chapter I have shown that, in the theoretical sphere,\nprocedure based upon _conceptions_ suffices for mediocre achievements\nonly, while great achievements, on the other hand, demand that we should\ndraw from perception itself as the primary source of all knowledge. In the\npractical sphere, however, the converse is the case. Here determination by\nwhat is perceived is the way of the brutes, but is unworthy of man, who\nhas _conceptions_ to guide his conduct, and is thus emancipated from the\npower of what is actually perceptibly present, to which the brute is\nunconditionally given over. In proportion as a man makes good this\nprerogative his conduct may be called _rational_, and only in this sense\ncan we speak of _practical reason_, not in the Kantian sense, the\ninadmissibility of which I have thoroughly exposed in my prize essay on\nthe foundation of morals.\n\nIt is not easy, however, to let oneself be determined by _conceptions_\nalone; for the directly present external world, with its perceptible\nreality, intrudes itself forcibly even on the strongest mind. But it is\njust in conquering this impression, in destroying its illusion, that the\nhuman spirit shows its worth and greatness. Thus if incitements to lust\nand pleasure leave it unaffected, if the threats and fury of enraged\nenemies do not shake it, if the entreaties of erring friends do not make\nits purpose waver, and the delusive forms with which preconcerted plots\nsurround it leave it unmoved, if the scorn of fools and of the vulgar herd\ndoes not disturb it nor trouble it as to its own worth, then it seems to\nstand under the influence of a spirit-world, visible to it alone (and this\nis the world of conceptions), before which that perceptibly present world\nwhich lies open to all dissolves like a phantom. But, on the other hand,\nwhat gives to the external world and visible reality their great power\nover the mind is their nearness and directness. As the magnetic needle,\nwhich is kept in its position by the combined action of widely distributed\nforces of nature embracing the whole earth, can yet be perturbed and set\nin violent oscillation by a small piece of iron, if only it comes quite\nclose to it, so even a great mind can sometimes be disconcerted and\nperturbed by trifling events and insignificant men, if only they affect it\nvery closely, and the deliberate purpose can be for the moment shaken by a\ntrivial but immediately present counter motive. For the influence of the\nmotives is subject to a law which is directly opposed to the law according\nto which weights act on a balance, and in consequence of it a very small\nmotive, which, however, lies very near to us, can outweigh one which in\nitself is much stronger, but which only affects us from a distance. But it\nis this quality of the mind, by reason of which it allows itself to be\ndetermined in accordance with this law, and does not withdraw itself from\nit by the strength of actual practical reason, which the ancients denoted\nby _animi impotentia_, which really signifies _ratio regendæ voluntatis\nimpotens_. Every _emotion_ (_animi perturbatio_) simply arises from the\nfact that an idea which affects our will comes so excessively near to us\nthat it conceals everything else from us, and we can no longer see\nanything but it, so that for the moment we become incapable of taking\naccount of things of another kind. It would be a valuable safeguard\nagainst this if we were to bring ourselves to regard the present, by the\nassistance of imagination, as if it were past, and should thus accustom\nour apperception to the epistolary style of the Romans. Yet conversely we\nare very well able to regard what is long past as so vividly present that\nold emotions which have long been asleep are thereby reawakened in their\nfull strength. Thus also no one would be irritated or disconcerted by a\nmisfortune, a disappointment, if reason always kept present to him what\nman really is: the most needy of creatures, daily and hourly abandoned to\ninnumerable misfortunes, great and small, το δειλοτατον ζωον, who has\ntherefore to live in constant care and fear. Herodotus already says, “Παν\nεστι ανθρωπος συμφορα” (_homo totus est calamitas_).\n\nThe application of reason to practice primarily accomplishes this. It\nreconstructs what is one-sided and defective in knowledge of mere\nperception, and makes use of the contrasts or oppositions which it\npresents, to correct each other, so that thus the objectively true result\nis arrived at. For example, if we look simply at the bad action of a man\nwe will condemn him; on the other hand, if we consider merely the need\nthat moved him to it, we will compassionate him: reason, by means of its\nconceptions, weighs the two, and leads to the conclusion that he must be\nrestrained, restricted, and curbed by a proportionate punishment.\n\nI am again reminded here of Seneca’s saying: “_Si vis tibi omnia\nsubjicere, te subjice rationi_.” Since, however, as was shown in the\nfourth book, the nature of suffering is positive, and that of pleasure\nnegative, he who takes abstract or rational knowledge as the rule of his\nconduct, and therefore constantly reflects on its consequences and on the\nfuture, will very frequently have to practise _sustine et abstine_, for in\norder to obtain the life that is most free from pain he generally\nsacrifices its keenest joys and pleasures, mindful of Aristotle’s “ὁ\nφρονιμος το αλυπον διωκει, ου το ἡδυ” (_quod dolore vacat, non quod __\nsuave est, persequitur vir prudens_). Therefore with him the future\nconstantly borrows from the present, instead of the present borrowing from\nthe future, as is the case with a frivolous fool, who thus becomes\nimpoverished and finally bankrupt. In the case of the former reason must,\nfor the most part, assume the _rôle_ of a churlish mentor, and unceasingly\ncall for renunciations, without being able to promise anything in return,\nexcept a fairly painless existence. This rests on the fact that reason, by\nmeans of its conceptions, surveys the _whole_ of life, whose outcome, in\nthe happiest conceivable case, can be no other than what we have said.\n\nWhen this striving after a painless existence, so far as it might be\nattainable by the application of and strict adherence to rational\nreflection and acquired knowledge of the true nature of life, was carried\nout with the greatest consistency and to the utmost extreme, it produced\ncynicism, from which stoicism afterwards proceeded. I wish briefly here to\nbring this out more fully for the sake of establishing more firmly the\nconcluding exposition of our first book.\n\nAll ancient moral systems, with the single exception of that of Plato,\nwere guides to a happy life. Accordingly in them the end of virtue was\nentirely in this life, not beyond death. For to them it is only the right\npath to a truly happy life; and on this account the wise choose it. Hence\narise those lengthy debates chiefly preserved for us by Cicero, those keen\nand constantly renewed investigations, whether virtue quite alone and in\nitself is really sufficient for a happy life, or whether this further\nrequires some external condition; whether the virtuous and wise may also\nbe happy on the rack and the wheel, or in the bull of Phalaris; or whether\nit does not go as far as this. For certainly this would be the touchstone\nof an ethical system of this kind; the practice of it must give happiness\ndirectly and unconditionally. If it cannot do this it does not accomplish\nwhat it ought, and must be rejected. It is therefore with truth and in\naccordance with the Christian point of view that Augustine prefaces his\nexposition of the moral systems of the ancients (_De Civ. Dei_, Lib. xix.\nc. 1) with the explanation: “_Exponenda sunt nobis argumenta mortalium,\nquibus sibi ipsi beatitudinem facere_ IN HUJUS VITÆ INFELICITATE _moliti\nsunt; ut ab eorum rebus vanis spes nostra quid differat clarescat. De\nfinibus bonorum et malorum multa inter se philosophi disputarunt; quam\nquæstionem maxima intentione versantes, invenire conati sunt, quid\nefficiat hominem beatum: illud enim est finis bonorum._” I wish to place\nbeyond all doubt the eudæmonistic end which we have ascribed to all\nancient ethics by several express statements of the ancients themselves.\nAristotle says in the “_Eth. Magna_,” i. 4: “Ἡ ευδαιμονια εν τῳ εν ζῃν\nεστι, το δε ευ ζῃν εν τῳ κατα τας αρετας ζῃν.” (_Felicitas in bene vivendo\nposita est: verum bene vivere est in eo positum, ut secundum virtutem\nvivamus_), with which may be compared “_Eth. Nicom._,” i. 5. “_Cic.\nTusc._,” v. 1: “_Nam, quum ea causa impulerit eos, qui primi se ad\nphilosophiæ studia contulerunt, ut, omnibus rebus posthabitis, totos se in\noptimo vitæ statu exquirendo collocarent; profecto spe beate vivendi\ntantam in eo studio curam operamque posuerunt_”. According to Plutarch\n(_De Repugn. Stoic._, c. xviii.) Chrysippus said: “Το κατα κακιαν ζῃν τῳ\nκακοδαιμονως ζῃν ταυτον εστι.” (_Vitiose vivere idem est guod vivere\ninfeliciter._) Ibid., c. 26: “Ἡ φρονησις ουχ ἑτερον εστι της ευδαιμονιας\nκαθ᾽ ἑαυτο, αλλ᾽ ευδαιμονια.” (_Prudentia nihil differt a felicitate,\nestque ipsa adeo felicitas._) “Stob. Ecl.,” Lib. ii. c. 7: “Τελος δε φασιν\nειναι το ευδαιμονειν, ὁυ ἑνεκα παντα πραττεται.” (_Finem esse dicunt\nfelicitatem, cujus causa fiunt omnia._) “Ευδαιμονιαν συνωνυμειν τῳ τελει\nλεγουσι.” (_Finem bonorum et felicitatem synonyma esse dicunt._) “Arrian\nDiss. Epict.,” i. 4: “Ἡ αρετη ταυτην εχει την επαγγελιαν, ευδαιμονιαν\nποιησαι.” (_Virtus profitetur, se felicitatem præstare._) Sen., Ep. 90:\n“_Ceterum (sapientia) ad beatum statum tendit, illo ducit, __ illo vias\naperit_.”—Id., Ep. 108: “_Illud admoneo auditionem philosophorum,\nlectionemque, ad propositum beatæ vitæ trahendum._”\n\nThe ethics of the Cynics also adopted this end of the happiest life, as\nthe Emperor Julian expressly testifies (Orat. vi.): “Της Κυνικης δε\nφιλοσοφιας σκοπος μεν εστι και τελος, ὡσπερ δη και πασης φιλοσοφιας, το\nευδαιμονειν; το δε ευδαιμονειν εν τῳ ζῃν κατα φυσιν, αλλα μη προς τας των\nπολλων δοξας.” (_Cynicæ philosophiæ ut etiam omnis philosophiæ, scopus et\nfinis est feliciter vivere: felicitas vitæ autem in eo posita est, ut\nsecundum naturam vivatur, nec vero secundum opiniones multitudinis._) Only\nthe Cynics followed quite a peculiar path to this end, a path directly\nopposed to the ordinary one—the path of extreme privation. They start from\nthe insight that the motions of the will which are brought about by the\nobjects which attract and excite it, and the wearisome, and for the most\npart vain, efforts to attain these, or, if they are attained, the fear of\nlosing them, and finally the loss itself, produce far greater pain than\nthe want of all these objects ever can. Therefore, in order to attain to\nthe life that is most free from pain, they chose the path of the extremest\ndestitution, and fled from all pleasures as snares through which one was\nafterwards handed over to pain. But after this they could boldly scorn\nhappiness and its caprices. This is the _spirit of cynicism_. Seneca\ndistinctly expresses it in the eighth chapter, “_De Tranquilitate Animi_:”\n“_Cogitandum est, quanto levior dolor sit, non habere, quam perdere: et\nintelligemus paupertati eo minorem tormentorum, quo minorem damnorum esse\nmateriam._” Then: “_Tolerabilius est, faciliusque, non acquirere, quam\namittere.... Diogenes effecit, ne quid sibi eripi posset, ... qui se\nfortuitis omnibus exuit.... Videtur mihi dixisse; age tuum negotium,\nfortuna: nihil apud Diogenem jam tuum est._” The parallel passage to this\nlast sentence is the quotation of Stobæus (_Ecl._ ii. 7): “Διογενης εφη\nνομιζειν ὁραν την Τυχην ενορωσαν αυτον και λεγουσαν; τουτον δ᾽ ου δυναμαι\nβαλεειν κυνα λυσσητηρα.” (_Diogenes credere se dixit, videre Fortunam,\nipsum intuentem, ac dicentem: aut hunc non potui tetigisse canem\nrabiosum._) The same spirit of cynicism is also shown in the epitaph on\nDiogenes, in Suidas, under the word Φιλισκος, and in “Diogenes Laertius,”\nvi. 2:\n\n    “Γηρασκει μεν χαλκος ὑπο χρονου; αλλα σον ουτι\n      Κυδος ὁ πας αιων, Διογενης, καθελει;\n    Μουνος επει βιοτης αυταρκεα δοξαν εδειξας\n      Θνητοις, και ζωης οιμον ελαφροτατην.”\n\n    (_Æra quidem absumit tempus, sed tempore numquam_\n      _Interitura tua est gloria, Diogenes:_\n    _Quandoquidem ad vitam miseris mortalibus æquam_\n      _Monstrata est facilis, te duce, et ampla via._)\n\nAccordingly the fundamental thought of cynicism is that life in its\nsimplest and nakedest form, with the hardships that belong to it by\nnature, is the most endurable, and is therefore to be chosen; for every\nassistance, convenience, gratification, and pleasure by means of which men\nseek to make life more agreeable only brings with it new and greater ills\nthan originally belonged to it. Therefore we may regard the following\nsentence as the expression of the kernel of the doctrine of cynicism:\n“Διογενης εβοᾳ πολλακις λεγων, τον των ανθωπων βιον ραδιον ὑπο των θεων\nδεδοσθαι, αποκεκρυφθαι δε αυτον ζητουντων μελιπηκτα και μυρα και τα\nπαραπλησια.” (_Diogenes clamabat sæpius, hominum vitam facilem a diis\ndari, verum occultari illam quærentibus mellita cibaria, unguenta et his\nsimilia._) (_Diog., Laert._, vi. 2.) And further: “Δεον, αντι των αχρηστων\nπονων, τους κατα φυσιν ἑλομενους, ζῃν ευδαιμονως; παρα την ανοιαν\nκακοδαιμονουσι.... τον αυτον χαρακτηρα του βιου λεγων διεξαγειν, ὁνπερ και\nἩρακλης, μηδεν ελευθηριας προκρινων.” (_Quum igitur, repudiatis inutilibus\nlaboribus, naturales insequi, ac vivere beate debeamus, per summam\ndementiam infelices sumus.... eandem vitæ formam, quam Hercules, se vivere\naffirmans, nihil libertati præferens. Ibid._) Therefore the old, genuine\nCynics, Antisthenes, Diogenes, Krates, and their disciples had once for\nall renounced every possession, all conveniences and pleasures, in order\nto escape for ever from the troubles and cares, the dependence and the\npains, which are inevitably bound up with them and are not counterbalanced\nby them. Through the bare satisfaction of the most pressing wants and the\nrenunciation of everything superfluous they thought they would come off\nbest. Accordingly they contented themselves with what in Athens or Corinth\nwas to be had almost for nothing, such as lupines, water, an old\nthreadbare cloak, a wallet, and a staff. They begged occasionally, as far\nas was necessary to supply such wants, but they never worked. Yet they\naccepted absolutely nothing that exceeded the wants referred to above.\nIndependence in the widest sense was their aim. They occupied their time\nin resting, going about, talking with all men, and much mocking, laughing,\nand joking; their characteristic was carelessness and great cheerfulness.\nSince now in this manner of life they had no aims of their own, no\npurposes or ends to pursue, thus were lifted above the sphere of human\naction, and at the same time always enjoyed complete leisure, they were\nadmirably fitted, as men of proved strength of mind, to be the advisers\nand admonishers of the rest. Therefore Apuleius says (_Florid._, iv.):\n“_Crates, ut lar familiaris apud homines suæ ætatis cultus est. Nulla\ndomus ei unquam clausa erat: nec erat patrisfamilias tam absconditum\nsecretum, quin eo tempestive Crates interveniret, litium omnium et\njurgiorum inter propinquos disceptator et arbiter._” Thus in this, as in\nso many other respects, they show a great likeness to the mendicant friars\nof modern times, that is, to the better and more genuine among them, whose\nideal may be seen in the Capucine Christoforo in Manzoni’s famous romance.\nYet this resemblance lies only in the effects, not in the cause. They\nagree in the result, but the fundamental thought of the two is quite\ndifferent. With the friars, as with the Sannyâsis, who are akin to them,\nit is an aim which transcends life; but with the Cynics it is only the\nconviction that it is easier to reduce their wishes and their wants to the\n_minimum_, than to attain to the _maximum_ in their satisfaction, which\nindeed is impossible, for with their satisfaction the wishes and wants\ngrow _ad infinitum_; therefore, in order to reach the goal of all ancient\nethics, the greatest happiness possible in this life, they took the path\nof renunciation as the shortest and easiest: “ὁθεν και τον Κυνισμον\nειρηκασιν συντομον επ᾽ αρετην ὁδον.” (_Unde Cynismum dixere compendiosam\nad virtutem viam._) _Diog. Laert._, vi. 9. The fundamental difference\nbetween the spirit of cynicism and that of asceticism comes out very\nclearly in the humility which is essential to the ascetic, but is so\nforeign to the Cynic that, on the contrary, he is distinguished beyond\neverything else for pride and scorn:—\n\n    “_Sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,_\n    _Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex denique regum._”—_Hor._\n\nOn the other hand, the view of life held by the Cynics agrees in spirit\nwith that of J. J. Rousseau as he expounds it in the “_Discours sur\nl’Origine de l’Inégalité_.” For he also would wish to lead us back to the\ncrude state of nature, and regards the reduction of our wants to the\nminimum as the surest path to happiness. For the rest, the Cynics were\nexclusively _practical_ philosophers: at least no account of their\ntheoretical philosophy is known to me.\n\nNow the Stoics proceeded from them in this way—they changed the practical\ninto the theoretical. They held that the _actual_ dispensing with\neverything that can be done without is not demanded, but that it is\nsufficient that we should regard possessions and pleasures constantly as\n_dispensable_, and as held in the hand of chance; for then the actual\ndeprivation of them, if it should chance to occur, would neither be\nunexpected nor fall heavily. One might always have and enjoy everything;\nonly one must ever keep present the conviction of the worthlessness and\ndispensableness of these good things on the one hand, and of their\nuncertainty and perishableness on the other, and therefore prize them all\nvery little, and be always ready to give them up. Nay more, he who must\nactually dispense with these things in order not to be moved by them,\nthereby shows that in his heart he holds them to be truly good things,\nwhich one must put quite out of sight if one is not to long after them.\nThe wise man, on the other hand, knows that they are not good things at\nall, but rather perfectly indifferent things, αδιαφορα, in any case\nπροηγμενα. Therefore if they present themselves he will accept them, but\nyet is always ready to let them go again, if chance, to which they belong,\nshould demand them back; for they are των ουκ εφ᾽ ἡμιν. In this sense,\nEpictetus, chap. vii., says that the wise man, like one who has landed\nfrom a ship, &c., will also let himself be comforted by a wife or a child,\nbut yet will always be ready, whenever the captain calls, to let them go\nagain. Thus the Stoics perfected the theory of equanimity and independence\nat the cost of the practice, for they reduced everything to a mental\nprocess, and by arguments, such as are presented in the first chapter of\nEpictetus, sophisticated themselves into all the amenities of life. But in\ndoing so they left out of account that everything to which one is\naccustomed becomes a need, and therefore can only be given up with pain;\nthat the will does not allow itself to be played with, cannot enjoy\nwithout loving the pleasures; that a dog does not remain indifferent if\none draws a piece of meat through its mouth, and neither does a wise man\nif he is hungry; and that there is no middle path between desiring and\nrenouncing. But they believed that they satisfied their principles if,\nsitting at a luxurious Roman table, they left no dish untasted, yet at the\nsame time protested that they were each and all of them mere προηγμενα,\nnot αγαθα; or in plain English, if they eat, drank, and were merry, yet\ngave no thanks to God for it all, but rather made fastidious faces, and\npersisted in boldly asserting that they gained nothing whatever from the\nwhole feast. This was the expedient of the Stoics; they were therefore\nmere braggarts, and stand to the Cynics in much the same relation as\nwell-fed Benedictines and Augustines stand to Franciscans and Capucines.\nNow the more they neglected practice, the more they refined the theory. I\nshall here add a few proofs and supplementary details to the exposition of\nit given at the close of our first book.\n\nIf we search in the writings of the Stoics which remain to us, all of\nwhich are unsystematically composed, for the ultimate ground of that\nirrefragible equanimity which is unceasingly demanded of us, we find no\nother than the knowledge that the course of the world is entirely\nindependent of our will, and consequently, that the evil which befalls us\nis inevitable. If we have regulated our claims by a correct insight into\nthis, then mourning, rejoicing, fearing, and hoping are follies of which\nwe are no longer capable. Further, especially in the commentaries of\nArrian, it is surreptitiously assumed that all that is ουκ εφ᾽ ἡμιν\n(_i.e._, does not depend upon us) is at once also ου προς ἡμας (_i.e._,\ndoes not concern us). Yet it remains true that all the good things of life\nare in the power of chance, and therefore whenever it makes use of this\npower to deprive us of them, we are unhappy if we have placed our\nhappiness in them. From this unworthy fate we are, in the opinion of the\nStoics, delivered by the right use of reason, by virtue of which we regard\nall these things, never as ours, but only as lent to us for an indefinite\ntime; only thus can we never really lose them. Therefore Seneca says (Ep.\n98): “_Si, quid humanarum rerum varietas possit, cogitaverit, ante quam\nsenserit_,” and Diogenes Laertius (vii. 1. 87): “Ισον δε εστι το κατ᾽\nαρετην ζῃν τῳ κατ᾽ εμπειριαν των φυσει συμβαινοντων ζῃν.” (_Secundum\nvirtutem vivere idem est, quod secundum experientiam eorum, quæ secundum\nnaturam accidunt, vivere._) The passage in Arrian’s “Discourses of\nEpictetus,” B. iii., c. 24, 84-89, is particularly in point here; and\nespecially, as a proof of what I have said in this reference in § 16 of\nthe first volume, the passage: “Τουτο γαρ εστι το αιτιον τοις ανθροποις\nπαντων των κακων το τας προληψεις τας κοινας μη δυνασθαι εφαρμοζειν τοις\nεπι μερους,” Ibid. iv., 1. 42. (_Hæc enim causa est hominibus omnium\nmalorum, quod anticipationes generales rebus singularibus accommodare non\npossunt._) Similarly the passage in “Marcus Aurelius” (iv. 29): “Ει ξενος\nκοσμου ὁ μη γνωριζων τα εν αυτῳ οντα, ουχ ἡττον ξενος και ο μη γνωριζων τα\nγιγνομενα;” that is: “If he is a stranger to the universe who does not\nknow what is in it, no less is he a stranger who does not know how things\ngo on in it.” Also Seneca’s eleventh chapter, “_De Tranquilitate Animi_,”\nis a complete proof of this view. The opinion of the Stoics amounts on the\nwhole to this, that if a man has watched for a while the juggling illusion\nof happiness and then uses his reason, he must recognise both the rapid\nchanges of the dice and the intrinsic worthlessness of the counters, and\ntherefore must henceforth remain unmoved. Taken generally the Stoical\npoint of view may be thus expressed: our suffering always arises from the\nwant of agreement between our wishes and the course of the world.\nTherefore one of these two must be changed and adapted to the other. Since\nnow the course of things is not in our power (ουκ εφ᾽ ἡμιν), we must\ndirect our volitions and desires according to the course of things: for\nthe will alone is εφ᾽ ἡμιν. This adaptation of volition to the course of\nthe external world, thus to the nature of things, is very often understood\nunder the ambiguous κατα φυσιν ζην. See the “Discourses of Epictetus,” ii.\n17, 21, 22. Seneca also denotes this point of view (Ep. 119) when he says:\n“_Nihil interest, utrum non desideres, an habeas. Summa rei in utroque est\neadem: non torqueberis._” Also Cicero (_Tusc._ iv. 26) by the words:\n“_Solum habere velle, summa dementia est._” Similarly Arrian (iv. 1. 175):\n“Ου γαρ εκπληρωσει των επιθυμουμενων ελευθερια παρασκευαζεται, αλλα\nανασκευη της επιθυμιας.” (_Non enim explendis desideriis libertas\ncomparatur, sed tollenda cupiditate._)\n\nThe collected quotations in the “_Historia Philosophiæ Græco-Romanæ_” of\nRitter and Preller may be taken as proofs of what I have said, in the\nplace referred to above, about the ὁμολογουμενως ζῃν of the Stoics. Also\nthe saying of Seneca (Ep. 31, and again Ep. 74): “_Perfecta virtus est\næqualitas et tenor vitæ per omnia consonans sibi._” The following passage\nof Seneca’s indicates the spirit of the Stoa generally (Ep. 92): “_Quid\nest beata vita? Securitas et perpetua tranquillitas. Hanc dabit animi\nmagnitudo, dabit constantia bene judicati tenax._” A systematical study of\nthe Stoics will convince every one that the end of their ethics, like that\nof the ethics of Cynicism from which they sprang, is really nothing else\nthan a life as free as possible from pain, and therefore as happy as\npossible. Whence it follows that the Stoical morality is only a special\nform of _Eudæmonism_. It has not, like the Indian, the Christian, and even\nthe Platonic ethics, a metaphysical tendency, a transcendental end, but a\ncompletely immanent end, attainable in this life; the steadfast serenity\n(αταραξια) and unclouded happiness of the wise man, whom nothing can\ndisturb. Yet it cannot be denied that the later Stoics, especially Arrian,\nsometimes lose sight of this end, and show a really ascetic tendency,\nwhich is to be attributed to the Christian and Oriental spirit in general\nwhich was then already spreading. If we consider closely and seriously the\ngoal of Stoicism, that αταραξια, we find in it merely a hardening and\ninsensibility to the blow of fate which a man attains to because he keeps\never present to his mind the shortness of life, the emptiness of pleasure,\nthe instability of happiness, and has also discerned that the difference\nbetween happiness and unhappiness is very much less than our anticipation\nof both is wont to represent. But this is yet no state of happiness; it is\nonly the patient endurance of sufferings which one has foreseen as\nirremediable. Yet magnanimity and worth consist in this, that one should\nbear silently and patiently what is irremediable, in melancholy peace,\nremaining always the same, while others pass from rejoicing to despair and\nfrom despair to rejoicing. Accordingly one may also conceive of Stoicism\nas a spiritual hygiene, in accordance with which, just as one hardens the\nbody against the influences of wind and weather, against fatigue and\nexertion, one has also to harden one’s mind against misfortune, danger,\nloss, injustice, malice, perfidy, arrogance, and the folly of men.\n\nI remark further, that the καθγκοντα of the Stoics, which Cicero\ntranslates _officia_, signify as nearly as possible _Obliegenheiten_, or\nthat which it befits the occasion to do; English, _incumbencies_; Italian,\n_quel che tocca a me di fare, o di lasciare_, thus what _it behoves_ a\nreasonable man to do. Cf. _Diog. Laert._, vii. 1. 109. Finally, the\n_pantheism_ of the Stoics, though absolutely inconsistent with many an\nexhortation of Arrian, is most distinctly expressed by Seneca: “_Quid est\nDeus? Mens universi. Quid est Deus? Quod vides totum, et quod non vides\ntotum. Sic demum magnitudo sua illi redditur, qua nihil majus excogitari\npotest: si solus est omnia, opus suum et extra, et intra tenet._” (_Quæst.\nNatur._ 1, _præfatio_ 12.)\n\nChapter XVII.(27) On Man’s Need Of Metaphysics.\n\nWith the exception of man, no being wonders at its own existence; but it\nis to them all so much a matter of course that they do not observe it. The\nwisdom of nature speaks out of the peaceful glance of the brutes; for in\nthem the will and the intellect are not yet so widely separated that they\ncan be astonished at each other when they meet again. Thus here the whole\nphenomenon is still firmly attached to the stem of nature from which it\nhas come, and is partaker of the unconscious omniscience of the great\nmother. Only after the inner being of nature (the will to live in its\nobjectification) has ascended, vigorous and cheerful, through the two\nseries of unconscious existences, and then through the long and broad\nseries of animals, does it attain at last to reflection for the first time\non the entrance of reason, thus in man. Then it marvels at its own works,\nand asks itself what it itself is. Its wonder however is the more serious,\nas it here stands for the first time consciously in the presence of\n_death_, and besides the finiteness of all existence, the vanity of all\neffort forces itself more or less upon it. With this reflection and this\nwonder there arises therefore for man alone, the _need for a metaphysic_;\nhe is accordingly an _animal metaphysicum_. At the beginning of his\nconsciousness certainly he also accepts himself as a matter of course.\nThis does not last long however, but very early, with the first dawn of\nreflection, that wonder already appears, which is some day to become the\nmother of metaphysics. In agreement with this Aristotle also says at the\nbeginning of his metaphysics: “Δια γαρ το θαυμαζειν οἱ ανθρωποι και νυν\nκαι το πρωτον ηρξαντο φιλοσοφειν.” (_Propter admirationem enim et nunc et\nprimo inceperunt homines philosophari._) Moreover, the special\nphilosophical disposition consists primarily in this, that a man is\ncapable of wonder beyond the ordinary and everyday degree, and is thus\ninduced to make the _universal_ of the phenomenon his problem, while the\ninvestigators in the natural sciences wonder only at exquisite or rare\nphenomena, and their problem is merely to refer these to phenomena which\nare better known. The lower a man stands in an intellectual regard the\nless of a problem is existence itself for him; everything, how it is, and\nthat it is, appears to him rather a matter of course. This rests upon the\nfact that his intellect still remains perfectly true to its original\ndestiny of being serviceable to the will as the medium of motives, and\ntherefore is closely bound up with the world and nature, as an integral\npart of them. Consequently it is very far from comprehending the world in\na purely objective manner, freeing itself, so to speak, from the whole of\nthings, opposing itself to this whole, and so for a while becoming as if\nself-existent. On the other hand, the philosophical wonder which springs\nfrom this is conditioned in the individual by higher development of the\nintellect, yet in general not by this alone; but without doubt it is the\nknowledge of death, and along with this the consideration of the suffering\nand misery of life, which gives the strongest impulse to philosophical\nreflection and metaphysical explanation of the world. If our life were\nendless and painless, it would perhaps occur to no one to ask why the\nworld exists, and is just the kind of world it is; but everything would\njust be taken as a matter of course. In accordance with this we find that\nthe interest which philosophical and also religious systems inspire has\nalways its strongest hold in the dogma of some kind of existence after\ndeath; and although the most recent systems seem to make the existence of\ntheir gods the main point, and to defend this most zealously, yet in\nreality this is only because they have connected their special dogma of\nimmortality with this, and regard the one as inseparable from the other:\nonly on this account is it of importance to them. For if one could\nestablish their doctrine of immortality for them in some other way, their\nlively zeal for their gods would at once cool, and it would give place\nalmost to complete indifference if, conversely, the absolute impossibility\nof immortality were proved to them; for the interest in the existence of\nthe gods would vanish with the hope of a closer acquaintance with them, to\nthe residuum which might connect itself with their possible influence on\nthe events of this present life. But if one could prove that continued\nexistence after death is incompatible with the existence of gods, because,\nlet us say, it pre-supposes originality of being, they would soon\nsacrifice the gods to their own immortality and become zealous for\nAtheism. The fact that the materialistic systems, properly so-called, and\nalso absolute scepticism, have never been able to obtain a general or\nlasting influence, depends upon the same grounds.\n\nTemples and churches, pagodas and mosques, in all lands and in all ages,\nin splendour and vastness, testify to the metaphysical need of man, which,\nstrong and ineradicable, follows close upon his physical need. Certainly\nwhoever is satirically inclined might add that this metaphysical need is a\nmodest fellow who is content with poor fare. It sometimes allows itself to\nbe satisfied with clumsy fables and insipid tales. If only imprinted early\nenough, they are for a man adequate explanations of his existence and\nsupports of his morality. Consider, for example, the Koran. This wretched\nbook was sufficient to found a religion of the world, to satisfy the\nmetaphysical need of innumerable millions of men for twelve hundred years,\nto become the foundation of their morality, and of no small contempt for\ndeath, and also to inspire them to bloody wars and most extended\nconquests. We find in it the saddest and the poorest form of Theism. Much\nmay be lost through the translations; but I have not been able to discover\none single valuable thought in it. Such things show that metaphysical\ncapacity does not go hand in hand with the metaphysical need. Yet it will\nappear that in the early ages of the present surface of the earth this was\nnot the case, and that those who stood considerably nearer than we do to\nthe beginning of the human race and the source of organic nature, had also\nboth greater energy of the intuitive faculty of knowledge, and a truer\ndisposition of mind, so that they were capable of a purer, more direct\ncomprehension of the inner being of nature, and were thus in a position to\nsatisfy the metaphysical need in a more worthy manner. Thus originated in\nthe primitive ancestors of the Brahmans, the Rishis, the almost\nsuper-human conceptions which were afterwards set down in the Upanishads\nof the Vedas.\n\nOn the other hand, there have never been wanting persons who were\ninterested in deriving their living from that metaphysical need, and in\nmaking the utmost they could out of it. Therefore among all nations there\nare monopolists and farmers-general of it—the priests. Yet their trade had\neverywhere to be assured to them in this way, that they received the right\nto impart their metaphysical dogmas to men at a very early age, before the\njudgment has awakened from its morning slumber, thus in early childhood;\nfor then every well-impressed dogma, however senseless it may be, remains\nfor ever. If they had to wait till the judgment is ripe, their privileges\ncould not continue.\n\nA second, though not a numerous class of persons, who derive their support\nfrom the metaphysical need of man, is constituted by those who live by\n_philosophy_. By the Greeks they were called Sophists, by the moderns they\nare called Professors of Philosophy. Aristotle (_Metaph._, ii. 2) without\nhesitation numbers Aristippus among the Sophists. In Diogenes Laertius\n(ii. 65) we find that the reason of this is that he was the first of the\nSocratics who accepted payment for his philosophy; on account of which\nSocrates also returned him his present. Among the moderns also those who\nlive _by_ philosophy are not only, as a rule, and with the rarest\nexceptions, quite different from those who live _for_ philosophy, but they\nare very often the opponents, the secret and irreconcilable enemies of the\nlatter. For every true and important philosophical achievement will\novershadow their own too much, and, moreover, cannot adapt itself to the\nviews and limitations of their guild. Therefore it is always their\nendeavour to prevent such a work from making its way; and for this\npurpose, according to the age and circumstances in each case, the\ncustomary means are suppressing, concealing, hushing up, ignoring and\nkeeping secret, or denying, disparaging, censuring, slandering and\ndistorting, or, finally, denouncing and persecuting. Hence many a great\nman has had to drag himself wearily through life unknown, unhonoured,\nunrewarded, till at last, after his death, the world became undeceived as\nto him and as to them. In the meanwhile they had attained their end, had\nbeen accepted by preventing him from being accepted, and, with wife and\nchild, had lived _by_ philosophy, while he lived _for_ it. But if he is\ndead, then the thing is reversed; the new generation of the former class,\nwhich always exists, now becomes heir to his achievements, cuts them down\nto its own measure, and now lives _by_ him. That Kant could yet live both\n_by_ and _for_ philosophy depended on the rare circumstance that, for the\nfirst time since _Divus Antoninus_ and _Divus Julianus_, a philosopher sat\non the throne. Only under such auspices could the “Critique of Pure\nReason” have seen the light. Scarcely was the king dead than we see that\nKant also, seized with fear, because he belonged to the guild, modified,\nexpurgated, and spoiled his masterpiece in the second edition, and yet was\nsoon in danger of losing his place; so that Campe invited him to come to\nhim, in Brunswick, and live with him as the instructor of his family\n(Ring., _Ansichten aus Kant’s Leben_, p. 68). University philosophy is, as\na rule, mere juggling. Its real aim is to impart to the students, in the\ndeepest ground of their thought, that tendency of mind which the ministry\nthat appoints to the professorships regards as consistent with its views.\nThe ministry may also be perfectly right in this from a statesman’s point\nof view; only the result of it is that such philosophy of the chair is a\n_nervis alienis mobile lignum_, and cannot be regarded as serious\nphilosophy, but as the mere jest of it. Moreover, it is at any rate just\nthat such inspection or guidance should extend only to the philosophy of\nthe chair, and not to the real philosophy that is in earnest. For if\nanything in the world is worth wishing for—so well worth wishing for that\neven the ignorant and dull herd in its more reflective moments would prize\nit more than silver and gold—it is that a ray of light should fall on the\nobscurity of our being, and that we should gain some explanation of our\nmysterious existence, in which nothing is clear but its misery and its\nvanity. But even if this is in itself attainable, it is made impossible by\nimposed and compulsory solutions.\n\nWe shall now subject to a general consideration the different ways of\nsatisfying this strong metaphysical need.\n\nBy _metaphysics_ I understand all knowledge that pretends to transcend the\npossibility of experience, thus to transcend nature or the given\nphenomenal appearance of things, in order to give an explanation of that\nby which, in some sense or other, this experience or nature is\nconditioned; or, to speak in popular language, of that which is behind\nnature, and makes it possible. But the great original diversity in the\npower of understanding, besides the cultivation of it, which demands much\nleisure, makes so great a difference between men, that as soon as a people\nhas emerged from the state of savages, no _one_ metaphysic can serve for\nthem all. Therefore among civilised nations we find throughout two\ndifferent kinds of metaphysics, which are distinguished by the fact that\nthe one has its evidence _in itself_, the other _outside itself_. Since\nthe metaphysical systems of the first kind require reflection, culture,\nand leisure for the recognition of their evidence, they can be accessible\nonly to a very small number of men; and, moreover, they can only arise and\nmaintain their existence in the case of advanced civilisation. On the\nother hand, the systems of the second kind exclusively are for the great\nmajority of men who are not capable of thinking, but only of believing,\nand who are not accessible to reasons, but only to authority. These\nsystems may therefore be called metaphysics of the people, after the\nanalogy of poetry of the people, and also wisdom of the people, by which\nis understood proverbs. These systems, however, are known under the name\nof religions, and are found among all nations, not excepting even the most\nsavage. Their evidence is, as has been said, external, and as such is\ncalled revelation, which is authenticated by signs and miracles. Their\narguments are principally threats of eternal, and indeed also temporal\nevils, directed against unbelievers, and even against mere doubters. As\n_ultima ratio theologorum_, we find among many nations the stake or things\nsimilar to it. If they seek a different authentication, or if they make\nuse of other arguments, they already make the transition into the systems\nof the first kind, and may degenerate into a mixture of the two, which\nbrings more danger than advantage, for their invaluable prerogative of\nbeing imparted to _children_ gives them the surest guarantee of the\npermanent possession of the mind, for thereby their dogmas grow into a\nkind of second inborn intellect, like the twig upon the grafted tree;\nwhile, on the other hand, the systems of the first kind only appeal to\ngrown-up people, and in them always find a system of the second kind\nalready in possession of their convictions. Both kinds of metaphysics,\nwhose difference may be briefly expressed by the words reasoned conviction\nand faith, have this in common, that every one of their particular systems\nstands in a hostile relation to all the others of its kind. Between those\nof the first kind war is waged only with word and pen; between those of\nthe second with fire and sword as well. Several of the latter owe their\npropagation in part to this last kind of polemic, and all have by degrees\ndivided the earth between them, and indeed with such decided authority\nthat the peoples of the earth are distinguished and separated more\naccording to them than according to nationality or government. They alone\n_reign_, each in its own province. The systems of the first kind, on the\ncontrary, are at the most _tolerated_, and even this only because, on\naccount of the small number of their adherents, they are for the most part\nnot considered worth the trouble of combating with fire and\nsword—although, where it seemed necessary, these also have been employed\nagainst them with effect; besides, they occur only in a sporadic form. Yet\nin general they have only been endured in a tamed and subjugated\ncondition, for the system of the second kind which prevailed in the\ncountry ordered them to conform their teaching more or less closely to its\nown. Sometimes it not only subjugated them, but even employed their\nservices and used them as a support, which is however a dangerous\nexperiment. For these systems of the first kind, since they are deprived\nof power, believe they may advance themselves by craft, and never entirely\nlay aside a secret ill-will which at times comes unexpectedly into\nprominence and inflicts injuries which are hard to heal. For they are\nfurther made the more dangerous by the fact that all the real sciences,\nnot even excepting the most innocent, are their secret allies against the\nsystems of the second kind, and without themselves being openly at war\nwith the latter, suddenly and unexpectedly do great mischief in their\nprovince. Besides, the attempt which is aimed at by the enlistment\nreferred to of the services of the systems of the first kind by the\nsecond—the attempt to add an inner authentication to a system whose\noriginal authentication was external, is in its nature perilous; for, if\nit were capable of such an authentication, it would never have required an\nexternal one. And in general it is always a hazardous thing to attempt to\nplace a new foundation under a finished structure. Moreover, how should a\nreligion require the suffrage of a philosophy? It has everything upon its\nside—revelation, tradition, miracles, prophecies, the protection of the\ngovernment, the highest rank, as is due to the truth, the consent and\nreverence of all, a thousand temples in which it is proclaimed and\npractised, bands of sworn priests, and, what is more than all, the\ninvaluable privilege of being allowed to imprint its doctrines on the mind\nat the tender age of childhood, whereby they became almost like innate\nideas. With such wealth of means at its disposal, still to desire the\nassent of poor philosophers it must be more covetous, or to care about\ntheir contradiction it must be more fearful, than seems to be compatible\nwith a good conscience.\n\nTo the distinction established above between metaphysics of the first and\nof the second kind, we have yet to add the following:—A system of the\nfirst kind, thus a philosophy, makes the claim, and has therefore the\nobligation, in everything that it says, _sensu stricto et proprio_, to be\ntrue, for it appeals to thought and conviction. A religion, on the other\nhand, being intended for the innumerable multitude who, since they are\nincapable of examination and thought, would never comprehend the\nprofoundest and most difficult truths _sensu proprio_, has only the\nobligation to be true _sensu allegorico_. Truth cannot appear naked before\nthe people. A symptom of this _allegorical_ nature of religions is the\n_mysteries_ which are to be found perhaps in them all, certain dogmas\nwhich cannot even be distinctly thought, not to speak of being literally\ntrue. Indeed, perhaps it might be asserted that some absolute\ncontradictions, some actual absurdities, are an essential ingredient in a\ncomplete religion, for these are just the stamp of its allegorical nature,\nand the only adequate means of making the ordinary mind and the uncultured\nunderstanding _feel_ what would be incomprehensible to it, that religion\nhas ultimately to do with quite a different order of things, with an order\nof _things in themselves_, in the presence of which the laws of this\nphenomenal world, in conformity with which it must speak, vanish; and that\ntherefore not only the contradictory but also the comprehensible dogmas\nare really only allegories and accommodations to the human power of\ncomprehension. It seems to me that it was in this spirit that Augustine\nand even Luther adhered to the mysteries of Christianity in opposition to\nPelagianism, which sought to reduce everything to the dull level of\ncomprehensibility. From this point of view it is also conceivable how\nTertullian could say in all seriousness: “_Prorsus credibile est, quia\nineptum est: ... certum est, quia impossibile_” (_De Carne Christi_, c.\n5). This _allegorical_ nature of religions makes them independent of the\nproofs which are incumbent on philosophy, and in general withdraws them\nfrom investigation. Instead of this they require faith, that is, a\nvoluntary admission that such is the state of the case. Since, then, faith\nguides action, and the allegory is always so framed that, as regards the\npractical, it leads precisely to that which the truth _sensu proprio_\nwould also lead to, religion is justified in promising to those who\nbelieve eternal salvation. Thus we see that in the main, and for the great\nmajority, who cannot apply themselves to thought, religions very well\nsupply the place of metaphysics in general, the need of which man feels to\nbe imperative. They do this partly in a practical interest, as the guiding\nstar of their action, the unfurled standard of integrity and virtue, as\nKant admirably expresses it; partly as the indispensable comfort in the\nheavy sorrows of life, in which capacity they fully supply the place of an\nobjectively true metaphysic, because they lift man above himself and his\nexistence in time, as well perhaps as such a metaphysic ever could. In\nthis their great value and indeed necessity shows itself very clearly. For\nPlato says, and says rightly, “φιλόσοφον πλῆθος ἁδύνατον εἶναι” (_vulgus\nphilosophum esse impossible est_. _De Rep._, vi. p. 89, _Bip_.) On the\nother hand, the only stumbling-stone is this, that religions never dare to\nconfess their allegorical nature, but have to assert that they are true\n_sensu proprio_. They thereby encroach on the province of metaphysics\nproper, and call forth the antagonism of the latter, which has therefore\nexpressed itself at all times when it was not chained up. The controversy\nwhich is so perseveringly carried on in our own day between\nsupernaturalists and rationalists also rests on the failure to recognise\nthe allegorical nature of all religion. Both wish to have Christianity\ntrue _sensu proprio_; in this sense the former wish to maintain it without\ndeduction, as it were with skin and hair; and thus they have a hard stand\nto make against the knowledge and general culture of the age. The latter\nwish to explain away all that is properly Christian; whereupon they retain\nsomething which is neither _sensu proprio_ nor _sensu allegorico_ true,\nbut rather a mere platitude, little better than Judaism, or at the most a\nshallow Pelagianism, and, what is worst, an abject optimism, absolutely\nforeign to Christianity proper. Moreover, the attempt to found a religion\nupon reason removes it into the other class of metaphysics, that which has\nits authentication _in itself_, thus to the foreign ground of the\nphilosophical systems, and into the conflict which these wage against each\nother in their own arena, and consequently exposes it to the light fire of\nscepticism and the heavy artillery of the “Critique of Pure Reason;” but\nfor it to venture there would be clear presumption.\n\nIt would be most beneficial to both kinds of metaphysics that each of them\nshould remain clearly separated from the other and confine itself to its\nown province, that it may there be able to develop its nature fully.\nInstead of which, through the whole Christian era, the endeavour has been\nto bring about a fusion of the two, for the dogmas and conceptions of the\none have been carried over into the other, whereby both are spoiled. This\nhas taken place in the most open manner in our own day in that strange\nhermaphrodite or centaur, the so-called philosophy of religion, which, as\na kind of gnosis, endeavours to interpret the given religion, and to\nexplain what is true _sensu allegorico_ through something which is true\n_sensu proprio_. But for this we would have to know and possess the truth\n_sensu proprio_ already; and in that case such an interpretation would be\nsuperfluous. For to seek first to find metaphysics, _i.e._, the truth\n_sensu proprio_, merely out of religion by explanation and interpretation\nwould be a doubtful and dangerous undertaking, to which one would only\nmake up one’s mind if it were proved that truth, like iron and other base\nmetals, could only be found in a mixed, not in a pure form, and therefore\none could only obtain it by reduction from the mixed ore.\n\nReligions are necessary for the people, and an inestimable benefit to\nthem. But if they oppose themselves to the progress of mankind in the\nknowledge of the truth, they must with the utmost possible forbearance be\nset aside. And to require that a great mind—a Shakspeare; a Goethe—should\nmake the dogmas of any religion implicitly, _bonâ fide et sensu proprio_,\nhis conviction is to require that a giant should put on the shoe of a\ndwarf.\n\nReligions, being calculated with reference to the power of comprehension\nof the great mass of men, can only have indirect, not immediate truth. To\nrequire of them the latter is as if one wished to read the letters set up\nin the form-chase, instead of their impression. The value of a religion\nwill accordingly depend upon the greater or less content of truth which it\ncontains under the veil of allegory, and then upon the greater or less\ndistinctness with which it becomes visible through this veil, thus upon\nthe transparency of the latter. It almost seems that, as the oldest\nlanguages are the most perfect, so also are the oldest religions. If I\nwere to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I\nwould be obliged to concede to Buddhism the pre-eminence over the rest. In\nany case it must be a satisfaction to me to see my teaching in such close\nagreement with a religion which the majority of men upon the earth hold as\ntheir own; for it numbers far more adherents than any other. This\nagreement, however, must be the more satisfactory to me because in my\nphilosophising I have certainly not been under its influence. For up till\n1818, when my work appeared, there were very few, exceedingly incomplete\nand scanty, accounts of Buddhism to be found in Europe, which were almost\nentirely limited to a few essays in the earlier volumes of “Asiatic\nResearches,” and were principally concerned with the Buddhism of the\nBurmese. Only since then has fuller information about this religion\ngradually reached us, chiefly through the profound and instructive essays\nof the meritorious member of the St. Petersburg Academy, J. J. Schmidt, in\nthe proceedings of his Academy, and then little by little through several\nEnglish and French scholars, so that I was able to give a fairly numerous\nlist of the best works on this religion in my work, “_Ueber den Willen in\nder Natur_,” under the heading _Sinologie_. Unfortunately Csoma Körösi,\nthat persevering Hungarian, who, in order to study the language and sacred\nwritings of Buddhism, spent many years in Tibet, and for the most part in\nBuddhist monasteries, was carried off by death just as he was beginning to\nwork out for us the results of his researches. I cannot, however, deny the\npleasure with which I read, in his provisional accounts, several passages\ncited directly from the Kahgyur itself; for example, the following\nconversation of the dying Buddha with Brahma, who is doing him homage:\n“There is a description of their conversation on the subject of\ncreation,—by whom was the world made? Shakya asks several questions of\nBrahma,—whether was it he who made or produced such and such things, and\nendowed or blessed them with such and such virtues or properties,—whether\nwas it he who caused the several revolutions in the destruction and\nregeneration of the world. He denies that he had ever done anything to\nthat effect. At last he himself asks Shakya how the world was made,—by\nwhom? Here are attributed all changes in the world to the moral works of\nthe animal beings, and it is stated that in the world all is illusion,\nthere is no reality in the things; all is empty. Brahma, being instructed\nin his doctrine, becomes his follower” (Asiatic Researches, vol. XX. p.\n434).\n\nI cannot place, as is always done, the fundamental difference of all\nreligions in the question whether they are monotheistic, polytheistic,\npantheistic, or atheistic, but only in the question whether they are\noptimistic or pessimistic, that is, whether they present the existence of\nthe world as justified by itself, and therefore praise and value it, or\nregard it as something that can only be conceived as the consequence of\nour guilt, and therefore properly ought not to be, because they recognise\nthat pain and death cannot lie in the eternal, original, and immutable\norder of things, in that which in every respect ought to be. The power by\nvirtue of which Christianity was able to overcome first Judaism, and then\nthe heathenism of Greece and Rome, lies solely in its pessimism, in the\nconfession that our state is both exceedingly wretched and sinful, while\nJudaism and heathenism were optimistic. That truth, profoundly and\npainfully felt by all, penetrated, and bore in its train the need of\nredemption.\n\nI turn to a general consideration of the other kind of metaphysics, that\nwhich has its authentication in itself, and is called _philosophy_. I\nremind the reader of its origin, mentioned above, in a _wonder_ concerning\nthe world and our own existence, inasmuch as these press upon the\nintellect as a riddle, the solution of which therefore occupies mankind\nwithout intermission. Here, then, I wish first of all to draw attention to\nthe fact that this could not be the case if, in Spinoza’s sense, which in\nour own day has so often been brought forward again under modern forms and\nexpositions as pantheism, the world were an “_absolute substance_,” and\ntherefore an _absolutely necessary existence_. For this means that it\nexists with so great a necessity that beside it every other necessity\ncomprehensible to our understanding as such must appear as an accident. It\nwould then be something which comprehended in itself not only all actual\nbut also all possible existence, so that, as Spinoza indeed declares, its\npossibility and its actuality would be absolutely one. Its non-being would\ntherefore be impossibility itself; thus it would be something the\nnon-being or other-being of which must be completely inconceivable, and\nwhich could therefore just as little be thought away as, for example,\nspace or time. And since, further, _we ourselves_ would be parts, modes,\nattributes, or accidents of such an absolute substance, which would be the\nonly thing that, in any sense, could ever or anywhere exist, our and its\nexistence, together with its properties, would necessarily be very far\nfrom presenting itself to us as remarkable, problematical, and indeed as\nan unfathomable and ever-disquieting riddle, but, on the contrary, would\nbe far more self-evident than that two and two make four. For we would\nnecessarily be incapable of thinking anything else than that the world is,\nand is, as it is; and therefore we would necessarily be as little\nconscious of its existence _as such_, _i.e._, as a problem for reflection,\nas we are of the incredibly fast motion of our planet.\n\nAll this, however, is absolutely not the case. Only to the brutes, who are\nwithout thought, does the world and existence appear as a matter of\ncourse; to man, on the contrary, it is a problem, of which even the most\nuneducated and narrow-minded becomes vividly conscious in certain brighter\nmoments, but which enters more distinctly and more permanently into the\nconsciousness of each one of us the clearer and more enlightened that\nconsciousness is, and the more material for thought it has acquired\nthrough culture, which all ultimately rises, in minds that are naturally\nadapted for philosophising, to Plato’s “θαυμαζειν, μαλα φιλοσοφικον παθος”\n(_mirari, valde philosophicus affectus_), that is, to that _wonder_ which\ncomprehends in its whole magnitude that problem which unceasingly occupies\nthe nobler portion of mankind in every age and in every land, and gives it\nno rest. In fact, the pendulum which keeps in motion the clock of\nmetaphysics, that never runs down, is the consciousness that the\nnon-existence of this world is just as possible as its existence. Thus,\nthen, the Spinozistic view of it as an absolutely necessary existence,\nthat is, as something that absolutely and in every sense ought to and must\nbe, is a false one. Even simple Theism, since in its cosmological proof it\ntacitly starts by inferring the previous non-existence of the world from\nits existence, thereby assumes beforehand that the world is something\ncontingent. Nay, what is more, we very soon apprehend the world as\nsomething the non-existence of which is not only conceivable, but indeed\npreferable to its existence. Therefore our wonder at it easily passes into\na brooding over the _fatality_ which could yet call forth its existence,\nand by virtue of which such stupendous power as is demanded for the\nproduction and maintenance of such a world could be directed so much\nagainst its own interest. The philosophical astonishment is therefore at\nbottom perplexed and melancholy; philosophy, like the overture to “Don\nJuan,” commences with a minor chord. It follows from this that it can\nneither be Spinozism nor optimism. The more special nature, which has just\nbeen indicated, of the astonishment which leads us to philosophise clearly\nsprings from the sight of the _suffering and the wickedness_ in the world,\nwhich, even if they were in the most just proportion to each other, and\nalso were far outweighed by good, are yet something which absolutely and\nin general ought not to be. But since now nothing can come out of nothing,\nthese also must have their germ in the origin or in the kernel of the\nworld itself. It is hard for us to assume this if we look at the\nmagnitude, the order and completeness, of the physical world, for it seems\nto us that what had the power to produce such a world must have been able\nto avoid the suffering and the wickedness. That assumption (the truest\nexpression of which is Ormuzd and Ahrimines), it is easy to conceive, is\nhardest of all for Theism. Therefore the freedom of the will was primarily\ninvented to account for wickedness. But this is only a concealed way of\nmaking something out of nothing, for it assumes an _Operari_ that\nproceeded from no _Esse_ (see Die beiden _Grundprobleme der Ethik_, p. 58,\n_et seq._; second edition, p. 57 _et seq._.) Then it was sought to get rid\nof evil by attributing it to matter, or to unavoidable necessity, whereby\nthe devil, who is really the right _Expediens ad hoc_, was unwillingly set\naside. To evil also belongs _death_; but wickedness is only the throwing\nof the existing evil from oneself on to another. Thus, as was said above,\nit is wickedness, evil, and death that qualify and intensify the\nphilosophical astonishment. Not merely that the world exists, but still\nmore that it is such a wretched world, is the _punctum pruriens_ of\nmetaphysics, the problem which awakens in mankind an unrest that cannot be\nquieted by scepticism nor yet by criticism.\n\nWe find _physics_ also (in the widest sense of the word) occupied with the\nexplanation of the phenomena in the world. But it lies in the very nature\nof its explanations themselves that they cannot be sufficient. Physics\ncannot stand on its own feet, but requires a metaphysic to lean upon,\nwhatever airs it may give itself towards the latter. For it explains the\nphenomena by something still more unknown than they are themselves; by\nlaws of nature, resting upon forces of nature, to which the power of life\nalso belongs. Certainly the whole present condition of all things in the\nworld, or in nature, must necessarily be explicable from purely physical\ncauses. But such an explanation—supposing one actually succeeded so far as\nto be able to give it—must always just as necessarily be tainted with two\nimperfections (as it were with two sores, or like Achilles with the\nvulnerable heel, or the devil with the horse’s hoof), on account of which\neverything so explained really remains still unexplained. First with this\nimperfection, that the _beginning_ of every explanatory chain of causes\nand effects, _i.e._, of connected changes, can absolutely _never_ be\nreached, but, just like the limits of the world in space and time,\nunceasingly recedes _in infinito_. Secondly with this, that the whole of\nthe efficient causes out of which everything is explained constantly rest\nupon something which is completely inexplicable, the original _qualities_\nof things and the _natural forces_ which play a prominent part among them,\nby virtue of which they produce a specific kind of effect, _e.g._, weight,\nhardness, impulsive force, elasticity, warmth, electricity, chemical\nforces, &c., and which now remain in every explanation which is given,\nlike an unknown quantity, which absolutely cannot be eliminated, in an\notherwise perfectly solved algebraical equation. Accordingly there is no\nfragment of clay, however little worth, that is not entirely composed of\ninexplicable qualities. Thus these two inevitable defects in every purely\nphysical, _i.e._, causal, explanation show that such an explanation can\nonly be _relative_, and that its whole method and nature cannot be the\nonly one, the ultimate and thus the sufficient one, _i.e._, cannot be the\nmethod of explanation that can ever lead to the satisfactory solution of\nthe difficult riddle of things, and to the true understanding of the world\nand existence; but that the physical explanation in general and as such\nrequires further a _metaphysical_ explanation, which affords us the key to\nall its assumptions, but just on this account must necessarily follow\nquite a different path. The first step to this is that one should bring to\ndistinct consciousness and firmly retain the difference of the two, hence\nthe difference between _physics_ and _metaphysics_. It rests in general on\nthe Kantian distinction between _phenomenon_ and _thing in itself_. Just\nbecause Kant held the latter to be absolutely unknowable, there was,\naccording to him, no _metaphysics_, but merely immanent knowledge, _i.e._,\n_physics_, which throughout can speak only of phenomena, and also a\ncritique of the reason which strives after metaphysics. Here, however, in\norder to show the true point of connection between my philosophy and that\nof Kant, I shall anticipate the second book, and give prominence to the\nfact that Kant, in his beautiful exposition of the compatibility of\nfreedom and necessity (Critique of Pure Reason, first edition, p. 532-554;\nand Critique of Practical Reason, p. 224-231 of Rosenkranz’s edition),\nshows how one and the same action may in one aspect be perfectly\nexplicable as necessarily arising from the character of the man, the\ninfluence to which he has been subject in the course of his life, and the\nmotives which are now present to him, but yet in another aspect must be\nregarded as the work of his free will; and in the same sense he says, § 53\nof the “Prolegomena:” “Certainly natural necessity will belong to every\nconnection of cause and effect in the world of sense; yet, on the other\nhand, freedom will be conceded to that cause which is not itself a\nphenomenon (though indeed it is the ground of phenomena), thus nature and\nfreedom may without contradiction be attributed to the same thing, but in\na different reference—in the one case as a phenomenon, in the other case\nas a thing in itself.” What, then, Kant teaches of the phenomenon of man\nand his action my teaching extends to _all_ phenomena in nature, in that\nit makes the _will_ as a thing in itself their foundation. This proceeding\nis justified first of all by the fact that it must not be assumed that man\nis specifically _toto genere_ radically different from the other beings\nand things in nature, but rather that he is different only in degree. I\nturn back from this premature digression to our consideration of the\ninadequacy of physics to afford us the ultimate explanation of things. I\nsay, then, everything certainly is physical, but yet nothing is explicable\nphysically. As for the motion of the projected bullet, so also for the\nthinking of the brain, a physical explanation must ultimately be in itself\npossible, which would make the latter just as comprehensible as is the\nformer. But even the former, which we imagine we understand so perfectly,\nis at bottom as obscure to us as the latter; for what the inner nature of\nexpansion in space may be—of impenetrability, mobility, hardness,\nelasticity, and gravity remains, after all physical explanations, a\nmystery, just as much as thought. But because in the case of thought the\ninexplicable appears most immediately, a spring was at once made here from\nphysics to metaphysics, and a substance of quite a different kind from all\ncorporeal substances was hypostatised—a soul was set up in the brain. But\nif one had not been so dull as only to be capable of being struck by the\nmost remarkable of phenomena, one would have had to explain digestion by a\nsoul in the stomach, vegetation by a soul in the plant, affinity by a soul\nin the reagents, nay, the falling of a stone by a soul in the stone. For\nthe quality of every unorganised body is just as mysterious as the life in\nthe living body. In the same way, therefore, the physical explanation\nstrikes everywhere upon what is metaphysical, by which it is annihilated,\n_i.e._, it ceases to be explanation. Strictly speaking, it may be asserted\nthat no natural science really achieves anything more than what is also\nachieved by Botany: the bringing together of similars, classification. A\nphysical system which asserted that its explanations of things—in the\nparticular from causes, and in general from forces—were really sufficient,\nand thus exhausted the nature of the world, would be the true\n_Naturalism_. From Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus down to the\n_Système de la Nature_, and further, to Delamark, Cabanis, and to the\nmaterialism that has again been warmed up in the last few years, we can\ntrace the persistent attempt to set up a _system of physics without\nmetaphysics_, that is, a system which would make the phenomenon the thing\nin itself. But all their explanations seek to conceal from the explainers\nthemselves and from others that they simply assume the principal matter\nwithout more ado. They endeavour to show that all phenomena, even those of\nmind, are physical. And they are right; only they do not see that all that\nis physical is in another aspect also metaphysical. But, without Kant,\nthis is indeed difficult to see, for it presupposes the distinction of the\nphenomenon from the thing in itself. Yet without this Aristotle, much as\nhe was inclined to empiricism, and far as he was removed from the Platonic\nhyper-physics, kept himself free from this limited point of view. He says:\n“Ει μεν ουν μη εστι τις ἑτερα ουσια παρα τας φυσει συνεστηκυιας, ἡ φυσικη\nαν ειη πρωτη επιστημη; ει δε εστι τις ουσια ακινητος, αὑτη προτερα και\nφιλοσοφια πρωτη, και καθολου οὑτως, ὁτι πρωτη; και περι του οντοσ ᾑ ον,\nταυτης αν ειη θεωρησαι.” (_Si igitur non est aliqua alia substantia,\nprœter eas, quœ natura consistunt, physica profecto prima scientia esset:\nquodsi autem est aliqua substantia immobilis, hœc prior et philosophia\nprima, et universalis sic, quod prima; et de ente, prout ens est,\nspeculari hujus est_), “Metaph.,” V. 1. Such an _absolute system of\nphysics_ as is described above, which leaves room for no _metaphysics_,\nwould make the _Natura naturata_ into the _Natura naturans_; it would be\nphysics established on the throne of metaphysics, yet it would comport\nitself in this high position almost like Holberg’s theatrical would-be\npolitician who was made burgomaster. Indeed behind the reproach of\natheism, in itself absurd, and for the most part malicious, there lies, as\nits inner meaning and truth, which gives it strength, the obscure\nconception of such an absolute system of physics without metaphysics.\nCertainly such a system would necessarily be destructive of ethics; and\nwhile Theism has falsely been held to be inseparable from morality, this\nis really true only of _metaphysics in general_, _i.e._, of the knowledge\nthat the order of nature is not the only and absolute order of things.\nTherefore we may set up this as the necessary _Credo_ of all just and good\nmen: “I believe in metaphysics.” In this respect it is important and\nnecessary that one should convince oneself of the untenable nature of an\n_absolute system of physics_, all the more as this, the true _naturalism_,\nis a point of view which of its own accord and ever anew presses itself\nupon a man, and can only be done away with through profound speculation.\nIn this respect, however, all kinds of systems and faiths, so far and so\nlong as they are accepted, certainly serve as a substitute for such\nspeculation. But that a fundamentally false view presses itself upon man\nof its own accord, and must first be skilfully removed, is explicable from\nthe fact that the intellect is not originally intended to instruct us\nconcerning the nature of things, but only to show us their relations, with\nreference to our will; it is, as we shall find in the second book, only\nthe medium of motives. Now, that the world schematises itself in the\nintellect in a manner which exhibits quite a different order of things\nfrom the absolutely true one, because it shows us, not their kernel, but\nonly their outer shell, happens accidentally, and cannot be used as a\nreproach to the intellect; all the less as it nevertheless finds in itself\nthe means of rectifying this error, in that it arrives at the distinction\nbetween the phenomenal appearance and the inner being of things, which\ndistinction existed in substance at all times, only for the most part was\nvery imperfectly brought to consciousness, and therefore was inadequately\nexpressed, indeed often appeared in strange clothing. The Christian\nmystics, when they call it the _light of nature_, declare the intellect to\nbe inadequate to the comprehension of the true nature of things. It is, as\nit were, a mere surface force, like electricity, and does not penetrate to\nthe inner being.\n\nThe insufficiency of pure naturalism appears, as we have said, first of\nall, on the empirical path itself, through the circumstance that every\nphysical explanation explains the particular from its cause; but the chain\nof these causes, as we know _a priori_, and therefore with perfect\ncertainty, runs back to infinity, so that absolutely no cause could ever\nbe the first. Then, however, the effect of every cause is referred to a\nlaw of nature, and this finally to a force of nature, which now remains as\nthe absolutely inexplicable. But this inexplicable, to which all phenomena\nof this so clearly given and naturally explicable world, from the highest\nto the lowest, are referred, just shows that the whole nature of such\nexplanation is only conditional, as it were only _ex concessis_, and by no\nmeans the true and sufficient one; therefore I said above that physically\neverything and nothing is explicable. That absolutely inexplicable element\nwhich pervades all phenomena, which is most striking in the highest,\n_e.g._, in generation, but yet is just as truly present in the lowest,\n_e.g._, in mechanical phenomena, points to an entirely different kind of\norder of things lying at the foundation of the physical order, which is\njust what Kant calls the order of things in themselves, and which is the\ngoal of metaphysics. But, secondly, the insufficiency of pure naturalism\ncomes out clearly from that fundamental philosophical truth, which we have\nfully considered in the first half of this book, and which is also the\ntheme of the “Critique of Pure Reason;” the truth that every _object_,\nboth as regards its objective existence in general and as regards the\nmanner (forms) of this existence, is throughout conditioned by the knowing\n_subject_, hence is merely a phenomenon, not a thing in itself. This is\nexplained in § 7 of the first volume, and it is there shown that nothing\ncan be more clumsy than that, after the manner of all materialists, one\nshould blindly take the objective as simply given in order to derive\neverything from it without paying any regard to the subjective, through\nwhich, however, nay, in which alone the former exists. Samples of this\nprocedure are most readily afforded us by the fashionable materialism of\nour own day, which has thereby become a philosophy well suited for\nbarbers’ and apothecaries’ apprentices. For it, in its innocence, matter,\nassumed without reflection as absolutely real, is the thing in self, and\nthe one capacity of a thing in itself is impulsive force, for all other\nqualities can only be manifestations of this.\n\nWith naturalism, then, or the purely physical way of looking at things, we\nshall never attain our end; it is like a sum that never comes out. Causal\nseries without beginning or end, fundamental forces which are inscrutable,\nendless space, beginningless time, infinite divisibility of matter, and\nall this further conditioned by a knowing brain, in which alone it exists\njust like a dream, and without which it vanishes—constitute the labyrinth\nin which naturalism leads us ceaselessly round. The height to which in our\ntime the natural sciences have risen in this respect entirely throws into\nthe shade all previous centuries, and is a summit which mankind reaches\nfor the first time. But however great are the advances which _physics_\n(understood in the wide sense of the ancients) may make, not the smallest\nstep towards _metaphysics_ is thereby taken, just as a plane can never\nobtain cubical content by being indefinitely extended. For all such\nadvances will only perfect our knowledge of the _phenomenon_; while\n_metaphysics_ strives to pass beyond the phenomenal appearance itself, to\nthat which so appears. And if indeed it had the assistance of an entire\nand complete experience, it would, as regards the main point, be in no way\nadvantaged by it. Nay, even if one wandered through all the planets and\nfixed stars, one would thereby have made no step in _metaphysics_. It is\nrather the case that the greatest advances of physics will make the need\nof metaphysics ever more felt; for it is just the corrected, extended, and\nmore thorough knowledge of nature which, on the one hand, always\nundermines and ultimately overthrows the metaphysical assumptions which\ntill then have prevailed, but, on the other hand, presents the problem of\nmetaphysics itself more distinctly, more correctly, and more fully, and\nseparates it more clearly from all that is merely physical; moreover, the\nmore perfectly and accurately known nature of the particular thing more\npressingly demands the explanation of the whole and the general, which,\nthe more correctly, thoroughly, and completely it is known empirically,\nonly presents itself as the more mysterious. Certainly the individual,\nsimple investigator of nature, in a special branch of physics, does not at\nonce become clearly conscious of all this; he rather sleeps contentedly by\nthe side of his chosen maid, in the house of Odysseus, banishing all\nthoughts of Penelope (cf. ch. 12 at the end). Hence we see at the present\nday the _husk of nature_ investigated in its minutest details, the\nintestines of intestinal worms and the vermin of vermin known to a nicety.\nBut if some one comes, as, for example, I do, and speaks of the _kernel of\nnature_, they will not listen; they even think it has nothing to do with\nthe matter, and go on sifting their husks. One finds oneself tempted to\ncall that over-microscopical and micrological investigator of nature the\ncotquean of nature. But those persons who believe that crucibles and\nretorts are the true and only source of all wisdom are in their own way\njust as perverse as were formerly their antipodes the Scholastics. As the\nlatter, absolutely confined to their abstract conceptions, used these as\ntheir weapons, neither knowing nor investigating anything outside them, so\nthe former, absolutely confined to their empiricism, allow nothing to be\ntrue except what their eyes behold, and believe they can thus arrive at\nthe ultimate ground of things, not discerning that between the phenomenon\nand that which manifests itself in it, the thing in itself, there is a\ndeep gulf, a radical difference, which can only be cleared up by the\nknowledge and accurate delimitation of the subjective element of the\nphenomenon, and the insight that the ultimate and most important\nconclusions concerning the nature of things can only be drawn from\nself-consciousness; yet without all this one cannot advance a step beyond\nwhat is directly given to the senses, thus can get no further than to the\nproblem. Yet, on the other hand, it is to be observed that the most\nperfect possible knowledge of nature is the corrected _statement of the\nproblem_ of metaphysics. Therefore no one ought to venture upon this\nwithout having first acquired a knowledge of all the branches of natural\nscience, which, though general, shall be thorough, clear, and connected.\nFor the problem must precede its solution. Then, however, the investigator\nmust turn his glance inward; for the intellectual and ethical phenomena\nare more important than the physical, in the same proportion as, for\nexample, animal magnetism is a far more important phenomenon than mineral\nmagnetism. The last fundamental secret man carries within himself, and\nthis is accessible to him in the most immediate manner; therefore it is\nonly here that he can hope to find the key to the riddle of the world and\ngain a clue to the nature of all things. The special province of\nmetaphysics thus certainly lies in what has been called mental philosophy.\n\n    “The ranks of living creatures thou dost lead\n    Before me, teaching me to know my brothers\n    In air and water and the silent wood:\n\n    Then to the cave secure thou leadest me,\n    Then show’st me mine own self, and in my breast\n    The deep, mysterious miracles unfold.”(28)\n\nFinally, then, as regards the _source or the foundation_ of metaphysical\nknowledge, I have already declared myself above to be opposed to the\nassumption, which is even repeated by Kant, that it must lie _in mere\nconceptions_. In no knowledge can conceptions be what is first; for they\nare always derived from some perception. What has led, however, to that\nassumption is probably the example of mathematics. Mathematics can leave\nperception altogether, and, as is especially the case in algebra,\ntrigonometry, and analysis, can operate with purely abstract conceptions,\nnay, with conceptions which are represented only by signs instead of\nwords, and can yet arrive at a perfectly certain result, which is still so\nremote that any one who adhered to the firm ground of perception could not\narrive at it. But the possibility of this depends, as Kant has clearly\nshown, on the fact that the conceptions of mathematics are derived from\nthe most certain and definite of all perceptions, from the _a priori_ and\nyet intuitively known relations of quantity, and can therefore be\nconstantly realised again and controlled by these, either arithmetically,\nby performing the calculations which are merely indicated by those signs,\nor geometrically, by means of what Kant calls the construction of the\nconceptions. This advantage, on the other hand, is not possessed by the\nconceptions out of which it was believed metaphysics could be built up;\nsuch, for example, as essence, being, substance, perfection, necessity,\nreality, finite, infinite, absolute, ground, &c. For such conceptions are\nby no means original, as fallen from heaven, or innate; but they also,\nlike all conceptions, are derived from perceptions; and as, unlike the\nconceptions of mathematics, they do not contain the mere form of\nperception, but more, empirical perceptions must lie at their foundation.\nThus nothing can be drawn from them which the empirical perceptions did\nnot also contain, that is, nothing which was not a matter of experience,\nand which, since these conceptions are very wide abstractions, we would\nreceive with much greater certainty at first hand from experience. For\nfrom conceptions nothing more can ever be drawn than the perceptions from\nwhich they are derived contain. If we desire pure conceptions, _i.e._,\nsuch as have no empirical source, the only ones that can be produced are\nthose which concern space and time, _i.e._, the merely formal part of\nperception, consequently only the mathematical conceptions, or at most\nalso the conception of causality, which indeed does not originate in\nexperience, but yet only comes into consciousness by means of it (first in\nsense-perception); therefore experience indeed is only possible by means\nof it; but it also is only valid in the sphere of experience, on which\naccount Kant has shown that it only serves to communicate the connection\nof experience, and not to transcend it; that thus it admits only of\nphysical application, not of metaphysical. Certainly only its _a priori_\norigin can give apodictic certainty to any knowledge; but this limits it\nto the mere _form_ of experience in general, for it shows that it is\nconditioned by the subjective nature of the intellect. Such knowledge,\nthen, far from taking us beyond experience, gives only one _part_ of\nexperience itself, the _formal_ part, which belongs to it throughout, and\ntherefore is universal, consequently mere form without content. Since now\nmetaphysics can least of all be confined to this, it must have also\n_empirical_ sources of knowledge; therefore that preconceived idea of a\nmetaphysic to be found purely _a priori_ is necessarily vain. It is really\na _petitio principii_ of Kant’s, which he expresses most distinctly in § 1\nof the Prolegomena, that metaphysics must not draw its fundamental\nconceptions and principles from experience. In this it is assumed\nbeforehand that only what we knew _before_ all experience can extend\nbeyond all possible experience. Supported by this, Kant then comes and\nshows that all such knowledge is nothing more than the form of the\nintellect for the purpose of experience, and consequently can never lead\nbeyond experience, from which he then rightly deduces the impossibility of\nall metaphysics. But does it not rather seem utterly perverse that in\norder to discover the secret of experience, _i.e._, of the world which\nalone lies before us, we should look quite away from it, ignore its\ncontent, and take and use for its material only the empty forms of which\nwe are conscious _a priori_? Is it not rather in keeping with the matter\nthat _the science of experience in general_, and as such, should also be\ndrawn from experience? Its problem itself is given it empirically; why\nshould not the solution of it call in the assistance of experience? Is it\nnot senseless that he who speaks of the nature of things should not look\nat things themselves, but should confine himself to certain abstract\nconceptions? The task of metaphysics is certainly not the observation of\nparticular experiences, but yet it is the correct explanation of\nexperience as a whole. Its foundation must therefore, at any rate, be of\nan empirical nature. Indeed the _a priori_ nature of a part of human\nknowledge will be apprehended by it as a given _fact_, from which it will\ninfer the subjective origin of the same. Only because the consciousness of\nits _a priori_ nature accompanies it is it called by Kant _transcendental_\nas distinguished from _transcendent_, which signifies “passing beyond all\npossibility of experience,” and has its opposite in _immanent_, _i.e._,\nremaining within the limits of experience. I gladly recall the original\nmeaning of this expression introduced by Kant, with which, as also with\nthat of the Categories, and many others, the apes of philosophy carry on\ntheir game at the present day. Now, besides this, the source of the\nknowledge of metaphysics is not _outer_ experience alone, but also\n_inner_. Indeed, what is most peculiar to it, that by which the decisive\nstep which alone can solve the great question becomes possible for it,\nconsists, as I have fully and thoroughly proved in “_Ueber den Willen in\nder Natur_,” under the heading, “_Physische Astronomie_,” in this, that at\nthe right place it combines outer experience with inner, and uses the\nlatter as a key to the former.\n\nThe origin of metaphysics in empirical sources of knowledge, which is here\nset forth, and which cannot fairly be denied, deprives it certainly of\nthat kind of apodictic certainty which is only possible through knowledge\n_a priori_. This remains the possession of logic and mathematics—sciences,\nhowever, which really only teach what every one knows already, though not\ndistinctly. At most the primary elements of natural science may also be\ndeduced from knowledge _a priori_. By this confession metaphysics only\nsurrenders an ancient claim, which, according to what has been said above,\nrested upon misunderstanding, and against which the great diversity and\nchangeableness of metaphysical systems, and also the constantly\naccompanying scepticism, in every age has testified. Yet against the\npossibility of metaphysics in general this changeableness cannot be urged,\nfor the same thing affects just as much all branches of natural science,\nchemistry, physics, geology, zoology, &c., and even history has not\nremained exempt from it. But when once, as far as the limits of human\nintellect allow, a true system of metaphysics shall have been found, the\nunchangeableness of a science which is known _a priori_ will yet belong to\nit; for its foundation can only be _experience in general_, and not the\nparticular and special experiences by which, on the other hand, the\nnatural sciences are constantly modified and new material is always being\nprovided for history. For experience as a whole and in general will never\nchange its character for a new one.\n\nThe next question is: How can a science drawn from experience pass beyond\nit and so merit the name of metaphysics? It cannot do so perhaps in the\nsame way as we find a fourth number from three proportionate ones, or a\ntriangle from two sides and an angle. This was the way of the pre-Kantian\ndogmatism, which, according to certain laws known to us _a priori_, sought\nto reason from the given to the not given, from the consequent to the\nreason, thus from experience to that which could not possibly be given in\nany experience. Kant proved the impossibility of a metaphysic upon this\npath, in that he showed that although these laws were not drawn from\nexperience, they were only valid for experience. He therefore rightly\ntaught that in such a way we cannot transcend the possibility of all\nexperience. But there are other paths to metaphysics. The whole of\nexperience is like a cryptograph, and philosophy the deciphering of it,\nthe correctness of which is proved by the connection appearing everywhere.\nIf this whole is only profoundly enough comprehended, and the inner\nexperience is connected with the outer, it must be capable of being\n_interpreted_, _explained_ from itself. Since Kant has irrefutably proved\nto us that experience in general proceeds from two elements, the forms of\nknowledge and the inner nature of things, and that these two may be\ndistinguished in experience from each other, as that of which we are\nconscious _a priori_ and that which is added _a posteriori_, it is\npossible, at least in general, to say, what in the given experience, which\nis primarily merely phenomenal, belongs to the _form_ of this phenomenon,\nconditioned by the intellect, and what, after deducting this, remains over\nfor the _thing in itself_. And although no one can discern the thing in\nitself through the veil of the forms of perception, on the other hand\nevery one carries it in himself, indeed is it himself; therefore in\nself-consciousness it must be in some way accessible to him, even though\nonly conditionally. Thus the bridge by which metaphysics passes beyond\nexperience is nothing else than that analysis of experience into\nphenomenon and thing in itself in which I have placed Kant’s greatest\nmerit. For it contains the proof of a kernel of the phenomenon different\nfrom the phenomenon itself. This can indeed never be entirely separated\nfrom the phenomenon and regarded in itself as an _ens extramundanum_, but\nis always known only in its relations to and connections with the\nphenomenon itself. But the interpretation and explanation of the latter,\nin relation to the former, which is its inner kernel, is capable of\naffording us information with regard to it which does not otherwise come\ninto consciousness. In this sense, then, metaphysics goes beyond the\nphenomenon, _i.e._, nature, to that which is concealed in or behind it (το\nμετα το φυσικον), always regarding it, however, merely as that which\nmanifests itself in the phenomenon, not as independent of all phenomenal\nappearance; it therefore remains immanent, and does not become\ntranscendent. For it never disengages itself entirely from experience, but\nremains merely its interpretation and explanation, since it never speaks\nof the thing in itself otherwise than in its relation to the phenomenon.\nThis at least is the sense in which I, with reference throughout to the\nlimitations of human knowledge proved by Kant, have attempted to solve the\nproblem of metaphysics. Therefore his Prolegomena to future metaphysics\nwill be valid and suitable for mine also. Accordingly it never really goes\nbeyond experience, but only discloses the true understanding of the world\nwhich lies before it in experience. It is neither, according to the\ndefinition of metaphysics which even Kant repeats, a science of mere\nconceptions, nor is it a system of deductions from _a priori_ principles,\nthe uselessness of which for the _end_ of metaphysics has been shown by\nKant. But it is rational knowledge, drawn from perception of the external\nactual world and the information which the most intimate fact of\nself-consciousness affords us concerning it, deposited in distinct\nconceptions. It is accordingly the science of experience; but its subject\nand its source is not particular experiences, but the totality of all\nexperience. I completely accept Kant’s doctrine that the world of\nexperience is merely phenomenal, and that the _a priori_ knowledge is\nvalid only in relation to phenomena; but I add that just as phenomenal\nappearance, it is the manifestation of that which appears, and with him I\ncall this the thing in itself. This must therefore express its nature and\ncharacter in the world of experience, and consequently it must be possible\nto interpret these from this world, and indeed from the matter, not the\nmere form, of experience. Accordingly philosophy is nothing but the\ncorrect and universal understanding of experience itself, the true\nexposition of its meaning and content. To this the metaphysical, _i.e._,\nthat which is merely clothed in the phenomenon and veiled in its forms, is\nthat which is related to it as thought to words.\n\nSuch a deciphering of the world with reference to that which manifests\nitself in it must receive its confirmation from itself, through the\nagreement with each other in which it places the very diverse phenomena of\nthe world, and which without it we do not perceive. If we find a document\nthe alphabet of which is unknown, we endeavour to make it out until we hit\nupon an hypothesis as to the significance of the letters in accordance\nwith which they make up comprehensible words and connected sentences.\nThen, however, there remains no doubt as to the correctness of the\ndeciphering, because it is not possible that the agreement and connection\nin which all the letters of that writing are placed by this explanation is\nmerely accidental, and that by attributing quite a different value to the\nletters we could also recognise words and sentences in this arrangement of\nthem. In the same way the deciphering of the world must completely prove\nitself from itself. It must throw equal light upon all the phenomena of\nthe world, and also bring the most heterogeneous into agreement, so that\nthe contradiction between those which are most in contrast may be\nabolished. This proof from itself is the mark of genuineness. For every\nfalse deciphering, even if it is suitable for some phenomena, will\nconflict all the more glaringly with the rest. So, for example, the\noptimism of Leibnitz conflicts with the palpable misery of existence; the\ndoctrine of Spinoza, that the world is the only possible and absolutely\nnecessary substance, is incompatible with our wonder at its existence and\nnature; the Wolfian doctrine, that man obtains his _Existentia_ and\n_Essentia_ from a will foreign to himself, is contradicted by our moral\nresponsibility for the actions which proceed with strict necessity from\nthese, in conflict with the motives; the oft-repeated doctrine of the\nprogressive development of man to an ever higher perfection, or in general\nof any kind of becoming by means of the process of the world, is opposed\nto the _a priori_ knowledge that at any point of time an infinite time has\nalready run its course, and consequently all that is supposed to come with\ntime would necessarily have already existed; and in this way an\ninterminable list might be given of the contradictions of dogmatic\nassumptions with the given reality of things. On the other hand, I must\ndeny that any doctrine of my philosophy could fairly be added to such a\nlist, because each of them has been thought out in the presence of the\nperceived reality, and none of them has its root in abstract conceptions\nalone. There is yet in it a fundamental thought which is applied to all\nthe phenomena of the world as their key; but it proves itself to be the\nright alphabet at the application of which all words and sentences have\nsense and significance. The discovered answer to a riddle shows itself to\nbe the right one by the fact that all that is said in the riddle is\nsuitable to it. In the same way my doctrine introduces agreement and\nconnection into the confusion of the contrasting phenomena of this world,\nand solves the innumerable contradictions which, when regarded from any\nother point of view, it presents. Therefore, so far, it is like a sum that\ncomes out right, yet by no means in the sense that it leaves no problem\nover to solve, no possible question unanswered. To assert anything of that\nsort would be a presumptuous denial of the limits of human knowledge in\ngeneral. Whatever torch we may kindle, and whatever space it may light,\nour horizon will always remain bounded by profound night. For the ultimate\nsolution of the riddle of the world must necessarily be concerned with the\nthings in themselves, no longer with the phenomena. But all our forms of\nknowledge are adapted to the phenomena alone; therefore we must comprehend\neverything through coexistence, succession, and causal relations. These\nforms, however, have meaning and significance only with reference to the\nphenomenon; the things in themselves and their possible relations cannot\nbe apprehended by means of those forms. Therefore the actual, positive\nsolution of the riddle of the world must be something that human intellect\nis absolutely incapable of grasping and thinking; so that if a being of a\nhigher kind were to come and take all pains to impart it to us, we would\nbe absolutely incapable of understanding anything of his expositions.\nThose, therefore, who profess to know the ultimate, _i.e._, the first\nground of things, thus a primordial being, an absolute, or whatever else\nthey choose to call it, together with the process, the reasons, motives,\nor whatever it may be, in consequence of which the world arises from it,\nor springs, or falls, or is produced, set in existence, “discharged,” and\nushered forth, are playing tricks, are vain boasters, when indeed they are\nnot charlatans.\n\nI regard it as a great excellence of my philosophy that all its truths\nhave been found independently of each other, by contemplation of the real\nworld; but their unity and agreement, about which I had been unconcerned,\nhas always afterwards appeared of itself. Hence also it is rich, and has\nwide-spreading roots in the ground of perceptible reality, from which all\nnourishment of abstract truths springs; and hence, again, it is not\nwearisome—a quality which, to judge from the philosophical writings of the\nlast fifty years, one might regard as essential to philosophy. If, on the\nother hand, all the doctrines of a philosophy are merely deduced the one\nout of the other, and ultimately indeed all out of one first principle, it\nmust be poor and meagre, and consequently wearisome, for nothing can\nfollow from a proposition except what it really already says itself.\nMoreover, in this case everything depends upon the correctness of _one_\nproposition, and by a single mistake in the deduction the truth of the\nwhole would be endangered. Still less security is given by the systems\nwhich start from an intellectual intuition, _i.e._, a kind of ecstasy or\nclairvoyance. All knowledge so obtained must be rejected as subjective,\nindividual, and consequently problematical. Even if it actually existed it\nwould not be communicable, for only the normal knowledge of the brain is\ncommunicable; if it is abstract, through conceptions and words; if purely\nperceptible or concrete, through works of art.\n\nIf, as so often happens, metaphysics is reproached with having made so\nlittle progress, it ought also to be considered that no other science has\ngrown up like it under constant oppression, none has been so hampered and\nhindered from without as it has always been by the religion of every land,\nwhich, everywhere in possession of a monopoly of metaphysical knowledge,\nregards metaphysics as a weed growing beside it, as an unlicensed worker,\nas a horde of gipsies, and as a rule tolerates it only under the condition\nthat it accommodates itself to serve and follow it. For where has there\never been true freedom of thought? It has been vaunted sufficiently; but\nwhenever it wishes to go further than perhaps to differ about the\nsubordinate dogmas of the religion of the country, a holy shudder seizes\nthe prophets of tolerance, and they say: “Not a step further!” What\nprogress of metaphysics was possible under such oppression? Nay, this\nconstraint which the privileged metaphysics exercises is not confined to\nthe _communication_ of thoughts, but extends to _thinking_ itself, for its\ndogmas are so firmly imprinted in the tender, plastic, trustful, and\nthoughtless age of childhood, with studied solemnity and serious airs,\nthat from that time forward they grow with the brain, and almost assume\nthe nature of innate thoughts, which some philosophers have therefore\nreally held them to be, and still more have pretended to do so. Yet\nnothing can so firmly resist the comprehension of even the _problem_ of\nmetaphysics as a previous solution of it intruded upon and early implanted\nin the mind. For the necessary starting-point for all genuine philosophy\nis the deep feeling of the Socratic: “This one thing I know, that I know\nnothing.” The ancients were in this respect in a better position than we\nare, for their national religions certainly limited somewhat the imparting\nof thoughts; but they did not interfere with the freedom of thought\nitself, because they were not formally and solemnly impressed upon\nchildren, and in general were not taken so seriously. Therefore in\nmetaphysics the ancients are still our teachers.\n\nWhenever metaphysics is reproached with its small progress, and with not\nhaving yet reached its goal in spite of such sustained efforts, one ought\nfurther to consider that in the meanwhile it has constantly performed the\ninvaluable service of limiting the boundless claims of the privileged\nmetaphysics, and yet at the same time combating naturalism and materialism\nproper, which are called forth by it as an inevitable reaction. Consider\nto what a pitch the arrogance of the priesthood of every religion would\nrise if the belief in their doctrines was as firm and blind as they really\nwish. Look back also at the wars, disturbances, rebellions, and\nrevolutions in Europe from the eighth to the eighteenth century; how few\nwill be found that have not had as their essence, or their pretext, some\ncontroversy about beliefs, thus a metaphysical problem, which became the\noccasion of exciting nations against each other. Yet is that whole\nthousand years a continual slaughter, now on the battlefield, now on the\nscaffold, now in the streets, in metaphysical interests! I wish I had an\nauthentic list of all crimes which Christianity has really prevented, and\nall good deeds it has really performed, that I might be able to place them\nin the other scale of the balance.\n\nLastly, as regards the _obligations_ of metaphysics, it has only one; for\nit is one which endures no other beside it—the obligation to be _true_. If\none would impose other obligations upon it besides this, such as to be\nspiritualistic, optimistic, monotheistic, or even only to be moral, one\ncannot know beforehand whether this would not interfere with the\nfulfilment of that first obligation, without which all its other\nachievements must clearly be worthless. A given philosophy has accordingly\nno other standard of its value than that of truth. For the rest,\nphilosophy is essentially _world-wisdom_: its problem is the world. It has\nto do with this alone, and leaves the gods in peace—expects, however, in\nreturn, to be left in peace by them.\n\nSUPPLEMENTS TO THE SECOND BOOK.\n\n    “Ihr folget falscher Spur,\n      Denkt nicht, wir scherzen!\n    Ist nicht der Kern der Natur\n      Menschen im Herzen?”\n\n    —Goethe.\n\nChapter XVIII.(29) On The Possibility Of Knowing The Thing In Itself.\n\nIn 1836 I already published, under the title “_Ueber den Willen in der\nNatur_” (second ed., 1854; third ed., 1867), the most essential supplement\nto this book, which contains the most peculiar and important step in my\nphilosophy, the transition from the phenomenon to the thing in itself,\nwhich Kant gave up as impossible. It would be a great mistake to regard\nthe foreign conclusions with which I have there connected my expositions\nas the real material and subject of that work, which, though small as\nregards its extent, is of weighty import. These conclusions are rather the\nmere occasion starting from which I have there expounded that fundamental\ntruth of my philosophy with so much greater clearness than anywhere else,\nand brought it down to the empirical knowledge of nature. And indeed this\nis done most exhaustively and stringently under the heading “_Physische\nAstronomie_;” so that I dare not hope ever to find a more correct or\naccurate expression of that core of my philosophy than is given there.\nWhoever desires to know my philosophy thoroughly and to test it seriously\nmust therefore give attention before everything to that section. Thus, in\ngeneral, all that is said in that little work would form the chief content\nof these supplements, if it had not to be excluded on account of having\npreceded them; but, on the other hand, I here take for granted that it is\nknown, for otherwise the very best would be wanting.\n\nI wish now first of all to make a few preliminary observations from a\ngeneral point of view as to the sense in which we can speak of a knowledge\nof the thing in itself and of its necessary limitation.\n\nWhat is _knowledge_? It is primarily and essentially _idea_. What is\n_idea_? A very complicated _physiological_ process in the brain of an\nanimal, the result of which is the consciousness of a _picture_ there.\nClearly the relation between such a picture and something entirely\ndifferent from the animal in whose brain it exists can only be a very\nindirect one. This is perhaps the simplest and most comprehensible way of\ndisclosing the _deep gulf between the ideal and the real_. This belongs to\nthe things of which, like the motion of the earth, we are not directly\nconscious; therefore the ancients did not observe it, just as they did not\nobserve the motion of the earth. Once pointed out, on the other hand,\nfirst by Descartes, it has ever since given philosophers no rest. But\nafter Kant had at last proved in the most thorough manner the complete\ndiversity of the ideal and the real, it was an attempt, as bold as it was\nabsurd, yet perfectly correctly calculated with reference to the\nphilosophical public in Germany, and consequently crowned with brilliant\nresults, to try to assert the _absolute identity_ of the two by dogmatic\nutterances, on the strength of a pretended intellectual intuition. In\ntruth, on the contrary, a subjective and an objective existence, a being\nfor self and a being for others, a consciousness of one’s own self, and a\nconsciousness of other things, is given us directly, and the two are given\nin such a fundamentally different manner that no other difference can\ncompare with this. About himself every one knows directly, about all\nothers only very indirectly. This is the fact and the problem.\n\nWhether, on the other hand, through further processes in the interior of a\nbrain, general conceptions (_Universalia_) are abstracted from the\nperceptible ideas or images that have arisen within it, for the assistance\nof further combinations, whereby knowledge becomes _rational_, and is now\ncalled _thinking_—this is here no longer the essential question, but is of\nsubordinate significance. For all such _conceptions_ receive their content\nonly from the perceptible idea, which is therefore _primary knowledge_,\nand has consequently alone to be taken account of in an investigation of\nthe relation between the ideal and the real. It therefore shows entire\nignorance of the problem, or at least it is very inept, to wish to define\nthat relation as that between _being_ and _thinking_. Thinking has\nprimarily only a relation to _perceiving_, but _perception_ has a relation\nto the _real being_ of what is perceived, and this last is the great\nproblem with which we are here concerned. Empirical being, on the other\nhand, as it lies before us, is nothing else than simply being given in\nperception; but the relation of the latter to _thinking_ is no riddle, for\nthe conceptions, thus the immediate materials of thought, are obviously\n_abstracted_ from perception, which no reasonable man can doubt. It may be\nsaid in passing that one can see how important the choice of expressions\nin philosophy is from the fact that that inept expression condemned above,\nand the misunderstanding which arose from it, became the foundation of the\nwhole Hegelian pseudo-philosophy, which has occupied the German public for\ntwenty-five years.\n\nIf, however, it should be said: “The perception is itself the knowledge of\nthe thing in itself: for it is the effect of that which is outside of us,\nand as this _acts_, so it _is_: its action is just its being;” to this we\nreply: (1.) that the law of causality, as has been sufficiently proved, is\nof subjective origin, as well as the sensation from which the perception\narises; (2.) that at any rate time and space, in which the object presents\nitself, are of subjective origin; (3.) that if the being of the object\nconsists simply in its action, this means that it consists merely in the\nchanges which it brings about in others; therefore itself and in itself it\nis nothing at all. Only of _matter_ is it true, as I have said in the\ntext, and worked out in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason,\nat the end of § 21, that its being consists in its action, that it is\nthrough and through only causality, thus is itself causality objectively\nregarded; hence, however, it is also nothing in itself (ἡ ὑλη το αληθινον\nψευδος, _materia mendacium verax_), but as an ingredient in the perceived\nobject, is a mere abstraction, which for itself alone can be given in no\nexperience. It will be fully considered later on in a chapter of its own.\nBut the perceived object must be something _in itself_, and not merely\nsomething _for others_. For otherwise it would be altogether merely idea,\nand we would have an absolute idealism, which would ultimately become\ntheoretical egoism, with which all reality disappears and the world\nbecomes a mere subjective phantasm. If, however, without further question,\nwe stop altogether at the _world as idea_, then certainly it is all one\nwhether I explain objects as ideas in my head or as phenomena exhibiting\nthemselves in time and space; for time and space themselves exist only in\nmy head. In this sense, then, an identity of the ideal and the real might\nalways be affirmed; only, after Kant, this would not be saying anything\nnew. Besides this, however, the nature of things and of the phenomenal\nworld would clearly not be thereby exhausted; but with it we would always\nremain still upon the ideal side. The _real_ side must be something _toto\ngenere_ different from _the world as idea_, it must be that which things\nare _in themselves_; and it is this entire diversity between the ideal and\nthe real which Kant has proved in the most thorough manner.\n\nLocke had denied to the senses the knowledge of things as they are in\nthemselves; but Kant denied this also to the perceiving _understanding_,\nunder which name I here comprehend what he calls the _pure_ sensibility,\nand, as it is given _a priori_, the law of causality which brings about\nthe empirical perception. Not only are both right, but we can also see\nquite directly that a contradiction lies in the assertion that a thing is\nknown as it is in and for itself, _i.e._, outside of knowledge. For all\nknowing is, as we have said, essentially a perceiving of ideas; but my\nperception of ideas, just because it is mine, can never be identical with\nthe inner nature of the thing outside of me. The being in and for itself,\nof everything, must necessarily be _subjective_; in the idea of another,\nhowever, it exists just as necessarily as _objective_—a difference which\ncan never be fully reconciled. For by it the whole nature of its existence\nis fundamentally changed; as objective it presupposes a foreign subject,\nas whose idea it exists, and, moreover, as Kant has shown, has entered\nforms which are foreign to its own nature, just because they belong to\nthat foreign subject, whose knowledge is only possible by means of them.\nIf I, absorbed in this reflection, perceive, let us say lifeless bodies,\nof easily surveyed magnitude and regular, comprehensible form, and now\nattempt to conceive this spatial existence, in its three dimensions, as\ntheir being in itself, consequently as the existence which to the things\nis subjective, the impossibility of the thing is at once apparent to me,\nfor I can never think those objective forms as the being which to the\nthings is subjective, rather I become directly conscious that what I there\nperceive is only a picture produced in my brain, and existing only for me\nas the knowing subject, which cannot constitute the ultimate, and\ntherefore subjective, being in and for itself of even these lifeless\nbodies. But, on the other hand, I must not assume that even these lifeless\nbodies exist only in my idea, but, since they have inscrutable qualities,\nand, by virtue of these, activity, I must concede to them a _being in\nitself_ of some kind. But this very inscrutableness of the properties,\nwhile, on the one hand, it certainly points to something which exists\nindependently of our knowledge, gives also, on the other hand, the\nempirical proof that our knowledge, because it consists simply in _framing\nideas_ by means of subjective forms, affords us always mere _phenomena_,\nnot the true being of things. This is the explanation of the fact that in\nall that we know there remains hidden from us a certain something, as\nquite inscrutable, and we are obliged to confess that we cannot thoroughly\nunderstand even the commonest and simplest phenomena. For it is not merely\nthe highest productions of nature, living creatures, or the _complicated_\nphenomena of the unorganised world that remain inscrutable to us, but even\nevery rock-crystal, every iron-pyrite, by reason of its\ncrystallographical, optical, chemical, and electrical properties, is to\nthe searching consideration and investigation an abyss of\nincomprehensibilities and mysteries. This could not be the case if we knew\nthings as they are in themselves; for then at least the simpler phenomena,\nthe path to whose qualities was not barred for us by ignorance, would\nnecessarily be thoroughly comprehensible to us, and their whole being and\nnature would be able to pass over into our knowledge. Thus it lies not in\nthe defectiveness of our acquaintance with things, but in the nature of\nknowledge itself. For if our perception, and consequently the whole\nempirical comprehension of the things that present themselves to us, is\nalready essentially and in the main determined by our faculty of\nknowledge, and conditioned by its forms and functions, it cannot but be\nthat things exhibit themselves in a manner which is quite different from\ntheir own inner nature, and therefore appear as in a mask, which allows us\nmerely to assume what is concealed beneath it, but never to know it;\nhence, then, it gleams through as an inscrutable mystery, and never can\nthe nature of anything entire and without reserve pass over into\nknowledge; but much less can any real thing be construed _a priori_, like\na mathematical problem. Thus the empirical inscrutableness of all natural\nthings is a proof _a posteriori_ of the ideality and merely\nphenomenal-actuality of their empirical existence.\n\nAccording to all this, upon the path of _objective knowledge_, hence\nstarting from the _idea_, one will never get beyond the idea, _i.e._, the\nphenomenon. One will thus remain at the outside of things, and will never\nbe able to penetrate to their inner nature and investigate what they are\nin themselves, _i.e._, for themselves. So far I agree with Kant. But, as\nthe counterpart of this truth, I have given prominence to this other\ntruth, that we are not merely the _knowing subject_, but, in another\naspect, we ourselves also belong to the inner nature that is to be known,\n_we ourselves are the thing in itself_; that therefore a _way from within_\nstands open for us to that inner nature belonging to things themselves, to\nwhich we cannot penetrate _from without_, as it were a subterranean\npassage, a secret alliance, which, as if by treachery, places us at once\nwithin the fortress which it was impossible to take by assault from\nwithout. The thing in itself can, as such, only come into consciousness\nquite directly, in this way, that _it is itself conscious of itself_: to\nwish to know it objectively is to desire something contradictory.\nEverything objective is idea, therefore appearance, mere phenomenon of the\nbrain.\n\nKant’s chief result may in substance be thus concisely stated: “All\nconceptions which have not at their foundation a perception in space and\ntime (sensuous intuition), that is to say then, which have not been drawn\nfrom such a perception, are absolutely empty, _i.e._, give no knowledge.\nBut since now perception can afford us only _phenomena_, not things in\nthemselves, we have also absolutely no knowledge of things in themselves.”\nI grant this of everything, with the single exception of the knowledge\nwhich each of us has of his own _willing_: this is neither a perception\n(for all perception is spatial) nor is it empty; rather it is more real\nthan any other. Further, it is not _a priori_, like merely formal\nknowledge, but entirely _a posteriori_; hence also we cannot anticipate it\nin the particular case, but are hereby often convicted of error concerning\nourselves. In fact, our _willing_ is the one opportunity which we have of\nunderstanding from within any event which exhibits itself without,\nconsequently the one thing which is known to us _immediately_, and not,\nlike all the rest, merely given in the idea. Here, then, lies the datum\nwhich alone is able to become the key to everything else, or, as I have\nsaid, the single narrow door to the truth. Accordingly we must learn to\nunderstand nature from ourselves, not conversely ourselves from nature.\nWhat is known to us immediately must give us the explanation of what we\nonly know indirectly, not conversely. Do we perhaps understand the rolling\nof a ball when it has received an impulse more thoroughly than our\nmovement when we feel a motive? Many may imagine so, but I say it is the\nreverse. Yet we shall attain to the knowledge that what is essential in\nboth the occurrences just mentioned is identical; although identical in\nthe same way as the lowest audible note of harmony is the same as the note\nof the same name ten octaves higher.\n\nMeanwhile it should be carefully observed, and I have always kept it in\nmind, that even the inward experience which we have of our own will by no\nmeans affords us an exhaustive and adequate knowledge of the thing in\nitself. This would be the case if it were entirely an immediate\nexperience; but it is effected in this way: the will, with and by means of\nthe corporisation, provides itself also with an intellect (for the sake of\nits relations to the external world), and through this now knows itself as\nwill in self-consciousness (the necessary counterpart of the external\nworld); this knowledge therefore of the thing in itself is not fully\nadequate. First of all, it is bound to the form of the idea, it is\napprehension, and as such falls asunder into subject and object. For even\nin self-consciousness the I is not absolutely simple, but consists of a\nknower, the intellect, and a known, the will. The former is not known, and\nthe latter does not know, though both unite in the consciousness of an I.\nBut just on this account that I is not thoroughly _intimate_ with itself,\nas it were transparent, but is opaque, and therefore remains a riddle to\nitself, thus even in inner knowledge there also exists a difference\nbetween the true being of its object and the apprehension of it in the\nknowing subject. Yet inner knowledge is free from two forms which belong\nto outer knowledge, the form of _space_ and the form of _causality_, which\nis the means of effecting all sense-perception. On the other hand, there\nstill remains the form of _time_, and that of being known and knowing in\ngeneral. Accordingly in this inner knowledge the thing in itself has\nindeed in great measure thrown off its veil, but still does not yet appear\nquite naked. In consequence of the form of time which still adheres to it,\nevery one knows his will only in its successive _acts_, and not as a\nwhole, in and for itself: therefore no one knows his character _a priori_,\nbut only learns it through experience and always incompletely. But yet the\napprehension, in which we know the affections and acts of our own will, is\nfar more immediate than any other. It is the point at which the thing in\nitself most directly enters the phenomenon and is most closely examined by\nthe knowing subject; therefore the event thus intimately known is alone\nfitted to become the interpreter of all others.\n\nFor in every emergence of an act of will from the obscure depths of our\ninner being into the knowing consciousness a direct transition occurs of\nthe thing in itself, which lies outside time, into the phenomenal world.\nAccordingly the act of will is indeed only the closest and most distinct\n_manifestation_ of the thing in itself; yet it follows from this that if\nall other manifestations or phenomena could be known by us as directly and\ninwardly, we would be obliged to assert them to be that which the will is\nin us. Thus in this sense I teach that the inner nature of everything is\n_will_, and I call will the thing in itself. Kant’s doctrine of the\nunknowableness of the thing in itself is hereby modified to this extent,\nthat the thing in itself is only not absolutely and from the very\nfoundation knowable, that yet by far the most immediate of its phenomena,\nwhich by this immediateness is _toto genere_ distinguished from all the\nrest, represents it for us; and accordingly we have to refer the whole\nworld of phenomena to that one in which the thing in itself appears in the\nvery thinnest of veils, and only still remains phenomenon in so far as my\nintellect, which alone is capable of knowledge, remains ever distinguished\nfrom me as the willing subject, and moreover does not even in _inner_\nperfection put off the form of knowledge of _time_.\n\nAccordingly, even after this last and furthest step, the question may\nstill be raised, what that will, which exhibits itself in the world and as\nthe world, ultimately and absolutely is in itself? _i.e._, what it is,\nregarded altogether apart from the fact that it exhibits itself as will,\nor in general _appears_, _i.e._, in general is _known_. This question can\nnever be answered: because, as we have said, becoming known is itself the\ncontradictory of being in itself, and everything that is known is as such\nonly phenomenal. But the possibility of this question shows that the thing\nin itself, which we know most directly in the will, may have, entirely\noutside all possible phenomenal appearance, ways of existing,\ndeterminations, qualities, which are absolutely unknowable and\nincomprehensible to us, and which remain as the nature of the thing in\nitself, when, as is explained in the fourth book, it has voluntarily\nabrogated itself as _will_, and has therefore retired altogether from the\nphenomenon, and for our knowledge, _i.e._, as regards the world of\nphenomena, has passed into empty nothingness. If the will were simply and\nabsolutely the thing in itself this nothing would also be _absolute_,\ninstead of which it expressly presents itself to us there as only\n_relative_.\n\nI now proceed to supplement with a few considerations pertinent to the\nsubject the exposition given both in our second book and in the work\n“_Ueber den Willen in der Natur_,” of the doctrine that what makes itself\nknown to us in the most immediate knowledge as will is also that which\nobjectifies itself at different grades in all the phenomena of this world;\nand I shall begin by citing a number of psychological facts which prove\nthat first of all in our own consciousness the will always appears as\nprimary and fundamental, and throughout asserts its superiority to the\nintellect, which, on the other hand, always presents itself as secondary,\nsubordinate, and conditioned. This proof is the more necessary as all\nphilosophers before me, from the first to the last, place the true being\nor the kernel of man in the _knowing_ consciousness, and accordingly have\nconceived and explained the I, or, in the case of many of them, its\ntranscendental hypostasis called soul, as primarily and essentially\n_knowing_, nay, _thinking_, and only in consequence of this, secondarily\nand derivatively, as _willing_. This ancient and universal radical error,\nthis enormous πρωτον ψευδος and fundamental ὑστερον προτερον, must before\neverything be set aside, and instead of it the true state of the case must\nbe brought to perfectly distinct consciousness. Since, however, this is\ndone here for the first time, after thousands of years of philosophising,\nsome fulness of statement will be appropriate. The remarkable phenomenon,\nthat in this most essential point all philosophers have erred, nay, have\nexactly reversed the truth, might, especially in the case of those of the\nChristian era, be partly explicable from the fact that they all had the\nintention of presenting man as distinguished as widely as possible from\nthe brutes, yet at the same time obscurely felt that the difference\nbetween them lies in the intellect, not in the will; whence there arose\nunconsciously within them an inclination to make the intellect the\nessential and principal thing, and even to explain volition as a mere\nfunction of the intellect. Hence also the conception of a soul is not only\ninadmissible, because it is a transcendent hypostasis, as is proved by the\n“Critique of Pure Reason,” but it becomes the source of irremediable\nerrors, because in its “simple substance” it establishes beforehand an\nindivisible unity of knowledge and will, the separation of which is just\nthe path to the truth. That conception must therefore appear no more in\nphilosophy, but may be left to German doctors and physiologists, who,\nafter they have laid aside scalpel and spattle, amuse themselves by\nphilosophising with the conceptions they received when they were\nconfirmed. They might certainly try their luck in England. The French\nphysiologists and zootomists have (till lately) kept themselves free from\nthat reproach.\n\nThe first consequence of their common fundamental error, which is very\ninconvenient to all these philosophers, is this: since in death the\nknowing consciousness obviously perishes, they must either allow death to\nbe the annihilation of the man, to which our inner being is opposed, or\nthey must have recourse to the assumption of a continued existence of the\nknowing consciousness, which requires a strong faith, for his own\nexperience has sufficiently proved to every one the thorough and complete\ndependence of the knowing consciousness upon the brain, and one can just\nas easily believe in digestion without a stomach as in a knowing\nconsciousness without a brain. My philosophy alone leads out of this\ndilemma, for it for the first time places the true being of man not in the\nconsciousness but in the will, which is not essentially bound up with\nconsciousness, but is related to consciousness, _i.e._, to knowledge, as\nsubstance to accident, as something illuminated to the light, as the\nstring to the resounding-board, and which enters consciousness from within\nas the corporeal world does from without. Now we can comprehend the\nindestructibleness of this our real kernel and true being, in spite of the\nevident ceasing of consciousness in death, and the corresponding\nnon-existence of it before birth. For the intellect is as perishable as\nthe brain, whose product or rather whose action it is. But the brain, like\nthe whole organism, is the product or phenomenon, in short, the\nsubordinate of the will, which alone is imperishable.\n\nChapter XIX.(30) On The Primacy Of The Will In Self-Consciousness.\n\nThe will, as the thing in itself, constitutes the inner, true, and\nindestructible nature of man; in itself, however, it is unconscious. For\nconsciousness is conditioned by the intellect, and the intellect is a mere\naccident of our being; for it is a function of the brain, which, together\nwith the nerves and spinal cord connected with it, is a mere fruit, a\nproduct, nay, so far, a parasite of the rest of the organism; for it does\nnot directly enter into its inner constitution, but merely serves the end\nof self-preservation by regulating the relations of the organism to the\nexternal world. The organism itself, on the other hand, is the visibility,\nthe objectivity, of the individual will, the image of it as it presents\nitself in that very brain (which in the first book we learned to recognise\nas the condition of the objective world in general), therefore also\nbrought about by its forms of knowledge, space, time, and causality, and\nconsequently presenting itself as extended, successively acting, and\nmaterial, _i.e._, as something operative or efficient. The members are\nboth directly felt and also perceived by means of the senses only in the\nbrain. According to this one may say: The intellect is the secondary\nphenomenon; the organism the primary phenomenon, that is, the immediate\nmanifestation of the will; the will is metaphysical, the intellect\nphysical;—the intellect, like its objects, is merely phenomenal\nappearance; the will alone is the thing in itself. Then, in a more and\nmore _figurative sense_, thus by way of simile: The will is the substance\nof man, the intellect the accident; the will is the matter, the intellect\nis the form; the will is warmth, the intellect is light.\n\nWe shall now first of all verify and also elucidate this thesis by the\nfollowing facts connected with the inner life of man; and on this\nopportunity perhaps more will be done for the knowledge of the inner man\nthan is to be found in many systematic psychologies.\n\n1. Not only the consciousness of other things, _i.e._, the apprehension of\nthe external world, but also _self-consciousness_, contains, as was\nmentioned already above, a knower and a known; otherwise it would not be\n_consciousness_. For _consciousness_ consists in knowing; but knowing\nrequires a knower and a known; therefore there could be no\nself-consciousness if there were not in it also a known opposed to the\nknower and different from it. As there can be no object without a subject,\nso also there can be no subject without an object, _i.e._, no knower\nwithout something different from it which is known. Therefore a\nconsciousness which is through and through pure intelligence is\nimpossible. The intelligence is like the sun, which does not illuminate\nspace if there is no object from which its rays are reflected. The knower\nhimself, as such, cannot be known; otherwise he would be the known of\nanother knower. But now, as the _known_ in self-consciousness we find\nexclusively the _will_. For not merely willing and purposing in the\nnarrowest sense, but also all striving, wishing, shunning, hoping,\nfearing, loving, hating, in short, all that directly constitutes our own\nweal and woe, desire and aversion, is clearly only affection of the will,\nis a moving, a modification of willing and not-willing, is just that\nwhich, if it takes outward effect, exhibits itself as an act of will\nproper.(31) In all knowledge, however, the known is first and essential,\nnot the knower; for the former is the πρωτοτυπος, the latter the εκτυπος.\nTherefore in self-consciousness also the known, thus the will, must be\nwhat is first and original; the knower, on the other hand, only what is\nsecondary, that which has been added, the mirror. They are related very\nmuch as the luminous to the reflecting body; or, again, as the vibrating\nstrings to the resounding-board, in which case the note produced would be\nconsciousness. We may also regard the plant as a like symbol of\nconsciousness. It has, we know, two poles, the root and the corona: the\nformer struggling into darkness, moisture, and cold, the latter into\nlight, dryness, and warmth; then, as the point of indifference of the two\npoles, where they part asunder, close to the ground, the collum\n(_rhizoma_, _le collet_). The root is what is essential, original,\nperennial, the death of which involves that of the corona, is thus the\nprimary; the corona, on the other hand, is the ostensible, but it has\nsprung from something else, and it passes away without the root dying; it\nis thus secondary. The root represents the will, the corona the intellect,\nand the point of indifference of the two, the collum, would be the _I_,\nwhich, as their common termination, belongs to both. This I is the _pro\ntempore_ identical subject of knowing and willing, whose identity I called\nin my very first essay (on the principle of sufficient reason), and in my\nfirst philosophical wonder, the miracle κατ εξοχην. It is the temporal\nstarting-point and connecting-link of the whole phenomenon, _i.e._, of the\nobjectification of the will: it conditions indeed the phenomenon, but is\nalso conditioned by it. This comparison may even be carried to the\nindividual nature of men. As a large corona commonly springs only from a\nlarge root, so the greatest intellectual capabilities are only found in\nconnection with a vehement and passionate will. A genius of a phlegmatic\ncharacter and weak passions would resemble those succulent plants that,\nwith a considerable corona consisting of thick leaves, have very small\nroots; will not, however, be found. That vehemence of will and\npassionateness of character are conditions of heightened intelligence\nexhibits itself physiologically through the fact that the activity of the\nbrain is conditioned by the movement which the great arteries running\ntowards the _basis cerebri_ impart to it with each pulsation; therefore an\nenergetic pulse, and even, according to Bichat, a short neck, is a\nrequisite of great activity of the brain. But the opposite of the above\ncertainly occurs: vehement desires, passionate, violent character, along\nwith weak intellect, _i.e._, a small brain of bad conformation in a thick\nskull. This is a phenomenon as common as it is repulsive: we might perhaps\ncompare it to beetroot.\n\n2. But in order not merely to describe consciousness figuratively, but to\nknow it thoroughly, we have first of all to find out what appears in the\nsame way in every consciousness, and therefore, as the common and constant\nelement, will also be the essential. Then we shall consider what\ndistinguishes _one_ consciousness from another, which accordingly will be\nthe adventitious and secondary element.\n\nConsciousness is positively only known to us as a property of animal\nnature; therefore we must not, and indeed cannot, think of it otherwise\nthan as _animal consciousness_, so that this expression is tautological.\nNow, that which in _every_ animal consciousness, even the most imperfect\nand the weakest, is always present, nay, lies at its foundation, is an\nimmediate sense of _longing_, and of the alternate satisfaction and\nnon-satisfaction of it, in very different degrees. This we know to a\ncertain extent _a priori_. For marvellously different as the innumerable\nspecies of animals are, and strange as some new form, never seen before,\nappears to us, we yet assume beforehand its inmost nature, with perfect\ncertainty, as well known, and indeed fully confided to us. We know that\nthe animal _wills_, indeed also _what_ it wills, existence, well-being,\nlife, and propagation; and since in this we presuppose with perfect\ncertainty identity with us, we do not hesitate to attribute to it\nunchanged all the affections of will which we know in ourselves, and speak\nat once of its desire, aversion, fear, anger, hatred, love, joy, sorrow,\nlonging, &c. On the other hand, whenever phenomena of mere knowledge come\nto be spoken of we fall at once into uncertainty. We do not venture to say\nthat the animal conceives, thinks, judges, knows: we only attribute to it\nwith certainty ideas in general; because without them its _will_ could not\nhave those emotions referred to above. But with regard to the definite\nmanner of knowing of the brutes and the precise limits of it in a given\nspecies, we have only indefinite conceptions, and make conjectures. Hence\nour understanding with them is also often difficult, and is only brought\nabout by skill, in consequence of experience and practice. Here then lie\ndistinctions of consciousness. On the other hand, a longing, desiring,\nwishing, or a detesting, shunning, and not wishing, is proper to every\nconsciousness: man has it in common with the polyp. This is accordingly\nthe essential element in and the basis of every consciousness. The\ndifference of the manifestations of this in the different species of\nanimal beings depends upon the various extension of their sphere of\nknowledge, in which the motives of those manifestations lie. We understand\ndirectly from our own nature all actions and behaviour of the brutes which\nexpress movements of the will; therefore, so far, we sympathise with them\nin various ways. On the other hand, the gulf between us and them results\nsimply and solely from the difference of intellect. The gulf which lies\nbetween a very sagacious brute and a man of very limited capacity is\nperhaps not much greater than that which exists between a blockhead and a\nman of genius; therefore here also the resemblance between them in another\naspect, which springs from the likeness of their inclinations and\nemotions, and assimilates them again to each other, sometimes appears with\nsurprising prominence, and excites astonishment. This consideration makes\nit clear that in all animal natures the _will_ is what is primary and\nsubstantial, the _intellect_ again is secondary, adventitious, indeed a\nmere tool for the service of the former, and is more or less complete and\ncomplicated, according to the demands of this service. As a species of\nanimals is furnished with hoofs, claws, hands, wings, horns, or teeth\naccording to the aims of its will, so also is it furnished with a more or\nless developed brain, whose function is the intelligence necessary for its\nendurance. The more complicated the organisation becomes, in the ascending\nseries of animals, the more numerous also are its wants, and the more\nvaried and specially determined the objects which are capable of\nsatisfying them; hence the more complicated and distant the paths by which\nthese are to be obtained, which must now be all known and found: therefore\nin the same proportion the ideas of the animal must be more versatile,\naccurate, definite, and connected, and also its attention must be more\nhighly strung, more sustained, and more easily roused, consequently its\nintellect must be more developed and perfect. Accordingly we see the organ\nof intelligence, the cerebral system, together with all the organs of\nsense, keep pace with the increasing wants and the complication of the\norganism; and the increase of the part of consciousness that has to do\nwith ideas (as opposed to the willing part) exhibits itself in a bodily\nform in the ever-increasing proportion of the brain in general to the rest\nof the nervous system, and of the cerebrum to the cerebellum; for\n(according to Flourens) the former is the workshop of ideas, while the\nlatter is the disposer and orderer of movements. The last step which\nnature has taken in this respect is, however, disproportionately great.\nFor in man not only does the faculty of ideas of _perception_, which alone\nexisted hitherto, reach the highest degree of perfection, but the\n_abstract_ idea, thought, _i.e._, _reason_, and with it reflection, is\nadded. Through this important advance of the intellect, thus of the\nsecondary part of consciousness, it now gains a preponderance over the\nprimary part, in so far as it becomes henceforward the predominantly\nactive part. While in the brute the immediate sense of its satisfied or\nunsatisfied desire constitutes by far the most important part of its\nconsciousness, and the more so indeed the lower the grade of the animal,\nso that the lowest animals are only distinguished from plants by the\naddition of a dull idea, in man the opposite is the case. Vehement as are\nhis desires, even more vehement than those of any brute, rising to the\nlevel of passions, yet his consciousness remains continuously and\npredominantly occupied and filled with ideas and thoughts. Without doubt\nthis has been the principal occasion of that fundamental error of all\nphilosophers on account of which they make thought that which is essential\nand primary in the so-called soul, _i.e._, in the inner or spiritual life\nof man, always placing it first, but will, as a mere product of thought,\nthey regard as only a subordinate addition and consequence of it. But if\nwilling merely proceeded from knowing, how could the brutes, even the\nlower grades of them, with so very little knowledge, often show such an\nunconquerable and vehement will? Accordingly, since that fundamental error\nof the philosophers makes, as it were, the accident the substance, it\nleads them into mistaken paths, which there is afterwards no way of\ngetting out of. Now this relative predominance of the _knowing_\nconsciousness over the _desiring_, consequently of the secondary part over\nthe primary, which appears in man, may, in particular exceptionally\nfavoured individuals, go so far that at the moments of its highest\nascendancy, the secondary or knowing part of consciousness detaches itself\naltogether from the willing part, and passes into free activity for\nitself, _i.e._, untouched by the will, and consequently no longer serving\nit. Thus it becomes purely objective, and the clear mirror of the world,\nand from it the conceptions of genius then arise, which are the subject of\nour third book.\n\n3. If we run through the series of grades of animals downwards, we see the\nintellect always becoming weaker and less perfect, but we by no means\nobserve a corresponding degradation of the will. Rather it retains\neverywhere its identical nature and shows itself in the form of great\nattachment to life, care for the individual and the species, egoism and\nregardlessness of all others, together with the emotions that spring from\nthese. Even in the smallest insect the will is present, complete and\nentire; it wills what it wills as decidedly and completely as the man. The\ndifference lies merely in _what_ it wills, _i.e._, in the motives, which,\nhowever, are the affair of the intellect. It indeed, as the secondary part\nof consciousness, and bound to the bodily organism, has innumerable\ndegrees of completeness, and is in general essentially limited and\nimperfect. The _will_, on the contrary, as original and the thing in\nitself, can never be imperfect, but every act of will is all that it can\nbe. On account of the simplicity which belongs to the will as the thing in\nitself, the metaphysical in the phenomenon, its nature admits of no\ndegrees, but is always completely itself. Only its _excitement_ has\ndegrees, from the weakest inclination to the passion, and also its\nsusceptibility to excitement, thus its vehemence from the phlegmatic to\nthe choleric temperament. The _intellect_, on the other hand, has not\nmerely degrees of _excitement_, from sleepiness to being in the vein, and\ninspiration, but also degrees of its nature, of the completeness of this,\nwhich accordingly rises gradually from the lowest animals, which can only\nobscurely apprehend, up to man, and here again from the fool to the\ngenius. The _will_ alone is everywhere completely itself. For its function\nis of the utmost simplicity; it consists in willing and not willing, which\ngoes on with the greatest ease, without effort, and requires no practice.\nKnowing, on the contrary, has multifarious functions, and never takes\nplace entirely without effort, which is required to fix the attention and\nto make clear the object, and at a higher stage is certainly needed for\nthinking and deliberation; therefore it is also capable of great\nimprovement through exercise and education. If the intellect presents a\nsimple, perceptible object to the will, the latter expresses at once its\napproval or disapproval of it, and this even if the intellect has\nlaboriously inquired and pondered, in order from numerous data, by means\nof difficult combinations, ultimately to arrive at the conclusion as to\nwhich of the two seems to be most in conformity with the interests of the\nwill. The latter has meanwhile been idly resting, and when the conclusion\nis arrived at it enters, as the Sultan enters the Divan, merely to express\nagain its monotonous approval or disapproval, which certainly may vary in\ndegree, but in its nature remains always the same.\n\nThis fundamentally different nature of the will and the intellect, the\nessential simplicity and originality of the former, in contrast to the\ncomplicated and secondary character of the latter, becomes still more\nclear to us if we observe their remarkable interaction within us, and now\nconsider in the particular case, how the images and thoughts which arise\nin the intellect move the will, and how entirely separated and different\nare the parts which the two play. We can indeed perceive this even in\nactual events which excite the will in a lively manner, while primarily\nand in themselves they are merely objects of the intellect. But, on the\none hand, it is here not so evident that this reality primarily existed\nonly in the intellect; and, on the other hand, the change does not\ngenerally take place so rapidly as is necessary if the thing is to be\neasily surveyed, and thereby become thoroughly comprehensible. Both of\nthese conditions, however, are fulfilled if it is merely thoughts and\nphantasies which we allow to act on the will. If, for example, alone with\nourselves, we think over our personal circumstances, and now perhaps\nvividly present to ourselves the menace of an actually present danger and\nthe possibility of an unfortunate issue, anxiety at once compresses the\nheart, and the blood ceases to circulate in the veins. But if then the\nintellect passes to the possibility of an opposite issue, and lets the\nimagination picture the long hoped for happiness thereby attained, all the\npulses quicken at once with joy and the heart feels light as a feather,\ntill the intellect awakes from its dream. Thereupon, suppose that an\noccasion should lead the memory to an insult or injury once suffered long\nago, at once anger and bitterness pour into the breast that was but now at\npeace. But then arises, called up by accident, the image of a long-lost\nlove, with which the whole romance and its magic scenes is connected; then\nthat anger will at once give place to profound longing and sadness.\nFinally, if there occurs to us some former humiliating incident, we shrink\ntogether, would like to sink out of sight, blush with shame, and often try\nforcibly to distract and divert our thoughts by some loud exclamation, as\nif to scare some evil spirit. One sees, the intellect plays, and the will\nmust dance to it. Indeed the intellect makes the will play the part of a\nchild which is alternately thrown at pleasure into joyful or sad moods by\nthe chatter and tales of its nurse. This depends upon the fact that the\nwill is itself without knowledge, and the understanding which is given to\nit is without will. Therefore the former is like a body which is moved,\nthe latter like the causes which set it in motion, for it is the medium of\nmotives. Yet in all this the primacy of the will becomes clear again, if\nthis will, which, as we have shown, becomes the sport of the intellect as\nsoon as it allows the latter to control it, once makes its supremacy in\nthe last instance felt by prohibiting the intellect from entertaining\ncertain ideas, absolutely preventing certain trains of thought from\narising, because it knows, _i.e._, learns from that very intellect, that\nthey would awaken in it some one of the emotions set forth above. It now\nbridles the intellect, and compels it to turn to other things. Hard as\nthis often may be, it must yet be accomplished as soon as the will is in\nearnest about it, for the resistance in this case does not proceed from\nthe intellect, which always remains indifferent, but from the will itself,\nwhich in one respect has an inclination towards an idea that in another\nrespect it abhors. It is in itself interesting to the will simply because\nit excites it, but at the same time abstract knowledge tells it that this\nidea will aimlessly cause it a shock of painful or unworthy emotion: it\nnow decides in conformity with this abstract knowledge, and compels the\nobedience of the intellect. This is called “being master of oneself.”\nClearly the master here is the will, the servant the intellect, for in the\nlast instance the will always keeps the upper hand, and therefore\nconstitutes the true core, the inner being of man. In this respect the\ntitle Ηγεμονικον would belong to the _will_; yet it seems, on the other\nhand, to apply to the _intellect_, because it is the leader and guide,\nlike the _valet de place_ who conducts a stranger. In truth, however, the\nhappiest figure of the relation of the two is the strong blind man who\ncarries on his shoulders the lame man who can see.\n\nThe relation of the will to the intellect here explained may also be\nfurther recognised in the fact that the intellect is originally entirely a\nstranger to the purposes of the will. It supplies the motives to the will,\nbut it only learns afterwards, completely _a posteriori_, how they have\naffected it, as one who makes a chemical experiment applies the reagents\nand awaits the result. Indeed the intellect remains so completely excluded\nfrom the real decisions and secret purposes of its own will that sometimes\nit can only learn them like those of a stranger, by spying upon them and\nsurprising them, and must catch the will in the act of expressing itself\nin order to get at its real intentions. For example, I have conceived a\nplan, about which, however, I have still some scruple, but the\nfeasibleness of which, as regards its possibility, is completely\nuncertain, for it depends upon external and still undecided circumstances.\nIt would therefore certainly be unnecessary to come to a decision about it\nat present, and so for the time I leave the matter as it is. Now in such a\ncase I often do not know how firmly I am already attached to that plan in\nsecret, and how much, in spite of the scruple, I wish to carry it out:\nthat is, my intellect does not know. But now only let me receive news that\nit is practicable, at once there rises within me a jubilant, irresistible\ngladness, that passes through my whole being and takes permanent\npossession of it, to my own astonishment. For now my intellect learns for\nthe first time how firmly my will had laid hold of that plan, and how\nthoroughly the plan suited it, while the intellect had regarded it as\nentirely problematical, and had with difficulty been able to overcome that\nscruple. Or in another case, I have entered eagerly into a contract which\nI believed to be very much in accordance with my wishes. But as the matter\nprogresses the disadvantages and burdens of it are felt, and I begin to\nsuspect that I even repent of what I so eagerly pursued; yet I rid myself\nof this feeling by assuring myself that even if I were not bound I would\nfollow the same course. Now, however, the contract is unexpectedly broken\nby the other side, and I perceive with astonishment that this happens to\nmy great satisfaction and relief. Often we don’t know what we wish or what\nwe fear. We may entertain a wish for years without even confessing it to\nourselves, or even allowing it to come to clear consciousness; for the\nintellect must know nothing about it, because the good opinion which we\nhave of ourselves might thereby suffer. But if it is fulfilled we learn\nfrom our joy, not without shame, that we have wished this. For example,\nthe death of a near relation whose heir we are. And sometimes we do not\nknow what we really fear, because we lack the courage to bring it to\ndistinct consciousness. Indeed we are often in error as to the real motive\nfrom which we have done something or left it undone, till at last perhaps\nan accident discovers to us the secret, and we know that what we have held\nto be the motive was not the true one, but another which we had not wished\nto confess to ourselves, because it by no means accorded with the good\nopinion we entertained of ourselves. For example, we refrain from doing\nsomething on purely moral grounds, as we believe, but afterwards we\ndiscover that we were only restrained by fear, for as soon as all danger\nis removed we do it. In particular cases this may go so far that a man\ndoes not even guess the true motive of his action, nay, does not believe\nhimself capable of being influenced by such a motive; and yet it is the\ntrue motive of his action. We may remark in passing that in all this we\nhave a confirmation and explanation of the rule of Larochefoucauld:\n“_L’amour-propre est plus habile que le plus habile homme du monde;_” nay,\neven a commentary on the Delphic γνωθι σαυτον and its difficulty. If now,\non the contrary, as all philosophers imagine, the intellect constituted\nour true nature and the purposes of the will were a mere result of\nknowledge, then only the motive from which we imagined that we acted would\nbe decisive of our moral worth; in analogy with the fact that the\nintention, not the result, is in this respect decisive. But really then\nthe distinction between imagined and true motive would be impossible. Thus\nall cases here set forth, to which every one who pays attention may\nobserve analogous cases in himself, show us how the intellect is so\nstrange to the will that it is sometimes even mystified by it: for it\nindeed supplies it with motives, but does not penetrate into the secret\nworkshop of its purposes. It is indeed a confidant of the will, but a\nconfidant that is not told everything. This is also further confirmed by\nthe fact, which almost every one will some time have the opportunity of\nobserving in himself, that sometimes the intellect does not thoroughly\ntrust the will. If we have formed some great and bold purpose, which as\nsuch is yet really only a promise made by the will to the intellect, there\noften remains within us a slight unconfessed doubt whether we are quite in\nearnest about it, whether in carrying it out we will not waver or draw\nback, but will have sufficient firmness and persistency to fulfil it. It\ntherefore requires the deed to convince us ourselves of the sincerity of\nthe purpose.\n\nAll these facts prove the absolute difference of the will and the\nintellect, the primacy of the former and the subordinate position of the\nlatter.\n\n4. The _intellect_ becomes tired; the _will_ is never tired. After\nsustained work with the head we feel the tiredness of the brain, just like\nthat of the arm after sustained bodily work. All _knowing_ is accompanied\nwith effort; _willing_, on the contrary, is our very nature, whose\nmanifestations take place without any weariness and entirely of their own\naccord. Therefore, if our will is strongly excited, as in all emotions,\nthus in anger, fear, desire, grief, &c., and we are now called upon to\nknow, perhaps with the view of correcting the motives of that emotion, the\nviolence which we must do ourselves for this purpose is evidence of the\ntransition from the original natural activity proper to ourselves to the\nderived, indirect, and forced activity. For the will alone is αυτοματος,\nand therefore ακαματος και αγηρατος ηματα παντα (_lassitudinis et senii\nexpers in sempiternum_). It alone is active without being called upon, and\ntherefore often too early and too much, and it knows no weariness. Infants\nwho scarcely show the first weak trace of intelligence are already full of\nself-will: through unlimited, aimless roaring and shrieking they show the\npressure of will with which they swell, while their willing has yet no\nobject, _i.e._, they will without knowing what they will. What Cabanis has\nobserved is also in point here: “_Toutes ces passions, qui se succèdent\nd’une mannière si rapide, et se peignent avec tant de naïveté, sur le\nvisage mobile des enfants. Tandis que les faibles muscles de leurs bras et\nde leurs jambes savent encore a peine former quelque mouvemens indécis,\nles muscles de la face expriment déjà par des mouvemens distincts presque\ntoute la suite des affections générales propres a __ la nature humaine: et\nl’observateur attentif reconnait facilement dans ce tableau les traits\ncaractéristiques de l’homme futur_” (_Rapports du Physique et Moral_, vol.\ni. p. 123). The intellect, on the contrary, develops slowly, following the\ncompletion of the brain and the maturity of the whole organism, which are\nits conditions, just because it is merely a somatic function. It is\nbecause the brain attains its full size in the seventh year that from that\ntime forward children become so remarkably intelligent, inquisitive, and\nreasonable. But then comes puberty; to a certain extent it affords a\nsupport to the brain, or a resounding-board, and raises the intellect at\nonce by a large step, as it were by an octave, corresponding to the\nlowering of the voice by that amount. But at once the animal desires and\npassions that now appear resist the reasonableness that has hitherto\nprevailed and to which they have been added. Further evidence is given of\nthe indefatigable nature of the will by the fault which is, more or less,\npeculiar to all men by nature, and is only overcome by\neducation—_precipitation_. It consists in this, that the will hurries to\nits work before the time. This work is the purely active and executive\npart, which ought only to begin when the explorative and deliberative\npart, thus the work of knowing, has been completely and thoroughly carried\nout. But this time is seldom waited for. Scarcely are a few data\nconcerning the circumstances before us, or the event that has occurred, or\nthe opinion of others conveyed to us, superficially comprehended and\nhastily gathered together by knowledge, than from the depths of our being\nthe will, always ready and never weary, comes forth unasked, and shows\nitself as terror, fear, hope, joy, desire, envy, grief, zeal, anger, or\ncourage, and leads to rash words and deeds, which are generally followed\nby repentance when time has taught us that the hegemonicon, the intellect,\nhas not been able to finish half its work of comprehending the\ncircumstances, reflecting on their connection, and deciding what is\nprudent, because the will did not wait for it, but sprang forward long\nbefore its time with “Now it is my turn!” and at once began the active\nwork, without the intellect being able to resist, as it is a mere slave\nand bondman of the will, and not, like it, αυτοματος, nor active from its\nown power and its own impulse; therefore it is easily pushed aside and\nsilenced by a nod of the will, while on its part it is scarcely able, with\nthe greatest efforts, to bring the will even to a brief pause, in order to\nspeak. This is why the people are so rare, and are found almost only among\nSpaniards, Turks, and perhaps Englishmen, who even under circumstances of\nprovocation _keep the head uppermost_, imperturbably proceed to comprehend\nand investigate the state of affairs, and when others would already be\nbeside themselves, _con mucho sosiego_, still ask further questions, which\nis something quite different from the indifference founded upon apathy and\nstupidity of many Germans and Dutchmen. Iffland used to give an excellent\nrepresentation of this admirable quality, as Hetmann of the Cossacks, in\nBenjowski, when the conspirators have enticed him into their tent and hold\na rifle to his head, with the warning that they will fire it if he utters\na cry, Iffland blew into the mouth of the rifle to try whether it was\nloaded. Of ten things that annoy us, nine would not be able to do so if we\nunderstood them thoroughly in their causes, and therefore knew their\nnecessity and true nature; but we would do this much oftener if we made\nthem the object of reflection before making them the object of wrath and\nindignation. For what bridle and bit are to an unmanageable horse the\nintellect is for the will in man; by this bridle it must be controlled by\nmeans of instruction, exhortation, culture, &c., for in itself it is as\nwild and impetuous an impulse as the force that appears in the descending\nwaterfall, nay, as we know, it is at bottom identical with this. In the\nheight of anger, in intoxication, in despair, it has taken the bit between\nits teeth, has run away, and follows its original nature. In the _Mania __\nsine delirio_ it has lost bridle and bit altogether, and shows now most\ndistinctly its original nature, and that the intellect is as different\nfrom it as the bridle from the horse. In this condition it may also be\ncompared to a clock which, when a certain screw is taken away, runs down\nwithout stopping.\n\nThus this consideration also shows us the will as that which is original,\nand therefore metaphysical; the intellect, on the other hand, as something\nsubordinate and physical. For as such the latter is, like everything\nphysical, subject to _vis inertiæ_, consequently only active if it is set\nagoing by something else, the will, which rules it, manages it, rouses it\nto effort, in short, imparts to it the activity which does not originally\nreside in it. Therefore it willingly rests whenever it is permitted to do\nso, often declares itself lazy and disinclined to activity; through\ncontinued effort it becomes weary to the point of complete stupefaction,\nis exhausted, like the voltaic pile, through repeated shocks. Hence all\ncontinuous mental work demands pauses and rest, otherwise stupidity and\nincapacity ensue, at first of course only temporarily; but if this rest is\npersistently denied to the intellect it will become excessively and\ncontinuously fatigued, and the consequence is a permanent deterioration of\nit, which in an old man may pass into complete incapacity, into\nchildishness, imbecility, and madness. It is not to be attributed to age\nin and for itself, but to long-continued tyrannical over-exertion of the\nintellect or brain, if this misfortune appears in the last years of life.\nThis is the explanation of the fact that Swift became mad, Kant became\nchildish, Walter Scott, and also Wordsworth, Southey, and many _minorum\ngentium_, became dull and incapable. Goethe remained to the end clear,\nstrong, and active-minded, because he, who was always a man of the world\nand a courtier, never carried on his mental occupations with\nself-compulsion. The same holds good of Wieland and of Kuebel, who lived\nto the age of ninety-one, and also of Voltaire. Now all this proves how\nvery subordinate and physical and what a mere tool the intellect is. Just\non this account it requires, during almost a third part of its lifetime,\nthe entire suspension of its activity in sleep, _i.e._, the rest of the\nbrain, of which it is the mere function, and which therefore just as truly\nprecedes it as the stomach precedes digestion, or as a body precedes its\nimpulsion, and with which in old age it flags and decays. The will, on the\ncontrary, as the thing in itself, is never lazy, is absolutely untiring,\nits activity is its essence, it never ceases willing, and when, during\ndeep sleep, it is forsaken of the intellect, and therefore cannot act\noutwardly in accordance with motives, it is active as the vital force,\ncares the more uninterruptedly for the inner economy of the organism, and\nas _vis naturæ medicatrix_ sets in order again the irregularities that\nhave crept into it. For it is not, like the intellect, a function of the\nbody; _but the body is its function_; therefore it is, _ordine rerum_,\nprior to the body, as its metaphysical substratum, as the in-itself of its\nphenomenal appearance. It shares its unwearying nature, for the time that\nlife lasts, with the heart, that _primum mobile_ of the organism, which\nhas therefore become its symbol and synonym. Moreover, it does not\ndisappear in the old man, but still continues to will what it has willed,\nand indeed becomes firmer, more inflexible, than it was in youth, more\nimplacable, self-willed, and unmanageable, because the intellect has\nbecome less susceptible: therefore in old age the man can perhaps only be\nmatched by taking advantage of the weakness of his intellect.\n\nMoreover, the prevailing _weakness_ and _imperfection_ of the intellect,\nas it is shown in the want of judgment, narrow-mindedness, perversity, and\nfolly of the great majority of men, would be quite inexplicable if the\nintellect were not subordinate, adventitious, and merely instrumental, but\nthe immediate and original nature of the so-called soul, or in general of\nthe inner man: as all philosophers have hitherto assumed it to be. For how\ncould the original nature in its immediate and peculiar function so\nconstantly err and fail? The _truly_ original in human consciousness, the\n_willing_, always goes on with perfect success; every being wills\nunceasingly, capably, and decidedly. To regard the immorality in the will\nas an imperfection of it would be a fundamentally false point of view. For\nmorality has rather a source which really lies above nature, and therefore\nits utterances are in contradiction with it. Therefore morality is in\ndirect opposition to the natural will, which in itself is completely\negoistic; indeed the pursuit of the path of morality leads to the\nabolition of the will. On this subject I refer to our fourth book and to\nmy prize essay, “_Ueber das Fundament der Moral_.”\n\n5. That the _will_ is what is real and essential in man, and the\n_intellect_ only subordinate, conditioned, and produced, is also to be\nseen in the fact that the latter can carry on its function with perfect\npurity and correctness only so long as the will is silent and pauses. On\nthe other hand, the function of the intellect is disturbed by every\nobservable excitement of the will, and its result is falsified by the\nintermixture of the latter; but the converse does not hold, that the\nintellect should in the same way be a hindrance to the will. Thus the moon\ncannot shine when the sun is in the heavens, but when the moon is in the\nheavens it does not prevent the sun from shining.\n\nA great _fright_ often deprives us of our senses to such an extent that we\nare petrified, or else do the most absurd things; for example, when fire\nhas broken out run right into the flames. _Anger_ makes us no longer know\nwhat we do, still less what we say. _Zeal_, therefore called blind, makes\nus incapable of weighing the arguments of others, or even of seeking out\nand setting in order our own. _Joy_ makes us inconsiderate, reckless, and\nfoolhardy, and _desire_ acts almost in the same way. _Fear_ prevents us\nfrom seeing and laying hold of the resources that are still present, and\noften lie close beside us. Therefore for overcoming sudden dangers, and\nalso for fighting with opponents and enemies, the most essential\nqualifications are _coolness and presence of mind_. The former consists in\nthe silence of the will so that the intellect can act; the latter in the\nundisturbed activity of the intellect under the pressure of events acting\non the will; therefore the former is the condition of the latter, and the\ntwo are nearly related; they are seldom to be found, and always only in a\nlimited degree. But they are of inestimable advantage, because they permit\nthe use of the intellect just at those times when we stand most in need of\nit, and therefore confer decided superiority. He who is without them only\nknows what he should have done or said when the opportunity has passed. It\nis very appropriately said of him who is violently moved, _i.e._, whose\nwill is so strongly excited that it destroys the purity of the function of\nthe intellect, he is _disarmed_; for the correct knowledge of the\ncircumstances and relations is our defence and weapon in the conflict with\nthings and with men. In this sense Balthazar Gracian says: “_Es la passion\nenemiga declarada de la cordura_” (Passion is the declared enemy of\nprudence). If now the intellect were not something completely different\nfrom the will, but, as has been hitherto supposed, knowing and willing had\nthe same root, and were equally original functions of an absolutely simple\nnature, then with the rousing and heightening of the will, in which the\nemotion consists, the intellect would necessarily also be heightened; but,\nas we have seen, it is rather hindered and depressed by this; whence the\nancients called emotion _animi perturbatio_. The intellect is really like\nthe reflecting surface of water, but the water itself is like the will,\nwhose disturbance therefore at once destroys the clearness of that mirror\nand the distinctness of its images. The _organism_ is the will itself, is\nembodied will, _i.e._, will objectively perceived in the brain. Therefore\nmany of its functions, such as respiration, circulation, secretion of\nbile, and muscular power, are heightened and accelerated by the\npleasurable, and in general the healthy, emotions. The _intellect_, on the\nother hand, is the mere function of the brain, which is only nourished and\nsupported by the organism as a parasite. Therefore every perturbation of\nthe _will_, and with it of the _organism_, must disturb and paralyse the\nfunction of the brain, which exists for itself and for no other wants than\nits own, which are simply rest and nourishment.\n\nBut this disturbing influence of the activity of the will upon the\nintellect can be shown, not only in the perturbations brought about by\nemotions, but also in many other, more gradual, and therefore more lasting\nfalsifications of thought by our inclinations. _Hope_ makes us regard what\nwe wish, and _fear_ what we are apprehensive of, as probable and near, and\nboth exaggerate their object. Plato (according to Ælian, V.H., 13, 28)\nvery beautifully called hope the dream of the waking. Its nature lies in\nthis, that the will, when its servant the intellect is not able to produce\nwhat it wishes, obliges it at least to picture it before it, in general to\nundertake the roll of comforter, to appease its lord with fables, as a\nnurse a child, and so to dress these out that they gain an appearance of\nlikelihood. Now in this the intellect must do violence to its own nature,\nwhich aims at the truth, for it compels it, contrary to its own laws, to\nregard as true things which are neither true nor probable, and often\nscarcely possible, only in order to appease, quiet, and send to sleep for\na while the restless and unmanageable _will_. Here we see clearly who is\nmaster and who is servant. Many may well have observed that if a matter\nwhich is of importance to them may turn out in several different ways, and\nthey have brought all of these into one disjunctive judgment which in\ntheir opinion is complete, the actual result is yet quite another, and one\nwholly unexpected by them: but perhaps they will not have considered this,\nthat this result was then almost always the one which was unfavourable to\nthem. The explanation of this is, that while their _intellect_ intended to\nsurvey the possibilities completely, the worst of all remained quite\ninvisible to it; because the _will_, as it were, covered it with its hand,\nthat is, it so mastered the intellect that it was quite incapable of\nglancing at the worst case of all, although, since it actually came to\npass, this was also the most probable case. Yet in very melancholy\ndispositions, or in those that have become prudent through experience like\nthis, the process is reversed, for here apprehension plays the part which\nwas formerly played by hope. The first appearance of danger throws them\ninto groundless anxiety. If the intellect begins to investigate the matter\nit is rejected as incompetent, nay, as a deceitful sophist, because the\nheart is to be believed, whose fears are now actually allowed to pass for\narguments as to the reality and greatness of the danger. So then the\nintellect dare make no search for good reasons on the other side, which,\nif left to itself, it would soon recognise, but is obliged at once to\npicture to them the most unfortunate issue, even if it itself can scarcely\nthink this issue possible:\n\n    “Such as we know is false, yet dread in sooth,\n    Because the worst is ever nearest truth.”\n\n    —BYRON (_Lara_, c. 1).\n\n_Love_ and _hate_ falsify our judgment entirely. In our enemies we see\nnothing but faults—in our loved ones nothing but excellences, and even\ntheir faults appear to us amiable. Our _interest_, of whatever kind it may\nbe, exercises a like secret power over our judgment; what is in conformity\nwith it at once seems to us fair, just, and reasonable; what runs contrary\nto it presents itself to us, in perfect seriousness, as unjust and\noutrageous, or injudicious and absurd. Hence so many prejudices of\nposition, profession, nationality, sect, and religion. A conceived\nhypothesis gives us lynx-eyes for all that confirms it, and makes us blind\nto all that contradicts it. What is opposed to our party, our plan, our\nwish, our hope, we often cannot comprehend and grasp at all, while it is\nclear to every one else; but what is favourable to these, on the other\nhand, strikes our eye from afar. What the heart opposes the head will not\nadmit. We firmly retain many errors all through life, and take care never\nto examine their ground, merely from a fear, of which we ourselves are\nconscious, that we might make the discovery that we had so long believed\nand so often asserted what is false. Thus then is the intellect daily\nbefooled and corrupted by the impositions of inclination. This has been\nvery beautifully expressed by Bacon of Verulam in the words: _Intellectus_\nLUMINIS SICCI _non est; sed recipit infusionem a voluntate et affectibus:\nid quod generat ad quod vult scientias: quod enim mavult homo, id potius\ncredit. Innumeris modis, iisque interdum imperceptibilibus, affectus\nintellectum imbuit et inficit_ (_Org. Nov._, i. 14). Clearly it is also\nthis that opposes all new fundamental opinions in the sciences and all\nrefutations of sanctioned errors, for one will not easily see the truth of\nthat which convicts one of incredible want of thought. It is explicable,\non this ground alone, that the truths of Goethe’s doctrine of colours,\nwhich are so clear and simple, are still denied by the physicists; and\nthus Goethe himself has had to learn what a much harder position one has\nif one promises men instruction than if one promises them amusement. Hence\nit is much more fortunate to be born a poet than a philosopher. But the\nmore obstinately an error was held by the other side, the more shameful\ndoes the conviction afterwards become. In the case of an overthrown\nsystem, as in the case of a conquered army, the most prudent is he who\nfirst runs away from it.\n\nA trifling and absurd, but striking example of that mysterious and\nimmediate power which the will exercises over the intellect, is the fact\nthat in doing accounts we make mistakes much oftener in our own favour\nthan to our disadvantage, and this without the slightest dishonest\nintention, merely from the unconscious tendency to diminish our _Debit_\nand increase our _Credit_.\n\nLastly, the fact is also in point here, that when advice is given the\nslightest aim or purpose of the adviser generally outweighs his insight,\nhowever great it may be; therefore we dare not assume that he speaks from\nthe latter when we suspect the existence of the former. How little perfect\nsincerity is to be expected even from otherwise honest persons whenever\ntheir interests are in any way concerned we can gather from the fact that\nwe so often deceive ourselves when hope bribes us, or fear befools us, or\nsuspicion torments us, or vanity flatters us, or an hypothesis blinds us,\nor a small aim which is close at hand injures a greater but more distant\none; for in this we see the direct and unconscious disadvantageous\ninfluence of the will upon knowledge. Accordingly it ought not to surprise\nus if in asking advice the will of the person asked directly dictates the\nanswer even before the question could penetrate to the forum of his\njudgment.\n\nI wish in a single word to point out here what will be fully explained in\nthe following book, that the most perfect knowledge, thus the purely\nobjective comprehension of the world, _i.e._, the comprehension of genius,\nis conditioned by a silence of the will so profound that while it lasts\neven the individuality vanishes from consciousness and the man remains _as\nthe pure subject of knowing_, which is the correlative of the _Idea_.\n\nThe disturbing influence of the will upon the intellect, which is proved\nby all these phenomena, and, on the other hand, the weakness and frailty\nof the latter, on account of which it is incapable of working rightly\nwhenever the will is in any way moved, gives us then another proof that\nthe will is the radical part of our nature, and acts with original power,\nwhile the intellect, as adventitious and in many ways conditioned, can\nonly act in a subordinate and conditional manner.\n\nThere is no direct disturbance of the will by the intellect corresponding\nto the disturbance and clouding of knowledge by the will that has been\nshown. Indeed we cannot well conceive such a thing. No one will wish to\nconstrue as such the fact that motives wrongly taken up lead the will\nastray, for this is a fault of the intellect in its own function, which is\ncommitted quite within its own province, and the influence of which upon\nthe will is entirely indirect. It would be plausible to attribute\n_irresolution_ to this, for in its case, through the conflict of the\nmotives which the intellect presents to the will, the latter is brought to\na standstill, thus is hindered. But when we consider it more closely, it\nbecomes very clear that the cause of this hindrance does not lie in the\nactivity of the _intellect_ as such, but entirely in _external objects_\nwhich are brought about by it, for in this case they stand in precisely\nsuch a relation to the will, which is here interested, that they draw it\nwith nearly equal strength in different directions. This real cause merely\nacts _through_ the intellect as the medium of motives, though certainly\nunder the assumption that it is keen enough to comprehend the objects in\ntheir manifold relations. Irresolution, as a trait of character, is just\nas much conditioned by qualities of the will as of the intellect. It is\ncertainly not peculiar to exceedingly limited minds, for their weak\nunderstanding does not allow them to discover such manifold qualities and\nrelations in things, and moreover is so little fitted for the exertion of\nreflection and pondering these, and then the probable consequences of each\nstep, that they rather decide at once according to the first impression,\nor according to some simple rule of conduct. The converse of this occurs\nin the case of persons of considerable understanding. Therefore, whenever\nsuch persons also possess a tender care for their own well-being, _i.e._,\na very sensitive egoism, which constantly desires to come off well and\nalways to be safe, this introduces a certain anxiety at every step, and\nthereby irresolution. This quality therefore indicates throughout not a\nwant of understanding but a want of courage. Yet very eminent minds survey\nthe relations and their probable developments with such rapidity and\ncertainty, that if they are only supported by some courage they thereby\nacquire that quick decision and resolution that fits them to play an\nimportant part in the affairs of the world, if time and circumstances\nafford them the opportunity.\n\nThe only decided, direct restriction and disturbance which the will can\nsuffer from the intellect as such may indeed be the quite exceptional one,\nwhich is the consequence of an abnormally preponderating development of\nthe intellect, thus of that high endowment which has been defined as\ngenius. This is decidedly a hindrance to the energy of the character, and\nconsequently to the power of action. Hence it is not the really great\nminds that make historical characters, because they are capable of\nbridling and ruling the mass of men and carrying out the affairs of the\nworld; but for this persons of much less capacity of mind are qualified\nwhen they have great firmness, decision, and persistency of will, such as\nis quite inconsistent with very high intelligence. Accordingly, where this\nvery high intelligence exists we actually have a case in which the\nintellect directly restricts the will.\n\n6. In opposition to the hindrances and restrictions which it has been\nshown the intellect suffers from the will, I wish now to show, in a few\nexamples, how, conversely, the functions of the intellect are sometimes\naided and heightened by the incitement and spur of the will; so that in\nthis also we may recognise the primary nature of the one and the secondary\nnature of the other, and it may become clear that the intellect stands to\nthe will in the relation of a tool.\n\nA motive which affects us strongly, such as a yearning desire or a\npressing need, sometimes raises the intellect to a degree of which we had\nnot previously believed it capable. Difficult circumstances, which impose\nupon us the necessity of certain achievements, develop entirely new\ntalents in us, the germs of which were hidden from us, and for which we\ndid not credit ourselves with any capacity. The understanding of the\nstupidest man becomes keen when objects are in question that closely\nconcern his wishes; he now observes, weighs, and distinguishes with the\ngreatest delicacy even the smallest circumstances that have reference to\nhis wishes or fears. This has much to do with the cunning of half-witted\npersons, which is often remarked with surprise. On this account Isaiah\nrightly says, _vexatio dat intellectum_, which is therefore also used as a\nproverb. Akin to it is the German proverb, “_Die Noth ist die Mutter der\nKünste_” (“Necessity is the mother of the arts”); when, however, the fine\narts are to be excepted, because the heart of every one of their works,\nthat is, the conception, must proceed from a perfectly will-less, and only\nthereby purely objective, perception, if they are to be genuine. Even the\nunderstanding of the brutes is increased considerably by necessity, so\nthat in cases of difficulty they accomplish things at which we are\nastonished. For example, they almost all calculate that it is safer not to\nrun away when they believe they are not seen; therefore the hare lies\nstill in the furrow of the field and lets the sportsman pass close to it;\ninsects, when they cannot escape, pretend to be dead, &c. We may obtain a\nfuller knowledge of this influence from the special history of the\nself-education of the wolf, under the spur of the great difficulty of its\nposition in civilised Europe; it is to be found in the second letter of\nLeroy’s excellent book, “_Lettres sur l’intelligence et la perfectibilité\ndes animaux_.” Immediately afterwards, in the third letter, there follows\nthe high school of the fox, which in an equally difficult position has far\nless physical strength. In its case, however, this is made up for by great\nunderstanding; yet only through the constant struggle with want on the one\nhand and danger on the other, thus under the spur of the will, does it\nattain that high degree of cunning which distinguishes it especially in\nold age. In all these enhancements of the intellect the will plays the\npart of a rider who with the spur urges the horse beyond the natural\nmeasure of its strength.\n\nIn the same way the memory is enhanced through the pressure of the will.\nEven if it is otherwise weak, it preserves perfectly what has value for\nthe ruling passion. The lover forgets no opportunity favourable to him,\nthe ambitious man forgets no circumstance that can forward his plans, the\navaricious man never forgets the loss he has suffered, the proud man never\nforgets an injury to his honour, the vain man remembers every word of\npraise and the most trifling distinction that falls to his lot. And this\nalso extends to the brutes: the horse stops at the inn where once long ago\nit was fed; dogs have an excellent memory for all occasions, times, and\nplaces that have afforded them choice morsels; and foxes for the different\nhiding-places in which they have stored their plunder.\n\nSelf-consideration affords opportunity for finer observations in this\nregard. Sometimes, through an interruption, it has entirely escaped me\nwhat I have just been thinking about, or even what news I have just heard.\nNow if the matter had in any way even the most distant personal interest,\nthe after-feeling of the impression which it made upon the _will_ has\nremained. I am still quite conscious how far it affected me agreeably or\ndisagreeably, and also of the special manner in which this happened,\nwhether, even in the slightest degree, it vexed me, or made me anxious, or\nirritated me, or depressed me, or produced the opposite of these\naffections. Thus the mere relation of the thing to my will is retained in\nthe memory after the thing itself has vanished, and this often becomes the\nclue to lead us back to the thing itself. The sight of a man sometimes\naffects us in an analogous manner, for we remember merely in general that\nwe have had something to do with him, yet without knowing where, when, or\nwhat it was, or who he is. But the sight of him still recalls pretty\naccurately the feeling which our dealings with him excited in us, whether\nit was agreeable or disagreeable, and also in what degree and in what way.\nThus our memory has preserved only the response of the will, and not that\nwhich called it forth. We might call what lies at the foundation of this\nprocess the memory of the heart; it is much more intimate than that of the\nhead. Yet at bottom the connection of the two is so far-reaching that if\nwe reflect deeply upon the matter we will arrive at the conclusion that\nmemory in general requires the support of a will as a connecting point, or\nrather as a thread upon which the memories can range themselves, and which\nholds them firmly together, or that the will is, as it were, the ground to\nwhich the individual memories cleave, and without which they could not\nlast; and that therefore in a pure intelligence, _i.e._, in a merely\nknowing and absolutely will-less being, a memory cannot well be conceived.\nAccordingly the improvement of the memory under the spur of the ruling\npassion, which has been shown above, is only the higher degree of that\nwhich takes place in all retention and recollection; for its basis and\ncondition is always the will. Thus in all this also it becomes clear how\nvery much more essential to us the will is than the intellect. The\nfollowing facts may also serve to confirm this.\n\nThe intellect often obeys the will; for example, if we wish to remember\nsomething, and after some effort succeed; so also if we wish now to ponder\nsomething carefully and deliberately, and in many such cases. Sometimes,\nagain, the intellect refuses to obey the will; for example, if we try in\nvain to fix our minds upon something, or if we call in vain upon the\nmemory for something that was intrusted to it. The anger of the will\nagainst the intellect on such occasions makes its relation to it and the\ndifference of the two very plain. Indeed the intellect, vexed by this\nanger, sometimes officiously brings what was asked of it hours afterwards,\nor even the following morning, quite unexpectedly and unseasonably. On the\nother hand, the will never really obeys the intellect; but the latter is\nonly the ministerial council of that sovereign; it presents all kinds of\nthings to the will, which then selects what is in conformity with its\nnature, though in doing so it determines itself with necessity, because\nthis nature is unchangeable and the motives now lie before it. Hence no\nsystem of ethics is possible which moulds and improves the will itself.\nFor all teaching only affects _knowledge_, and knowledge never determines\nthe will itself, _i.e._, the _fundamental character_ of willing, but only\nits application to the circumstances present. Rectified knowledge can only\nmodify conduct so far as it proves more exactly and judges more correctly\nwhat objects of the will’s choice are within its reach; so that the will\nnow measures its relation to things more correctly, sees more clearly what\nit desires, and consequently is less subject to error in its choice. But\nover the will itself, over the main tendency or fundamental maxim of it,\nthe intellect has no power. To believe that knowledge really and\nfundamentally determines the will is like believing that the lantern which\na man carries by night is the _primum mobile_ of his steps. Whoever,\ntaught by experience or the admonitions of others, knows and laments a\nfundamental fault of his character, firmly and honestly forms the\nintention to reform and give it up; but in spite of this, on the first\nopportunity, the fault receives free course. New repentance, new\nintentions, new transgressions. When this has been gone through several\ntimes he becomes conscious that he cannot improve himself, that the fault\nlies in his nature and personality, indeed is one with this. Now he will\nblame and curse his nature and personality, will have a painful feeling,\nwhich may rise to anguish of consciousness, but to change these he is not\nable. Here we see that which condemns and that which is condemned\ndistinctly separate: we see the former as a merely theoretical faculty,\npicturing and presenting the praiseworthy, and therefore desirable, course\nof life, but the other as something real and unchangeably present, going\nquite a different way in spite of the former: and then again the first\nremaining behind with impotent lamentations over the nature of the other,\nwith which, through this very distress, it again identifies itself. Will\nand intellect here separate very distinctly. But here the will shows\nitself as the stronger, the invincible, unchangeable, primitive, and at\nthe same time as the essential thing in question, for the intellect\ndeplores its errors, and finds no comfort in the correctness of the\n_knowledge_, as its own function. Thus the intellect shows itself entirely\nsecondary, as the spectator of the deeds of another, which it accompanies\nwith impotent praise and blame, and also as determinable from without,\nbecause it learns from experience, weighs and alters its precepts. Special\nillustrations of this subject will be found in the “_Parerga_,” vol. ii. §\n118 (second ed.,",

    "page_content": "thinking at different periods of our life will present a strange mixture\nof permanence and changeableness. On the one hand, the moral tendency of\nthe man in his prime and the old man is still the same as was that of the\nboy; on the other hand, much has become so strange to him that he no\nlonger knows himself, and wonders how he ever could have done or said this\nand that. In the first half of life to-day for the most part laughs at\nyesterday, indeed looks down on it with contempt; in the second half, on\nthe contrary, it more and more looks back at it with envy. But on closer\nexamination it will be found that the changeable element was the\n_intellect_, with its functions of insight and knowledge, which, daily\nappropriating new material from without, presents a constantly changing\nsystem of thought, while, besides this, it itself rises and sinks with the\ngrowth and decay of the organism. The will, on the contrary, the basis of\nthis, thus the inclinations, passions, and emotions, the character, shows\nitself as what is unalterable in consciousness. Yet we have to take\naccount of the modifications that depend upon physical capacities for\nenjoyment, and hence upon age. Thus, for example, the eagerness for\nsensuous pleasure will show itself in childhood as a love of dainties, in\nyouth and manhood as the tendency to sensuality, and in old age again as a\nlove of dainties.\n\n7. If, as is generally assumed, the will proceeded from knowledge, as its\nresult or product, then where there is much will there would necessarily\nalso be much knowledge, insight, and understanding. This, however, is\nabsolutely not the case; rather, we find in many men a strong, _i.e._,\ndecided, resolute, persistent, unbending, wayward, and vehement will,\ncombined with a very weak and incapable understanding, so that every one\nwho has to do with them is thrown into despair, for their will remains\ninaccessible to all reasons and ideas, and is not to be got at, so that it\nis hidden, as it were, in a sack, out of which it wills blindly. Brutes\nhave often violent, often stubborn wills, but yet very little\nunderstanding. Finally, plants only will without any knowledge at all.\n\nIf willing sprang merely from knowledge, our _anger_ would necessarily be\nin every case exactly proportionate to the occasion, or at least to our\nrelation to it, for it would be nothing more than the result of the\npresent knowledge. This, however, is rarely the case; rather, anger\ngenerally goes far beyond the occasion. Our fury and rage, the _furor\nbrevis_, often upon small occasions, and without error regarding them, is\nlike the raging of an evil spirit which, having been shut up, only waits\nits opportunity to dare to break loose, and now rejoices that it has found\nit. This could not be the case if the foundation of our nature were a\n_knower_, and willing were merely a result of _knowledge_; for how came\nthere into the result what did not lie in the elements? The conclusion\ncannot contain more than the premisses. Thus here also the will shows\nitself as of a nature quite different from knowledge, which only serves it\nfor communication with the external world, but then the will follows the\nlaws of its own nature without taking from the intellect anything but the\noccasion.\n\nThe intellect, as the mere tool of the will, is as different from it as\nthe hammer from the smith. So long as in a conversation the intellect\nalone is active it remains _cold_. It is almost as if the man himself were\nnot present. Moreover, he cannot then, properly speaking, compromise\nhimself, but at the most can make himself ridiculous. Only when the will\ncomes into play is the man really present: now he becomes _warm_, nay, it\noften happens, _hot_. It is always the will to which we ascribe the warmth\nof life; on the other hand, we say the _cold_ understanding, or to\ninvestigate a thing _coolly_, _i.e._, to think without being influenced by\nthe will. If we attempt to reverse the relation, and to regard the will as\nthe tool of the intellect, it is as if we made the smith the tool of the\nhammer.\n\nNothing is more provoking, when we are arguing against a man with reasons\nand explanations, and taking all pains to convince him, under the\nimpression that we have only to do with his _understanding_, than to\ndiscover at last that he _will_ not understand; that thus we had to do\nwith his _will_, which shuts itself up against the truth and brings into\nthe field wilful misunderstandings, chicaneries, and sophisms in order to\nintrench itself behind its understanding and its pretended want of\ninsight. Then he is certainly not to be got at, for reasons and proofs\napplied against the will are like the blows of a phantom produced by\nmirrors against a solid body. Hence the saying so often repeated, “_Stat\npro ratione voluntas._” Sufficient evidence of what has been said is\nafforded by ordinary life. But unfortunately proofs of it are also to be\nfound on the path of the sciences. The recognition of the most important\ntruths, of the rarest achievements, will be looked for in vain from those\nwho have an interest in preventing them from being accepted, an interest\nwhich either springs from the fact that such truths contradict what they\nthemselves daily teach, or else from this, that they dare not make use of\nthem and teach them; or if all this be not the case they will not accept\nthem, because the watchword of mediocrity will always be, _Si quelqu’un __\nexcelle parmi nous, qu’il aille exceller ailleurs_, as Helvetius has\nadmirably rendered the saying of the Ephesian in the fifth book of\nCicero’s “_Tusculanæ_” (c. 36), or as a saying of the Abyssinian Fit Arari\nputs it, “Among quartzes adamant is outlawed.” Thus whoever expects from\nthis always numerous band a just estimation of what he has done will find\nhimself very much deceived, and perhaps for a while he will not be able to\nunderstand their behaviour, till at last he finds out that while he\napplied himself to _knowledge_ he had to do with the _will_, thus is\nprecisely in the position described above, nay, is really like a man who\nbrings his case before a court the judges of which have all been bribed.\nYet in particular cases he will receive the fullest proof that their will\nand not their insight opposed him, when one or other of them makes up his\nmind to plagiarism. Then he will see with astonishment what good judges\nthey are, what correct perception of the merit of others they have, and\nhow well they know how to find out the best, like the sparrows, who never\nmiss the ripest cherries.\n\nThe counterpart of the victorious resistance of the will to knowledge here\nset forth appears if in expounding our reasons and proofs we have the will\nof those addressed with us. Then all are at once convinced, all arguments\nare telling, and the matter is at once clear as the day. This is well\nknown to popular speakers. In the one case, as in the other, the will\nshows itself as that which has original power, against which the intellect\ncan do nothing.\n\n8. But now we shall take into consideration the individual qualities, thus\nexcellences and faults of the will and character on the one hand, and of\nthe intellect on the other, in order to make clear, in their relation to\neach other, and their relative worth, the complete difference of the two\nfundamental faculties. History and experience teach that the two appear\nquite independently of each other. That the greatest excellence of mind\nwill not easily be found combined with equal excellence of character is\nsufficiently explained by the extraordinary rarity of both, while their\nopposites are everywhere the order of the day; hence we also daily find\nthe latter in union. However, we never infer a good will from a superior\nmind, nor the latter from the former, nor the opposite from the opposite,\nbut every unprejudiced person accepts them as perfectly distinct\nqualities, the presence of which each for itself has to be learned from\nexperience. Great narrowness of mind may coexist with great goodness of\nheart, and I do not believe Balthazar Gracian was right in saying\n(_Discreto_, p. 406), “_No ay simple, que no sea malicioso_” (“There is no\nsimpleton who would not be malicious”), though he has the Spanish proverb\nin his favour, “_Nunca la necedad anduvo sin malicia_” (“Stupidity is\nnever without malice”). Yet it may be that many stupid persons become\nmalicious for the same reason as many hunchbacks, from bitterness on\naccount of the neglect they have suffered from nature, and because they\nthink they can occasionally make up for what they lack in understanding\nthrough malicious cunning, seeking in this a brief triumph. From this, by\nthe way, it is also comprehensible why almost every one easily becomes\nmalicious in the presence of a very superior mind. On the other hand,\nagain, stupid people have very often the reputation of special\ngood-heartedness, which yet so seldom proves to be the case that I could\nnot help wondering how they had gained it, till I was able to flatter\nmyself that I had found the key to it in what follows. Moved by a secret\ninclination, every one likes best to choose for his more intimate\nintercourse some one to whom he is a little superior in understanding, for\nonly in this case does he find himself at his ease, because, according to\nHobbes, “_Omnis animi voluptas, omnisgue alacritas in eo sita est, quod\nquis habeat, quibuscum conferens se, possit magnifice sentire de se ipso_”\n(_De Cive_, i. 5). For the same reason every one avoids him who is\nsuperior to himself; wherefore Lichtenberg quite rightly observes: “To\ncertain men a man of mind is a more odious production than the most\npronounced rogue.” And similarly Helvetius says: “_Les gens médiocres ont\nun instinct sûr et prompt, pour connaître et fuir les gens d’esprit._” And\nDr. Johnson assures us that “there is nothing by which a man exasperates\nmost people more than by displaying a superior ability of brilliancy in\nconversation. They seem pleased at the time, but their envy makes them\ncurse him in their hearts” (Boswell; aet. anno 74). In order to bring this\ntruth, so universal and so carefully concealed, more relentlessly to\nlight, I add the expression of it by Merck, the celebrated friend of\nGoethe’s youth, from his story “_Lindor:_” “He possessed talents which\nwere given him by nature and acquired by himself through learning; and\nthus it happened that in most society he left the worthy members of it far\nbehind.” If, in the moment of delight at the sight of an extraordinary\nman, the public swallows these superiorities also, without actually at\nonce putting a bad construction upon them, yet a certain impression of\nthis phenomenon remains behind, which, if it is often repeated, may on\nserious occasions have disagreeable future consequences for him who is\nguilty of it. Without any one consciously noting that on this occasion he\nwas insulted, no one is sorry to place himself tacitly in the way of the\nadvancement of this man. Thus on this account great mental superiority\nisolates more than anything else, and makes one, at least silently, hated.\nNow it is the opposite of this that makes stupid people so generally\nliked; especially since many can only find in them what, according to the\nlaw of their nature referred to above, they must seek. Yet this the true\nreason of such an inclination no one will confess to himself, still less\nto others; and therefore, as a plausible pretext for it, will impute to\nthose he has selected a special goodness of heart, which, as we have said,\nis in reality only very rarely and accidentally found in combination with\nmental incapacity. Want of understanding is accordingly by no means\nfavourable or akin to goodness of character. But, on the other hand, it\ncannot be asserted that great understanding is so; nay, rather, no\nscoundrel has in general been without it. Indeed even the highest\nintellectual eminence can coexist with the worst moral depravity. An\nexample of this is afforded by Bacon of Verulam: “Ungrateful, filled with\nthe lust of power, wicked and base, he at last went so far that, as Lord\nChancellor and the highest judge of the realm, he frequently allowed\nhimself to be bribed in civil actions. Impeached before his peers, he\nconfessed himself guilty, was expelled by them from the House of Lords,\nand condemned to a fine of forty thousand pounds and imprisonment in the\nTower” (see the review of the latest edition of Bacon’s Works in the\n_Edinburgh Review_, August 1837). Hence also Pope called him “the wisest,\nbrightest, meanest of mankind” (“Essay on Man,” iv. 282). A similar\nexample is afforded by the historian Guicciardini, of whom Rosini says in\nthe _Notizie Storiche_, drawn from good contemporary sources, which is\ngiven in his historical romance “_Luisa Strozzi_:” “_Da coloro, che\npongono l’ingegno e il sapere al di sopra di tutte le umane qualità,\nquesto uomo sarà riguardato come fra i più grandi del suo secolo: ma da\nquelli, che reputano la virtù dovere andare innanzi a tutto, non potra\nesecrarsi abbastanza la sua memoria. Esso fu il più crudele fra i\ncittadini a perseguitare, uccidere e confinare_,” &c.(32)\n\nIf now it is said of one man, “He has a good heart, though a bad head,”\nbut of another, “He has a very good head, yet a bad heart,” every one\nfeels that in the first case the praise far outweighs the blame—in the\nother case the reverse. Answering to this, we see that if some one has\ndone a bad deed his friends and he himself try to remove the guilt from\nthe _will_ to the _intellect_, and to give out that faults of the heart\nwere faults of the head; roguish tricks they will call _errors_, will say\nthey were merely want of understanding, want of reflection,\nlight-mindedness, folly; nay, if need be, they will plead a paroxysm,\nmomentary mental aberration, and if a heavy crime is in question, even\nmadness, only in order to free the _will_ from the guilt. And in the same\nway, we ourselves, if we have caused a misfortune or injury, will before\nothers and ourselves willingly impeach our _stultitia_, simply in order to\nescape the reproach of _malitia_. In the same way, in the case of the\nequally unjust decision of the judge, the difference, whether he has erred\nor been bribed, is so infinitely great. All this sufficiently proves that\nthe _will_ alone is the real and essential, the kernel of the man, and the\n_intellect_ is merely its tool, which may be constantly faulty without the\nwill being concerned. The accusation of want of understanding is, at the\nmoral judgment-seat, no accusation at all; on the contrary, it even gives\nprivileges. And so also, before the courts of the world, it is everywhere\nsufficient to deliver a criminal from all punishment that his guilt should\nbe transferred from his will to his intellect, by proving either\nunavoidable error or mental derangement, for then it is of no more\nconsequence than if hand or foot had slipped against the will. I have\nfully discussed this in the appendix, “_Ueber die Intellektuelle\nFreiheit_,” to my prize essay on the freedom of the will, to which I refer\nto avoid repetition.\n\nEverywhere those who are responsible for any piece of work appeal, in the\nevent of its turning out unsatisfactorily, to their good intentions, of\nwhich there was no lack. Hereby they believe that they secure the\nessential, that for which they are properly answerable, and their true\nself; the inadequacy of their faculties, on the other hand, they regard as\nthe want of a suitable tool.\n\nIf a man is _stupid_, we excuse him by saying that he cannot help it; but\nif we were to excuse a _bad_ man on the same grounds we would be laughed\nat. And yet the one, like the other, is innate. This proves that the will\nis the man proper, the intellect merely its tool.\n\nThus it is always only our _willing_ that is regarded as depending upon\nourselves, _i.e._, as the expression of our true nature, and for which we\nare therefore made responsible. Therefore it is absurd and unjust if we\nare taken to task for our beliefs, thus for our knowledge: for we are\nobliged to regard this as something which, although it changes in us, is\nas little in our power as the events of the external world. And here,\nalso, it is clear that the _will_ alone is the inner and true nature of\nman; the _intellect_, on the contrary, with its operations, which go on as\nregularly as the external world, stands to the will in the relation of\nsomething external to it, a mere tool.\n\nHigh mental capacities have always been regarded as the gift of nature or\nthe gods; and on that account they have been called _Gaben_, _Begabung_,\n_ingenii dotes_, gifts (a man highly gifted), regarding them as something\ndifferent from the man himself, something that has fallen to his lot\nthrough favour. No one, on the contrary, has ever taken this view of moral\nexcellences, although they also are innate; they have rather always been\nregarded as something proceeding from the man himself, essentially\nbelonging to him, nay, constituting his very self. But it follows now from\nthis that the will is the true nature of man; the intellect, on the other\nhand, is secondary, a tool, a gift.\n\nAnswering to this, all religions promise a reward beyond life, in\neternity, for excellences of the _will_ or heart, but none for excellences\nof the head or understanding. Virtue expects its reward in that world;\nprudence hopes for it in this; genius, again, neither in this world nor in\nthat; it is its own reward. Accordingly the will is the eternal part, the\nintellect the temporal.\n\nConnection, communion, intercourse among men is based, as a rule, upon\nrelations which concern the _will_, not upon such as concern the\n_intellect_. The first kind of communion may be called the _material_, the\nother the _formal_. Of the former kind are the bonds of family and\nrelationship, and further, all connections that rest upon any common aim\nor interest, such as that of trade or profession, of the corporation, the\nparty, the faction, &c. In these it merely amounts to a question of views,\nof aims; along with which there may be the greatest diversity of\nintellectual capacity and culture. Therefore not only can any one live in\npeace and unity with any one else, but can act with him and be allied to\nhim for the common good of both. Marriage also is a bond of the heart, not\nof the head. It is different, however, with merely formal communion, which\naims only at an exchange of thought; this demands a certain equality of\nintellectual capacity and culture. Great differences in this respect place\nbetween man and man an impassable gulf: such lies, for example, between a\nman of great mind and a fool, between a scholar and a peasant, between a\ncourtier and a sailor. Natures as heterogeneous as this have therefore\ntrouble in making themselves intelligible so long as it is a question of\nexchanging thoughts, ideas, and views. Nevertheless close _material_\nfriendship may exist between them, and they may be faithful allies,\nconspirators, or men under mutual pledges. For in all that concerns the\nwill alone, which includes friendship, enmity, honesty, fidelity,\nfalseness, and treachery, they are perfectly homogeneous, formed of the\nsame clay, and neither mind nor culture make any difference here; indeed\nhere the ignorant man often shames the scholar, the sailor the courtier.\nFor at the different grades of culture there are the same virtues and\nvices, emotions and passions; and although somewhat modified in their\nexpression, they very soon mutually recognise each other even in the most\nheterogeneous individuals, upon which the similarly disposed agree and the\nopposed are at enmity.\n\nBrilliant qualities of mind win admiration, but never affection; this is\nreserved for the moral, the qualities of the character. Every one will\nchoose as his friend the honest, the good-natured, and even the agreeable,\ncomplaisant man, who easily concurs, rather than the merely able man.\nIndeed many will be preferred to the latter, on account of insignificant,\naccidental, outward qualities which just suit the inclination of another.\nOnly the man who has much mind himself will wish able men for his society;\nhis friendship, on the other hand, he will bestow with reference to moral\nqualities; for upon this depends his really high appreciation of a man in\nwhom a single good trait of character conceals and expiates great want of\nunderstanding. The known goodness of a character makes us patient and\nyielding towards weaknesses of understanding, as also towards the dulness\nand childishness of age. A distinctly noble character along with the\nentire absence of intellectual excellence and culture presents itself as\nlacking nothing; while, on the contrary, even the greatest mind, if\naffected with important moral faults, will always appear blamable. For as\ntorches and fireworks become pale and insignificant in the presence of the\nsun, so intellect, nay, genius, and also beauty, are outshone and eclipsed\nby the goodness of the heart. When this appears in a high degree it can\nmake up for the want of those qualities to such an extent that one is\nashamed of having missed them. Even the most limited understanding, and\nalso grotesque ugliness, whenever extraordinary goodness of heart declares\nitself as accompanying them, become as it were transfigured, outshone by a\nbeauty of a higher kind, for now a wisdom speaks out of them before which\nall other wisdom must be dumb. For goodness of heart is a transcendent\nquality; it belongs to an order of things that reaches beyond this life,\nand is incommensurable with any other perfection. When it is present in a\nhigh degree it makes the heart so large that it embraces the world, so\nthat now everything lies within it, no longer without; for it identifies\nall natures with its own. It then extends to others also that boundless\nindulgence which otherwise each one only bestows on himself. Such a man is\nincapable of becoming angry; even if the malicious mockery and sneers of\nothers have drawn attention to his own intellectual or physical faults, he\nonly reproaches himself in his heart for having been the occasion of such\nexpressions, and therefore, without doing violence to his own feelings,\nproceeds to treat those persons in the kindest manner, confidently hoping\nthat they will turn from their error with regard to him, and recognise\nthemselves in him also. What is wit and genius against this?—what is Bacon\nof Verulam?\n\nOur estimation of our own selves leads to the same result as we have here\nobtained by considering our estimation of others. How different is the\nself-satisfaction which we experience in a moral regard from that which we\nexperience in an intellectual regard! The former arises when, looking back\non our conduct, we see that with great sacrifices we have practised\nfidelity and honesty, that we have helped many, forgiven many, have\nbehaved better to others than they have behaved to us; so that we can say\nwith King Lear, “I am a man more sinned against than sinning;” and to its\nfullest extent if perhaps some noble deed shines in our memory. A deep\nseriousness will accompany the still peace which such a review affords us;\nand if we see that others are inferior to us here, this will not cause us\nany joy, but we will rather deplore it, and sincerely wish that they were\nas we are. How entirely differently does the knowledge of our intellectual\nsuperiority affect us! Its ground bass is really the saying of Hobbes\nquoted above: _Omnis animi voluptas, omnisque alacritas in eo sita est,\nquad quis habeat, quibuscum conferens se, possit magnifice sentire de se\nipso._ Arrogant, triumphant vanity, proud, contemptuous looking down on\nothers, inordinate delight in the consciousness of decided and\nconsiderable superiority, akin to pride of physical advantages,—that is\nthe result here. This opposition between the two kinds of\nself-satisfaction shows that the one concerns our true inner and eternal\nnature, the other a more external, merely temporal, and indeed scarcely\nmore than a mere physical excellence. The _intellect_ is in fact simply\nthe function of the brain; the _will_, on the contrary, is that whose\nfunction is the whole man, according to his being and nature.\n\nIf, looking without us, we reflect that ὁ βιος βραχυς, ἡ δε τεχνη μακρα\n(_vita brevis, ars longa_), and consider how the greatest and most\nbeautiful minds, often when they have scarcely reached the summit of their\npower, and the greatest scholars, when they have only just attained to a\nthorough knowledge of their science, are snatched away by death, we are\nconfirmed in this, that the meaning and end of life is not intellectual\nbut moral.\n\nThe complete difference between the mental and moral qualities displays\nitself lastly in the fact that the intellect suffers very important\nchanges through time, while the will and character remain untouched by it.\nThe new-born child has as yet no use of its understanding, but obtains it\nwithin the first two months to the extent of perception and apprehension\nof the things in the external world—a process which I have described more\nfully in my essay, “_Ueber das Sehn und die Farben_,” p. 10 of the second\n(and third) edition. The growth of reason to the point of speech, and\nthereby of thought, follows this first and most important step much more\nslowly, generally only in the third year; yet the early childhood remains\nhopelessly abandoned to silliness and folly, primarily because the brain\nstill lacks physical completeness, which, both as regards its size and\ntexture, it only attains in the seventh year. But then for its energetic\nactivity there is still wanting the antagonism of the genital system; it\ntherefore only begins with puberty. Through this, however, the intellect\nhas only attained to the _capacity_ for its psychical improvement; this\nitself can only be won by practice, experience, and instruction. Thus as\nsoon as the mind has escaped from the folly of childhood it falls into the\nsnares of innumerable errors, prejudices, and chimeras, sometimes of the\nabsurdest and crudest kind, which it obstinately sticks to, till\nexperience gradually removes them, and many of them also are insensibly\nlost. All this takes many years to happen, so that one grants it majority\nindeed soon after the twentieth year, yet has placed full maturity, years\nof discretion, not before the fortieth year. But while this psychical\neducation, resting upon help from without, is still in process of growth,\nthe inner _physical_ energy of the brain already begins to sink again.\nThis has reached its real culminating point about the thirtieth year, on\naccount of its dependence upon the pressure of blood and the effect of the\npulsation upon the brain, and through this again upon the predominance of\nthe arterial over the venous system, and the fresh tenderness of the brain\nfibre, and also on account of the energy of the genital system. After the\nthirty-fifth year a slight diminution of the physical energy of the brain\nbecomes noticeable, which, through the gradually approaching predominance\nof the venous over the arterial system, and also through the increasing\nfirmer and drier consistency of the brain fibre, more and more takes\nplace, and would be much more observable if it were not that, on the other\nhand, the psychical perfecting, through exercise, experience, increase of\nknowledge, and acquired skill in the use of it, counteracts it—an\nantagonism which fortunately lasts to an advanced age, for the brain\nbecomes more and more like a worn-out instrument. But yet the diminution\nof the original energy of the intellect, resting entirely upon organic\nconditions, continues, slowly indeed, but unceasingly: the faculty of\noriginal conception, the imagination, the plastic power, the memory,\nbecome noticeably weaker; and so it goes on step by step downwards into\nold age, garrulous, without memory, half-unconscious, and ultimately quite\nchildish.\n\nThe will, on the contrary, is not affected by all this becoming, this\nchange and vicissitude, but is from beginning to end unalterably the same.\n_Willing_ does not require to be learned like _knowing_, but succeeds\nperfectly at once. The new-born child makes violent movements, rages, and\ncries; it wills in the most vehement manner, though it does not yet know\nwhat it wills. For the medium of motives, the intellect, is not yet fully\ndeveloped. The will is in darkness concerning the external world, in which\nits objects lie, and now rages like a prisoner against the walls and bars\nof his dungeon. But little by little it becomes light: at once the\nfundamental traits of universal human willing, and, at the same time, the\nindividual modification of it here present, announce themselves. The\nalready appearing character shows itself indeed at first in weak and\nuncertain outline, on account of the defective service of the intellect,\nwhich has to present it with motives; but to the attentive observer it\nsoon declares its complete presence, and in a short time it becomes\nunmistakable. The characteristics appear which last through the whole of\nlife; the principal tendencies of the will, the easily excited emotions,\nthe ruling passion, declare themselves. Therefore the events at school\nstand to those of the future life for the most part as the dumb-show in\n“Hamlet” that precedes the play to be given at the court, and foretells\nits content in the form of pantomime, stands to the play itself. But it is\nby no means possible to prognosticate in the same way the future\nintellectual capacities of the man from those shown in the boy; rather as\na rule the _ingenia præcocia_, prodigies, turn out block-heads; genius, on\nthe contrary, is often in childhood of slow conception, and comprehends\nwith difficulty, just because it comprehends deeply. This is how it is\nthat every one relates laughing and without reserve the follies and\nstupidities of his childhood. For example, Goethe, how he threw all the\nkitchen crockery out of the window (_Dichtung und Wahrheit_, vol. i. p.\n7); for we know that all this only concerns what changes. On the other\nhand, a prudent man will not favour us with the bad features, the\nmalicious or deceitful actions, of his youth, for he feels that they also\nbear witness to his present character. I have been told that when Gall,\nthe phrenologist and investigator of man, had to put himself into\nconnection with a man as yet unknown to him, he used to get him to speak\nabout his youthful years and actions, in order, if possible, to gather\nfrom these the distinctive traits of his character; because this must\nstill be the same now. This is the reason why we are indifferent to the\nfollies and want of understanding of our youthful years, and even look\nback on them with smiling satisfaction, while the bad features of\ncharacter even of that time, the ill-natured actions and the misdeeds then\ncommitted exist even in old age as inextinguishable reproaches, and\ntrouble our consciences. Now, just as the character appears complete, so\nit remains unaltered to old age. The advance of age, which gradually\nconsumes the intellectual powers, leaves the moral qualities untouched.\nThe goodness of the heart still makes the old man honoured and loved when\nhis head already shows the weaknesses which are the commencement of second\nchildhood. Gentleness, patience, honesty, veracity, disinterestedness,\nphilanthropy, &c., remain through the whole life, and are not lost through\nthe weaknesses of old age; in every clear moment of the worn-out old man\nthey come forth undiminished, like the sun from the winter clouds. And, on\nthe other hand, malice, spite, avarice, hard-heartedness, infidelity,\negoism, and baseness of every kind also remain undiminished to our latest\nyears. We would not believe but would laugh at any one who said to us, “In\nformer years I was a malicious rogue, but now I am an honest and\nnoble-minded man.” Therefore Sir Walter Scott, in the “Fortunes of Nigel,”\nhas shown very beautifully, in the case of the old usurer, how burning\navarice, egoism, and injustice are still in their full strength, like a\npoisonous plant in autumn, when the intellect has already become childish.\nThe only alterations that take place in our inclinations are those which\nresult directly from the decrease of our physical strength, and with it of\nour capacities for enjoyment. Thus voluptuousness will make way for\nintemperance, the love of splendour for avarice, and vanity for ambition;\njust like the man who before he has a beard will wear a false one, and\nlater, when his own beard has become grey, will dye it brown. Thus while\nall organic forces, muscular power, the senses, the memory, wit,\nunderstanding, genius, wear themselves out, and in old age become dull,\nthe will alone remains undecayed and unaltered: the strength and the\ntendency of willing remains the same. Indeed in many points the will shows\nitself still more decided in age: thus, in the clinging to life, which, it\nis well known, increases; also in the firmness and persistency with regard\nto what it has once embraced, in obstinacy; which is explicable from the\nfact that the susceptibility of the intellect for other impressions, and\nthereby the movement of the will by motives streaming in upon it, has\ndiminished. Hence the implacable nature of the anger and hate of old\npersons—\n\n    “The young man’s wrath is like light straw on fire,\n    But like red-hot steel is the old man’s ire.”\n\n    —_Old Ballad._\n\nFrom all these considerations it becomes unmistakable to the more\npenetrating glance that, while the _intellect_ has to run through a long\nseries of gradual developments, but then, like everything physical, must\nencounter decay, the _will_ takes no part in this, except so far as it has\nto contend at first with the imperfection of its tool, the intellect, and,\nagain, at last with its worn-out condition, but itself appears perfect and\nremains unchanged, not subject to the laws of time and of becoming and\npassing away in it. Thus in this way it makes itself known as that which\nis metaphysical, not itself belonging to the phenomenal world.\n\n9. The universally used and generally very well understood expressions\n_heart_ and _head_ have sprung from a true feeling of the fundamental\ndistinction here in question; therefore they are also apt and significant,\nand occur in all languages. _Nec cor nec caput habet_, says Seneca of the\nEmperor Claudius (_Ludus de morte Claudii Cæsaris_, c. 8). The heart, this\n_primum mobile_ of the animal life, has with perfect justice been chosen\nas the symbol, nay, the synonym, of the _will_, as the primary kernel of\nour phenomenon, and denotes this in opposition to the intellect, which is\nexactly identical with the head. All that, in the widest sense, is matter\nof the will, as wish, passion, joy, grief, goodness, wickedness, also what\nwe are wont to understand under “Gemüth,” and what Homer expresses through\nφιλον ἠτορ, is attributed to the _heart_. Accordingly we say: He has a bad\nheart;—his heart is in the thing;—it comes from his heart;—it cut him to\nthe heart;—it breaks his heart;—his heart bleeds;—the heart leaps for\njoy;—who can see the heart of man?—it is heart-rending, heart-crushing,\nheart-breaking, heart-inspiring, heart-touching;—he is good-hearted,\nhard-hearted, heartless, stout-hearted, faint-hearted, &c. &c. Quite\nspecially, however, love affairs are called affairs of the heart,\n_affaires de cœur_; because the sexual impulse is the focus of the will,\nand the selection with reference to it constitutes the chief concern of\nnatural, human volition, the ground of which I shall show in a full\nchapter supplementary to the fourth book. Byron in “Don Juan,” c. xi. v.\n34, is satirical about love being to women an affair of the head instead\nof an affair of the heart. On the other hand, the _head_ denotes\neverything that is matter of _knowledge_. Hence a man of head, a good\nhead, a fine head, a bad head, to lose one’s head, to keep one’s head\nuppermost, &c. Heart and head signifies the whole man. But the head is\nalways the second, the derived; for it is not the centre but the highest\nefflorescence of the body. When a hero dies his heart is embalmed, not his\nbrain; on the other hand, we like to preserve the skull of the poet, the\nartist, and the philosopher. So Raphael’s skull was preserved in the\nAcademia di S. Luca at Rome, though it has lately been proved not to be\ngenuine; in Stockholm in 1820 the skull of Descartes was sold by\nauction.(33)\n\nA true feeling of the real relation between will, intellect, and life is\nalso expressed in the Latin language. The intellect is _mens_, νους; the\nwill again is _animus_, which comes from _anima_, and this from ανεμων.\n_Anima_ is the life itself, the breath, ψυχη; but _animus_ is the living\nprinciple, and also the will, the subject of inclinations, intentions,\npassions, emotions; hence also _est mihi animus_,—_fert animus_,—for “I\nhave a desire to,” also _animi causa_, &c.; it is the Greek θυμος, the\nGerman “Gemüth,” thus the heart but not the head. _Animi perturbatio_ is\nan emotion; _mentis perturbatio_ would signify insanity. The predicate\n_immortalis_ is attributed to _animus_, not to _mens_. All this is the\nrule gathered from the great majority of passages; though in the case of\nconceptions so nearly related it cannot but be that the words are\nsometimes interchanged. Under ψυχη the Greeks appear primarily and\noriginally to have understood the vital force, the living principle,\nwhereby at once arose the dim sense that it must be something\nmetaphysical, which consequently would not be reached by death. Among\nother proofs of this are the investigations of the relation between νους\nand ψυχη preserved by Stobæus (_Ecl._, Lib. i. c. 51, § 7, 8).\n\n10. Upon what depends the _identity of the person_? Not upon the matter of\nthe body; it is different after a few years. Not upon its form, which\nchanges as a whole and in all its parts; all but the expression of the\nglance, by which, therefore, we still know a man even after many years;\nwhich proves that in spite of all changes time produces in him something\nin him remains quite untouched by it. It is just this by which we\nrecognise him even after the longest intervals of time, and find the\nformer man entire. It is the same with ourselves, for, however old we\nbecome, we yet feel within that we are entirely the same as we were when\nwe were young, nay, when we were still children. This, which unaltered\nalways remains quite the same, and does not grow old along with us, is\nreally the kernel of our nature, which does not lie in time. It is assumed\nthat the identity of the person rests upon that of consciousness. But by\nthis is understood merely the connected recollection of the course of\nlife; hence it is not sufficient. We certainly know something more of our\nlife than of a novel we have formerly read, yet only very little. The\nprincipal events, the interesting scenes, have impressed themselves upon\nus; in the remainder a thousand events are forgotten for one that has been\nretained. The older we become the more do things pass by us without\nleaving any trace. Great age, illness, injury of the brain, madness, may\ndeprive us of memory altogether, but the identity of the person is not\nthereby lost. It rests upon the identical _will_ and the unalterable\ncharacter of the person. It is it also which makes the expression of the\nglance unchangeable. In the _heart_ is the man, not in the head. It is\ntrue that, in consequence of our relation to the external world, we are\naccustomed to regard as our real self the subject of knowledge, the\nknowing I, which wearies in the evening, vanishes in sleep, and in the\nmorning shines brighter with renewed strength. This is, however, the mere\nfunction of the brain, and not our own self. Our true self, the kernel of\nour nature, is what is behind that, and really knows nothing but willing\nand not willing, being content and not content, with all the modifications\nof this, which are called feelings, emotions, and passions. This is that\nwhich produces the other, does not sleep with it when it sleeps, and in\nthe same way when it sinks in death remains uninjured. Everything, on the\ncontrary, that belongs to _knowledge_ is exposed to oblivion; even actions\nof moral significance can sometimes, after years, be only imperfectly\nrecalled, and we no longer know accurately and in detail how we acted on a\ncritical occasion. But the _character itself_, to which the actions only\ntestify, cannot be forgotten by us; it is now still quite the same as\nthen. The will itself, alone and for itself, is permanent, for it alone is\nunchangeable, indestructible, not growing old, not physical, but\nmetaphysical, not belonging to the phenomenal appearance, but to that\nitself which so appears. How the identity of consciousness also, so far as\nit goes, depends upon it I have shown above in chapter 15, so I need not\ndwell upon it further here.\n\n11. Aristotle says in passing, in his book on the comparison of the\ndesirable, “To live well is better than to live” (βελτιον του ζῃν το ευ\nζῃν, Top. iii. 2). From this we might infer, by double contraposition, not\nto live is better than to live badly. This is also evident to the\nintellect; yet the great majority live very badly rather than not at all.\nThis clinging to life cannot therefore have its ground in the _object_ of\nlife, since life, as was shown in the fourth book, is really a constant\nsuffering, or at the least, as will be shown further on in the 28th\nchapter, a business which does not cover its expenses; thus that clinging\nto life can only be founded in the _subject_ of it. But it is not founded\nin the _intellect_, it is no result of reflection, and in general is not a\nmatter of choice; but this willing of life is something that is taken for\ngranted: it is a _prius_ of the intellect itself. We ourselves are the\nwill to live, and therefore we must live, well or ill. Only from the fact\nthat this clinging to a life which is so little worth to them is entirely\n_a priori_ and not a _posteriori_ can we explain the excessive fear of\ndeath that dwells in every living thing, which Rochefoucauld has expressed\nin his last reflection, with rare frankness and naïveté, and upon which\nthe effect of all tragedies and heroic actions ultimately rest, for it\nwould be lost if we prized life only according to its objective worth.\nUpon this inexpressible _horror mortis_ is also founded the favourite\nprinciple of all ordinary minds, that whosoever takes his own life must be\nmad; yet not less the astonishment, mingled with a certain admiration,\nwhich this action always excites even in thinking minds, because it is so\nopposed to the nature of all living beings that in a certain sense we are\nforced to admire him who is able to perform it. For suicide proceeds from\na purpose of the intellect, but our will to live is a _prius_ of the\nintellect. Thus this consideration also, which will be fully discussed in\nchapter 28, confirms the primacy of the will in self-consciousness.\n\n12. On the other hand, nothing proves more clearly the secondary,\ndependent, conditioned nature of the _intellect_ than its periodical\nintermittance. In deep sleep all knowing and forming of ideas ceases. But\nthe kernel of our nature, the metaphysical part of it which the organic\nfunctions necessarily presuppose as their _primum mobile_, must never\npause if life is not to cease, and, moreover, as something metaphysical\nand therefore incorporeal, it requires no rest. Therefore the philosophers\nwho set up a _soul_ as this metaphysical kernel, _i.e._, an originally and\nessentially _knowing_ being, see themselves forced to the assertion that\nthis soul is quite untiring in its perceiving and knowing, therefore\ncontinues these even in deep sleep; only that we have no recollection of\nthis when we awake. The falseness of this assertion, however, was easy to\nsee whenever one had rejected that _soul_ in consequence of Kant’s\nteaching. For sleep and waking prove to the unprejudiced mind in the\nclearest manner that knowing is a secondary function and conditioned by\nthe organism, just like any other. Only the _heart_ is untiring, because\nits beating and the circulation of the blood are not directly conditioned\nby nerves, but are just the original manifestation of the will. Also all\nother physiological functions governed merely by ganglionic nerves, which\nhave only a very indirect and distant connection with the brain, are\ncarried on during sleep, although the secretions take place more slowly;\nthe beating of the heart itself, on account of its dependence upon\nrespiration, which is conditioned by the cerebral system (_medulla\noblongata_), becomes with it a little slower. The stomach is perhaps most\nactive in sleep, which is to be attributed to its special consensus with\nthe now resting brain, which occasions mutual disturbances. The _brain_\nalone, and with it knowing, pauses entirely in deep sleep. For it is\nmerely the minister of foreign affairs, as the ganglion system is the\nminister of the interior. The brain, with its function of knowing, is only\na _vedette_ established by the will for its external ends, which, up in\nthe watch-tower of the head, looks round through the windows of the senses\nand marks where mischief threatens and where advantages are to be looked\nfor, and in accordance with whose report the will decides. This _vedette_,\nlike every one engaged on active service, is then in a condition of strain\nand effort, and therefore it is glad when, after its watch is completed,\nit is again withdrawn, as every watch gladly retires from its post. This\nwithdrawal is going to sleep, which is therefore so sweet and agreeable,\nand to which we are so glad to yield; on the other hand, being roused from\nsleep is unwelcome, because it recalls the _vedette_ suddenly to its post.\nOne generally feels also after the beneficent systole the reappearance of\nthe difficult diastole, the reseparation of the intellect from the will. A\nso-called _soul_, which was originally and radically a _knowing_ being,\nwould, on the contrary, necessarily feel on awaking like a fish put back\ninto water. In sleep, when merely the vegetative life is carried on, the\nwill works only according to its original and essential nature,\nundisturbed from without, with no diminution of its power through the\nactivity of the brain and the exertion of knowing, which is the heaviest\norganic function, yet for the organism merely a means, not an end;\ntherefore, in sleep the whole power of the will is directed to the\nmaintenance and, where it is necessary, the improvement of the organism.\nHence all healing, all favourable crises, take place in sleep; for the\n_vis naturæ medicatrix_ has free play only when it is delivered from the\nburden of the function of knowledge. The embryo which has still to form\nthe body therefore sleeps continuously, and the new-born child the greater\npart of its time. In this sense Burdach (_Physiologie_, vol. iii. p. 484)\nquite rightly declares sleep to be the _original state_.\n\nWith reference to the brain itself, I account to myself for the necessity\nof sleep more fully through an hypothesis which appears to have been first\nset up in Neumann’s book, “_Von den Krankheiten des Menschen_,” 1834, vol.\n4,",

    "page_content": "its substance from the blood, cannot go on while we are awake, because the\nvery eminent organic function of knowing and thinking would be disturbed\nor put an end to by the low and material function of nutrition. This\nexplains the fact that sleep is not a purely negative condition, a mere\npausing of the activity of the brain, but also shows a positive character.\nThis makes itself known through the circumstance that between sleep and\nwaking there is no mere difference of degree, but a fixed boundary, which,\nas soon as sleep intervenes, declares itself in dreams which are\ncompletely different from our immediately preceding thoughts. A further\nproof of this is that when we have dreams which frighten us we try in vain\nto cry out, or to ward off attacks, or to shake off sleep; so that it is\nas if the connecting-link between the brain and the motor nerves, or\nbetween the cerebrum and the cerebellum (as the regulator of movements)\nwere abolished; for the brain remains in its isolation and sleep holds us\nfast as with brazen claws. Finally, the positive character of sleep can be\nseen in the fact that a certain degree of strength is required for\nsleeping. Therefore too great fatigue or natural weakness prevent us from\nseizing it, _capere somnum_. This may be explained from the fact that the\n_process of nutrition_ must be introduced if sleep is to ensue: the brain\nmust, as it were, begin to feed. Moreover, the increased flow of blood\ninto the brain during sleep is explicable from the nutritive process; and\nalso the position of the arms laid together above the head, which is\ninstinctively assumed because it furthers this process: also why children,\nso long as their brain is still growing, require a great deal of sleep,\nwhile in old age, on the other hand, when a certain atrophy of the brain,\nas of all the parts, takes place, sleep is short; and finally why\nexcessive sleep produces a certain dulness of consciousness, the\nconsequence of a certain hypertrophy of the brain, which in the case of\nhabitual excess of sleep may become permanent and produce imbecility: ανιη\nκαι πολυς ὑπνος (_noxæ est etiam multus somnus_), Od. 15, 394. The need of\nsleep is therefore directly proportionate to the intensity of the\nbrain-life, thus to the clearness of the consciousness. Those animals\nwhose brain-life is weak and dull sleep little and lightly; for example,\nreptiles and fishes: and here I must remind the reader that the winter\nsleep is sleep almost only in name, for it is not an inaction of the brain\nalone, but of the whole organism, thus a kind of apparent death. Animals\nof considerable intelligence sleep deeply and long. Men also require more\nsleep the more developed, both as regards quantity and quality, and the\nmore active their brain is. Montaigne relates of himself that he had\nalways been a long sleeper, that he had passed a large part of his life in\nsleeping, and at an advanced age still slept from eight to nine hours at a\ntime (Liv. iii., chap. 13). Descartes also is reported to have slept a\ngreat deal (Baillet, _Vie de Descartes_, 1693, p. 288). Kant allowed\nhimself seven hours for sleep, but it was so hard for him to do with this\nthat he ordered his servant to force him against his will, and without\nlistening to his remonstrances, to get up at the set time (Jachmann,\n_Immanuel Kant_, p. 162). For the more completely awake a man is, _i.e._,\nthe clearer and more lively his consciousness, the greater for him is the\nnecessity of sleep, thus the deeper and longer he sleeps. Accordingly much\nthinking or hard brain-work increases the need of sleep. That sustained\nmuscular exertion also makes us sleepy is to be explained from the fact\nthat in this the brain continuously, by means of the _medulla oblongata_,\nthe spinal marrow, and the motor nerves, imparts the stimulus to the\nmuscles which affects their irritability, and in this way it exhausts its\nstrength. The fatigue which we observe in the arms and legs has\naccordingly its real seat in the brain; just as the pain which these parts\nfeel is really experienced in the brain; for it is connected with the\nmotor nerves, as with the nerves of sense. The muscles which are not\nactuated from the brain—for example, those of the heart—accordingly never\ntire. The same grounds explain the fact that both during and after great\nmuscular exertion we cannot think acutely. That one has far less energy of\nmind in summer than in winter is partly explicable from the fact that in\nsummer one sleeps less; for the deeper one has slept, the more completely\nawake, the more lively, is one afterwards. This, however, must not mislead\nus into extending sleep unduly, for then it loses in intension, _i.e._, in\ndeepness and soundness, what it gains in extension; whereby it becomes\nmere loss of time. This is what Goethe means when he says (in the second\npart of “Faust”) of morning slumber: “Sleep is husk: throw it off.” Thus\nin general the phenomenon of sleep most specially confirms the assertion\nthat consciousness, apprehension, knowing, thinking, is nothing original\nin us, but a conditioned and secondary state. It is a luxury of nature,\nand indeed its highest, which it can therefore the less afford to pursue\nwithout interruption the higher the pitch to which it has been brought. It\nis the product, the efflorescence of the cerebral nerve-system, which is\nitself nourished like a parasite by the rest of the organism. This also\nagrees with what is shown in our third book, that knowing is so much the\npurer and more perfect the more it has freed and severed itself from the\nwill, whereby the purely objective, the æsthetic comprehension appears.\nJust as an extract is so much the purer the more it has been separated\nfrom that out of which it is extracted and been cleared of all sediment.\nThe opposite is shown by the _will_, whose most immediate manifestation is\nthe whole organic life, and primarily the untiring heart.\n\nThis last consideration is related to the theme of the following chapter,\nto which it therefore makes the transition: yet the following observation\nbelongs to it. In magnetic somnambulism the consciousness is doubled: two\ntrains of knowledge, each connected in itself, but quite different from\neach other, arise; the waking consciousness knows nothing of the\nsomnambulent. But the will retains in both the same character, and remains\nthroughout identical; it expresses in both the same inclinations and\naversions. For the function may be doubled, but not the true nature.\n\nChapter XX.(34) Objectification Of The Will In The Animal Organism.\n\nBy _objectification_ I understand the self-exhibition in the real\ncorporeal world. However, this world itself, as was fully shown in the\nfirst book and its supplements, is throughout conditioned by the knowing\nsubject, thus by the intellect, and therefore as such is absolutely\ninconceivable outside the knowledge of this subject; for it primarily\nconsists simply of ideas of perception, and as such is a phenomenon of the\nbrain. After its removal the thing in itself would remain. That this is\nthe _will_ is the theme of the second book, and is there proved first of\nall in the human organism and in that of the brutes.\n\nThe knowledge of the external world may also be defined as the\n_consciousness of other things_, in opposition to _self-consciousness_.\nSince we have found in the latter that its true object or material is the\nwill, we shall now, with the same intention, take into consideration the\nconsciousness of other things, thus objective knowledge. Now here my\nthesis is this: _that which in self-consciousness, thus subjectively is\nthe intellect, presents itself in the consciousness of other things, thus\nobjectively, as the brain; and that which in self-consciousness, thus\nsubjectively, is the will, presents itself in the consciousness of other\nthings, thus objectively, as the whole organism_.\n\nTo the evidence which is given in support of this proposition, both in our\nsecond book and in the first two chapters of the treatise “_Ueber den\nWillen in der Natur_,” I add the following supplementary remarks and\nillustrations.\n\nNearly all that is necessary to establish the first part of this thesis\nhas already been brought forward in the preceding chapter, for in the\nnecessity of sleep, in the alterations that arise from age, and in the\ndifferences of the anatomical conformation, it was proved that the\nintellect is of a secondary nature, and depends absolutely upon a single\norgan, the brain, whose function it is, just as grasping is the function\nof the hand; that it is therefore physical, like digestion, not\nmetaphysical, like the will. As good digestion requires a healthy, strong\nstomach, as athletic power requires muscular sinewy arms, so extraordinary\nintelligence requires an unusually developed, beautifully formed brain of\nexquisitely fine texture and animated by a vigorous pulse. The nature of\nthe will, on the contrary, is dependent upon no organ, and can be\nprognosticated from none. The greatest error in Gall’s phrenology is that\nhe assigns organs of the brain for moral qualities also. Injuries to the\nhead, with loss of brain substance, affect the intellect as a rule very\ndisadvantageously: they result in complete or partial imbecility or\nforgetfulness of language, permanent or temporary, yet sometimes only of\none language out of several which were known, also in the loss of other\nknowledge possessed, &c., &c. On the other hand, we never read that after\na misfortune of this kind the _character_ has undergone a change, that the\nman has perhaps become morally worse or better, or has lost certain\ninclinations or passions, or assumed new ones; never. For the will has not\nits seat in the brain, and moreover, as that which is metaphysical, it is\nthe _prius_ of the brain, as of the whole body, and therefore cannot be\naltered by injuries of the brain. According to an experiment made by\nSpallanzani and repeated by Voltaire,(35) a snail that has had its head\ncut off remains alive, and after some weeks a new head grows on, together\nwith horns; with this consciousness and ideas again appear; while till\nthen the snail had only given evidence of blind will through unregulated\nmovements. Thus here also we find the will as the substance which is\npermanent, the intellect, on the contrary, conditioned by its organ, as\nthe changing accident. It may be defined as the regulator of the will.\n\nIt was perhaps Tiedemann who first compared the cerebral nervous system to\na _parasite_ (_Tiedemann und Trevirann’s Journal für Physiologie_, Bd. i.\n§ 62). The comparison is happy; for the brain, together with the spinal\ncord and nerves which depend upon it, is, as it were, implanted in the\norganism, and is nourished by it without on its part _directly_\ncontributing anything to the support of the economy of the organism;\ntherefore there can be life without a brain, as in the case of brainless\nabortions, and also in the case of tortoises, which live for three weeks\nafter their heads have been cut off; only the _medulla oblongata_, as the\norgan of respiration, must be spared. Indeed a hen whose whole brain\nFlourens had cut away lived for ten months and grew. Even in the case of\nmen the destruction of the brain does not produce death directly, but only\nthrough the medium of the lungs, and then of the heart (_Bichat, Sur la\nVie et la Mort_, Part ii., art. ii. § 1). On the other hand, the brain\ncontrols the relations to the external world; this alone is its office,\nand hereby it discharges its debt to the organism which nourishes it,\nsince its existence is conditioned by the external relations. Accordingly\nthe brain alone of all the parts requires sleep, because its _activity_ is\ncompletely distinct from its _support_; the former only consumes both\nstrength and substance, the latter is performed by the rest of the\norganism as the nurse of the brain: thus because its activity contributes\nnothing to its continued existence it becomes exhausted, and only when it\npauses in sleep does its nourishment go on unhindered.\n\nThe second part of our thesis, stated above, will require a fuller\nexposition even after all that I have said about it in the writings\nreferred to. I have shown above, in chapter 18, that the thing in itself,\nwhich must lie at the foundation of every phenomenon, and therefore of our\nown phenomenal existence also, throws off in self-consciousness _one_ of\nits phenomenal forms—space, and only retains the other—time. On this\naccount it presents itself here more immediately than anywhere else, and\nwe claim it as will, according to its most undisguised manifestation. But\nno _permanent substance_, such as matter is, can present itself in time\nalone, because, as § 4 of the first volume showed, such a substance is\nonly possible through the intimate union of space and time. Therefore, in\nself-consciousness the will is not apprehended as the enduring substratum\nof its impulses, therefore is not perceived as a permanent substance; but\nonly its individual acts, such as purposes, wishes, and emotions, are\nknown successively and during the time they last, directly, yet not\nperceptibly. The knowledge of the will in self-consciousness is\naccordingly not a _perception_ of it, but a perfectly direct becoming\naware of its successive impulses. On the other hand, for the knowledge\nwhich is directed _outwardly_, brought about by the senses and perfected\nin the understanding, which, besides time, has also space for its form,\nwhich two it connects in the closest manner by means of the function of\nthe understanding, causality, whereby it really becomes _perception_—this\nknowledge presents to itself _perceptibly_ what in inner immediate\napprehension was conceived as will, as _organic body_, whose particular\nmovements visibly present to us the acts, and whose parts and forms\nvisibly present to us the sustained efforts, the fundamental character, of\nthe individually given will, nay, whose pain and comfort are perfectly\nimmediate affections of this will itself.\n\nWe first become aware of this identity of the body with the will in the\nindividual actions of the two, for in these what is known in\nself-consciousness as an immediate, real act of will, at the same time and\nunseparated, exhibits itself outwardly as movement of the body; and every\none beholds the purposes of his will, which are instantaneously brought\nabout by motives which just as instantaneously appear at once as\nfaithfully copied in as many actions of his body as his body itself is\ncopied in his shadow; and from this, for the unprejudiced man, the\nknowledge arises in the simplest manner that his body is merely the\noutward manifestation of his will, _i.e._, the way in which his will\nexhibits itself in his perceiving intellect, or his will itself under the\nform of the idea. Only if we forcibly deprive ourselves of this primary\nand simple information can we for a short time marvel at the process of\nour own bodily action as a miracle, which then rests on the fact that\nbetween the act of will and the action of the body there is really no\ncausal connection, for they are directly _identical_, and their apparent\ndifference only arises from the circumstance that here what is one and the\nsame is apprehended in two different modes of knowledge, the outer and the\ninner. Actual willing is, in fact, inseparable from doing and in the\nstrictest sense only that is an act of will which the deed sets its seal\nto. Mere resolves of the will, on the contrary, till they are carried out,\nare only intentions, and are therefore matter of the intellect alone; as\nsuch they have their place merely in the brain, and are nothing more than\ncompleted calculations of the relative strength of the different opposing\nmotives. They have, therefore, certainly great probability, but no\ninfallibility. They may turn out false, not only through alteration of the\ncircumstances, but also from the fact that the estimation of the effect of\nthe respective motives upon the will itself was erroneous, which then\nshows itself, for the deed is untrue to the purpose: therefore before it\nis carried out no resolve is certain. The _will itself_, then, is\noperative only in real action; hence in muscular action, and consequently\nin _irritability_. Thus the _will_ proper objectifies itself in this. The\ncerebrum is the place of motives, where, through these, the will becomes\nchoice, _i.e._, becomes more definitely determined by motives. These\nmotives are ideas, which, on the occasion of external stimuli of the\norgans of sense, arise by means of the functions of the brain, and are\nalso worked up into conceptions, and then into resolves. When it comes to\nthe real act of will these motives, the workshop of which is the cerebrum,\nact through the medium of the cerebellum upon the spinal cord and the\nmotor nerves which proceed from it, which then act upon the muscles, yet\nmerely as _stimuli_ of their irritability; for galvanic, chemical, and\neven mechanical stimuli can effect the same contraction which the motor\nnerve calls forth. Thus what was _motive_ in the brain acts, when it\nreaches the muscle through the nerves, as mere stimulus. Sensibility in\nitself is quite unable to contract a muscle. This can only be done by the\nmuscle itself, and its capacity for doing so is called _irritability_,\n_i.e._, _susceptibility to stimuli_. It is exclusively a property of the\nmuscle, as sensibility is exclusively a property of the nerve. The latter\nindeed gives the muscle the _occasion_ for its contraction, but it is by\nno means it that, in some mechanical way, draws the muscle together; but\nthis happens simply and solely on account of the _irritability_, which is\na power of the muscle itself. Apprehended from without this is a _Qualitas\nocculta_, and only self-consciousness reveals it as the _will_. In the\ncausal chain here briefly set forth, from the effect of the motive lying\noutside us to the contraction of the muscle, the will does not in some way\ncome in as the last link of the chain; but it is the metaphysical\nsubstratum of the irritability of the muscle: thus it plays here precisely\nthe same part which in a physical or chemical chain of causes is played by\nthe mysterious forces of nature which lie at the foundation of the\nprocess—forces which as such are not themselves involved as links in the\ncausal chain, but impart to all the links of it the capacity to act, as I\nhave fully shown in § 26 of the first volume. Therefore we would ascribe\nthe contraction of the muscle also to a similar mysterious force of\nnature, if it were not that this contraction is disclosed to us by an\nentirely different source of knowledge—self-consciousness as _will_.\nHence, as was said above, if we start from the will our own muscular\nmovement appears to us a miracle; for indeed there is a strict causal\nchain from the external motive to the muscular action; but the will itself\nis not included as a link in it, but, as the metaphysical substratum of\nthe possibility of an action upon the muscle through brain and nerve, lies\nat the foundation of the present muscular action also; therefore the\nlatter is not properly its _effect_ but its _manifestation_. As such it\nenters the world of idea, the form of which is the law of causality, a\nworld which is entirely different from the _will_ in itself: and thus, if\nwe start from the _will_, this manifestation has, for attentive\nreflection, the appearance of a miracle, but for deeper investigation it\naffords the most direct authentication of the great truth that what\nappears in the phenomenon as body and its action is in itself _will_. If\nnow perhaps the motor nerve that leads to my hand is severed, the will can\nno longer move it. This, however, is not because the hand has ceased to\nbe, like every part of my body, the objectivity, the mere visibility, of\nmy will, or in other words, that the irritability has vanished, but\nbecause the effect of the motive, in consequence of which alone I can move\nmy hand, cannot reach it and act on its muscles as a stimulus, for the\nline of connection between it and the brain is broken. Thus really my will\nis, in this part, only deprived of the effect of the motive. The will\nobjectifies itself directly, in irritability, not in sensibility.\n\nIn order to prevent all misunderstandings about this important point,\nespecially such as proceed from physiology pursued in a purely empirical\nmanner, I shall explain the whole process somewhat more thoroughly. My\ndoctrine asserts that the whole body is the will itself, exhibiting itself\nin the perception of the brain; consequently, having entered into its\nforms of knowledge. From this it follows that the will is everywhere\nequally present in the whole body, as is also demonstrably the case, for\nthe organic functions are its work no less than the animal. But how, then,\ncan we reconcile it with this, that the _voluntary_ actions, those most\nundeniable expressions of the will, clearly originate in the brain, and\nthus only through the spinal cord reach the nerve fibres, which finally\nset the limbs in motion, and the paralysis or severing of which therefore\nprevents the possibility of voluntary movement? This would lead one to\nthink that the will, like the intellect, has its seat only in the brain,\nand, like it, is a mere function of the brain.\n\nYet this is not the case: but the whole body is and remains the exhibition\nof the will in perception, thus the will itself objectively perceived by\nmeans of the functions of the brain. That process, however, in the case of\nthe acts of will, depends upon the fact that the will, which, according to\nmy doctrine, expresses itself in every phenomenon of nature, even in\nvegetable and inorganic phenomena, appears in the bodies of men and\nanimals as a _conscious will_. A _consciousness_, however, is essentially\na unity, and therefore always requires a central point of unity. The\nnecessity of consciousness is, as I have often explained, occasioned by\nthe fact that in consequence of the increased complication, and thereby\nmore multifarious wants, of an organism, the acts of its will must be\nguided by _motives_, no longer, as in the lower grades, by mere stimuli.\nFor this purpose it had at this stage to appear provided with a knowing\nconsciousness, thus with an intellect, as the medium and place of the\nmotives. This intellect, if itself objectively perceived, exhibits itself\nas the brain, together with its appendages, spinal cord, and nerves. It is\nthe brain now in which, on the occasion of external impressions, the ideas\narise which become motives for the will. But in the _rational_ intellect\nthey undergo besides this a still further working up, through reflection\nand deliberation. Thus such an intellect must first of all unite in _one_\npoint all impressions, together with the working up of them by its\nfunctions, whether to mere perception or to conceptions, a point which\nwill be, as it were, the focus of all its rays, in order that that unity\nof consciousness may arise which is the the _theoretical ego_, the\nsupporter of the whole consciousness, in which it presents itself as\nidentical with the _willing ego_, whose mere function of knowledge it is.\nThat point of unity of consciousness, or the theoretical ego, is just\nKant’s synthetic unity of apperception, upon which all ideas string\nthemselves as on a string of pearls, and on account of which the “I\nthink,” as the thread of the string of pearls, “must be capable of\naccompanying all our ideas.”(36) This assembling-place of the motives,\nthen, where their entrance into the single focus of consciousness takes\nplace, is the brain. Here, in the non-rational consciousness, they are\nmerely perceived; in the _rational_ consciousness they are elucidated by\nconceptions, thus are first thought in the abstract and compared; upon\nwhich the will chooses, in accordance with its individual and immutable\ncharacter, and so the _purpose_ results which now, by means of the\ncerebellum, the spinal cord, and the nerves, sets the outward limbs in\nmotion. For although the will is quite directly present in these, inasmuch\nas they are merely its manifestation, yet when it has to move according to\nmotives, or indeed according to reflection, it requires such an apparatus\nfor the apprehension and working up of ideas into such motives, in\nconformity with which its acts here appear as resolves: just as the\nnourishment of the blood with chyle requires a stomach and intestines, in\nwhich this is prepared, and then as such is poured into the blood through\nthe _ductus thoracicus_, which here plays the part which the spinal cord\nplays in the former case. The matter may be most simply and generally\ncomprehended thus: the will is immediately present as irritability in all\nthe muscular fibres of the whole body, as a continual striving after\nactivity in general. Now if this striving is to realise itself, thus to\nmanifest itself as movement, this movement must as such have some\ndirection; but this direction must be _determined_ by something, _i.e._,\nit requires a guide, and this is the nervous system. For to the mere\nirritability, as it lies in the muscular fibres and in itself is pure\nwill, all directions are alike; thus it determines itself in no direction,\nbut behaves like a body which is equally drawn in all directions; it\nremains at rest. Since the activity of the nerves comes in as motive (in\nthe case of reflex movements as a stimulus), the striving force, _i.e._,\nthe irritability, receives a definite direction, and now produces the\nmovements. Yet those external acts of will which require no motives, and\nthus also no working up of mere stimuli into ideas in the brain, from\nwhich motives arise, but which follow immediately upon stimuli, for the\nmost part inward stimuli, are the reflex movements, starting only from the\nspinal cord, as, for example, spasms and cramp, in which the will acts\nwithout the brain taking part. In an analogous manner the will carries on\nthe organic life, also by nerve stimulus, which does not proceed from the\nbrain. Thus the will appears in every muscle as irritability, and is\nconsequently of itself in a position to contract them, yet only _in\ngeneral_; in order that some definite contraction should take place at a\ngiven moment, there is required here, as everywhere, a cause, which in\nthis case must be a stimulus. This is everywhere given by the nerve which\ngoes into the muscle. If this nerve is in connection with the brain, then\nthe contraction is a conscious act of will, _i.e._, takes place in\naccordance with motives, which, in consequence of _external_ impressions,\nhave arisen as ideas in the brain. If the nerve is _not_ in connection\nwith the brain, but with the _sympathicus maximus_, then the contraction\nis involuntary and unconscious, an act connected with the maintenance of\nthe organic life, and the nerve stimulus which causes it is occasioned by\n_inward_ impressions; for example, by the pressure upon the stomach of the\nfood received, or of the chyme upon the intestines, or of the in-flowing\nblood upon the walls of the heart, in accordance with which the act is\ndigestion, or _motus peristalticus_, or beating of the heart, &c.\n\nBut if now, in this process, we go one step further, we find that the\nmuscles are the product of the blood, the result of its work of\ncondensation, nay, to a certain extent they are merely solidified, or, as\nit were, clotted or crystallised blood; for they have taken up into\nthemselves, almost unaltered, its fibrin (_cruor_) and its colouring\nmatter (_Burdach’s Physiologie_, Bd. v. § 686). But the force which forms\nthe muscle out of the blood must not be assumed to be different from that\nwhich afterwards moves it as irritability, upon nerve stimulus, which the\nbrain supplies; in which case it then presents itself in\nself-consciousness as that which we call _will_. The close connection\nbetween the blood and irritability is also shown by this, that where, on\naccount of imperfection of the lesser circulation, part of the blood\nreturns to the heart unoxidised, the irritability is also uncommonly weak,\nas in the batrachia. Moreover, the movement of the blood, like that of the\nmuscle, is independent and original; it does not, like irritation, require\nthe influence of the nerve, and is even independent of the heart, as is\nshown most clearly by the return of the blood through the veins to the\nheart; for here it is not propelled by a _vis a tergo_, as in the case of\nthe arterial circulation; and all other mechanical explanations, such as a\npower of suction of the right ventricle of the heart, are quite\ninadequate. (See _Burdach’s Physiologie_, Bd. 4, § 763, and _Rösch, Ueber\ndie Bedeutung des Blutes, § II, seq._) It is remarkable to see how the\nFrench, who recognise nothing but mechanical forces, controvert each other\nwith insufficient grounds upon both sides; and Bichat ascribes the flowing\nback of the blood through the veins to the pressure of the walls of the\ncapillary tubes, and Magendie, on the other hand, to the continue action\nof the impulse of the heart (_Précis de Physiologie par Magendie_, vol.\nii. p. 389). That the movement of the blood is also independent of the\nnervous system, at least of the cerebral nervous system, is shown by the\nfetus, which (according to _Müller’s Physiologie_), without brain and\nspinal cord, has yet circulation of the blood. And Flourens also says:\n“_Le mouvement du cœur, pris en soi, et abstraction faite de tout ce qui\nn’est pas essentiellement lui, comme sa durée, son énergie, ne dépend ni\nimmédiatement, ni coinstantanément, du système nerveux central, et\nconséquemment c’est dans tout autre point de ce système que dans les\ncentres nerveux eux-mêmes, qu’il faut chercher le principe primitif et\nimmédiat de ce mouvement_” (_Annales des sciences naturelles p. Audouin et\nBrougniard_, 1828, vol. 13). Cuvier also says: “_La circulation survit à\nla déstruction de tout l’encéphale et de toute la moëlle épiniaire_ (_Mém.\nde l’acad. d. sc._, 1823, vol. 6; _Hist. d. l’acad. p. Cuvier_,” p. cxxx).\n“_Cor primum vivens et ultimum moriens_,” says Haller. The beating of the\nheart ceases at last in death. The blood has made the vessels themselves;\nfor it appears in the ovum earlier than they do; they are only its path,\nvoluntarily taken, then beaten smooth, and finally gradually condensed and\nclosed up; as Kaspar Wolff has already taught: “_Theorie der Generation_,”\n§ 30-35. The motion of the heart also, which is inseparable from that of\nthe blood, although occasioned by the necessity of sending blood into the\nlungs, is yet an original motion, for it is independent of the nervous\nsystem and of sensibility, as Burdach fully shows. “In the heart,” he\nsays, “appears, with the maximum of irritability, a minimum of\nsensibility” (_loc. cit._, § 769). The heart belongs to the muscular\nsystem as well as to the blood or vascular system; from which, however, it\nis clear that the two are closely related, indeed constitute one whole.\nSince now the metaphysical substratum of the force which moves the muscle,\nthus of irritability, is the _will_, the will must also be the\nmetaphysical substratum of the force which lies at the foundation of the\nmovement and the formations of the blood, as that by which the muscles are\nproduced. The course of the arteries also determines the form and size of\nall the limbs; consequently the whole form of the body is determined by\nthe course of the blood. Thus in general the blood, as it nourishes all\nthe parts of the body, has also, as the primary fluidity of the organism,\nproduced and framed them out of itself. And the nourishment which\nconfessedly constitutes the principal function of the blood is only the\ncontinuance of that original production of them. This truth will be found\nthoroughly and excellently explained in the work of Rösch referred to\nabove: “_Ueber die Bedeutung des Blutes_,” 1839. He shows that the blood\nis that which first has life and is the source both of the existence and\nof the maintenance of all the parts; that all the organs have sprung from\nit through secretion, and together with them, for the management of their\nfunctions, the nervous system, which appears now as _plastic_, ordering\nand arranging the life of the particular parts within, now as _cerebral_,\ncontrolling the relation to the external world. “The blood,” he says, p.\n25, “was flesh and nerve at once, and at the same moment at which the\nmuscle freed itself from it the nerve, severed in like manner, remained\nopposed to the flesh.” Here it is a matter of course that the blood,\nbefore those solid parts have been secreted from it, has also a somewhat\ndifferent character from afterwards; it is then, as Rösch defines it, the\nchaotic, animated, slimy, primitive fluid, as it were an organic emulsion,\nin which all subsequent parts are _implicite_ contained: moreover, it has\nnot the red colour quite at the beginning. This disposes of the objection\nwhich might be drawn from the fact that the brain and the spinal cord\nbegin to form before the circulation of the blood is visible or the heart\nappears. In this reference also Schultz says (_System der Circulation_, §\n297): “We do not believe that the view of Baūmgärten, according to which\nthe nervous system is formed earlier than the blood, can consistently be\ncarried out; for Baūmgärten reckons the appearance of the blood only from\nthe formation of the corpuscles, while in the embryo and in the series of\nanimals blood appears much earlier in the form of a pure plasma.” The\nblood of invertebrate animals never assumes the red colour; but we do not\ntherefore, with Aristotle, deny that they have any. It is well worthy of\nnote that, according to the account of Justinus Kerner (_Geschichte zweier\nSomnambulen_, § 78), a somnambulist of a very high degree of clairvoyance,\nsays: “I am as deep in myself as ever a man can be led; the force of my\nmortal life seems to me to have its source in the blood, whereby, through\nthe circulation in the veins, it communicates itself, by means of the\nnerves, to the whole body, and to the brain, which is the noblest part of\nthe body, and above the blood itself.”\n\nFrom all this it follows that the will objectifies itself most immediately\nin the blood as that which originally makes and forms the organism,\nperfects it by growth, and afterwards constantly maintains it, both by the\nregular renewal of all the parts and by the extraordinary restoration of\nany part that may have been injured. The first productions of the blood\nare its own vessels, and then the muscles, in the irritability of which\nthe will makes itself known to self-consciousness; but with this also the\nheart, which is at once vessel and muscle, and therefore is the true\ncentre and _primum mobile_ of the whole life. But for the individual life\nand subsistence in the external world the will now requires two assistant\nsystems: _one_ to govern and order its inner and outer activity, and\n_another_ for the constant renewal of the mass of the blood; thus a\ncontroller and a sustainer. It therefore makes for itself the nervous and\nthe intestinal systems; thus the _functiones animales_ and the _functiones\nnaturales_ associate themselves in a subsidiary manner with the\n_functiones vitales_, which are the most original and essential. In the\n_nervous system_, accordingly, the will only objectifies itself in an\nindirect and secondary way; for this system appears as a mere auxiliary\norgan, as a contrivance by means of which the will attains to a knowledge\nof those occasions, internal and external, upon which, in conformity with\nits aims, it must express itself; the internal occasions are received by\nthe _plastic_ nervous system, thus by the sympathetic nerve, this\n_cerebrum abdominale_, as mere stimuli, and the will thereupon reacts on\nthe spot without the brain being conscious; the _outward_ occasions are\nreceived by the brain, as _motives_, and the will reacts through conscious\nactions directed outwardly. Therefore the whole nervous system\nconstitutes, as it were, the antennæ of the will, which it stretches\ntowards within and without. The nerves of the brain and spinal cord\nseparate at their roots into sensory and motory nerves. The sensory nerves\nreceive the knowledge from without, which now accumulates in the thronging\nbrain, and is there worked up into ideas, which arise primarily as\nmotives. But the motory nerves bring back, like couriers, the result of\nthe brain function to the muscle, upon which it acts as a stimulus, and\nthe irritability of which is the immediate manifestation of the will.\nPresumably the plastic nerves also divide into sensory and motory,\nalthough on a subordinate scale. The part which the ganglia play in the\norganism we must think of as that of a diminutive brain, and thus the one\nthrows light upon the other. The ganglia lie wherever the organic\nfunctions of the vegetative system require care. It is as if there the\nwill was not able by its direct and simple action to carry out its aims,\nbut required guidance, and consequently control; just as when in some\nbusiness a man’s own memory is not sufficient, and he must constantly take\nnotes of what he does. For this end mere knots of nerves are sufficient\nfor the interior of the organism, because everything goes on within its\nown compass. For the exterior, on the other hand, a very complicated\ncontrivance of the same kind is required. This is the brain with its\nfeelers, which it stretches into the outer world, the nerves of sense. But\neven in the organs which are in communication with this great nerve\ncentre, in very simple cases the matter does not need to be brought before\nthe highest authority, but a subordinate one is sufficient to determine\nwhat is needed; such is the spinal cord, in the reflex actions discovered\nby Marshall Hall, such as sneezing, yawning, vomiting, the second half of\nswallowing, &c. &c. The will itself is present in the whole organism,\nsince this is merely its visible form; the nervous system exists\neverywhere merely for the purpose of making the _direction_ of an action\npossible by a control of it, as it were to serve the will as a mirror, so\nthat it may see what it does, just as we use a mirror to shave by. Hence\nsmall sensoria arise within us for special, and consequently simple,\nfunctions, the ganglia; but the chief sensorium, the brain, is the great\nand skilfully contrived apparatus for the complicated and multifarious\nfunctions which have to do with the ceaselessly and irregularly changing\nexternal world. Wherever in the organism the nerve threads run together in\na ganglion, there, to a certain extent, an animal exists for itself and\nshut off, which by means of the ganglion has a kind of weak knowledge, the\nsphere of which is, however, limited to the part from which these nerves\ndirectly come. But what actuates these parts to such _quasi_ knowledge is\nclearly the _will_; indeed we are utterly unable to conceive it otherwise.\nUpon this depends the _vita propria_ of each part, and also in the case of\ninsects, which, instead of a spinal cord, have a double string of nerves,\nwith ganglia at regular intervals, the capacity of each part to continue\nalive for days after being severed from the head and the rest of the\ntrunk; and finally also the actions which in the last instance do not\nreceive their motives from the brain, _i.e._, instinct and natural\nmechanical skill. Marshall Hall, whose discovery of the reflex movements I\nhave mentioned above, has given us in this the _theory of involuntary\nmovements_. Some of these are normal or physiological; such are the\nclosing of the places of ingress to and egress from the body, thus of the\n_sphincteres vesicæ et ani_ (proceeding from the nerves of the spinal\ncord); the closing of the eyelids in sleep (from the fifth pair of\nnerves), of the larynx (from _N. vagus_) if food passes over it or\ncarbonic acid tries to enter; also swallowing, from the pharynx, yawning\nand sneezing, respiration, entirely in sleep and partly when awake; and,\nlastly, the erection, ejaculation, as also conception, and many more.\nSome, again, are abnormal and pathological; such are stammering,\nhiccoughing, vomiting, also cramps and convulsions of every kind,\nespecially in epilepsy, tetanus, in hydrophobia and otherwise; finally,\nthe convulsive movements produced by galvanic or other stimuli, and which\ntake place without feeling or consciousness in paralysed limbs, _i.e._, in\nlimbs which are out of connection with the brain, also the convulsions of\nbeheaded animals, and, lastly, all movements and actions of children born\nwithout brains. All cramps are a rebellion of the nerves of the limbs\nagainst the sovereignty of the brain; the normal reflex movements, on the\nother hand, are the legitimate autocracy of the subordinate officials.\nThese movements are thus all involuntary, because they do not proceed from\nthe brain, and therefore do not take place in accordance with motives, but\nfollow upon mere stimuli. The stimuli which occasion them extend only to\nthe spinal cord or the _medulla oblongata_, and from there the reaction\ndirectly takes place which effects the movement. The spinal cord has the\nsame relation to these involuntary movements as the brain has to motive\nand action, and what the sentient and voluntary nerve is for the latter\nthe incident and motor nerve is for the former. That yet, in the one as in\nthe other, that which really moves is the _will_ is brought all the more\nclearly to light because the involuntarily moved muscles are for the most\npart the same which, under other circumstances, are moved from the brain\nin the voluntary actions, in which their _primum mobile_ is intimately\nknown to us through self-consciousness as the _will_. Marshall Hall’s\nexcellent book “On the Diseases of the Nervous System” is peculiarly\nfitted to bring out clearly the difference between volition and will, and\nto confirm the truth of my fundamental doctrine.\n\nFor the sake of illustrating all that has been said, let us now call to\nmind that case of the origination of an organism which is most accessible\nto our observation. Who makes the chicken in the egg? Some power and skill\ncoming from without, and penetrating through the shell? Oh no! The chicken\nmakes itself, and the force which carries out and perfects this work,\nwhich is complicated, well calculated, and designed beyond all expression,\nbreaks through the shell as soon as it is ready, and now performs the\noutward actions of the chicken, under the name of _will_. It cannot do\nboth at once; previously occupied with the perfecting of the organism, it\nhad no care for without. But after it has completed the former, the latter\nappears, under the guidance of the brain and its feelers, the senses, as a\ntool prepared beforehand for this end, the service of which only begins\nwhen it grows up in self-consciousness as intellect, which is the lantern\nto the steps of the will, its ἡγεμονικον, and also the supporter of the\nobjective external world, however limited the horizon of this may be in\nthe consciousness of a hen. But what the hen is now able to do in the\nexternal world, through the medium of this organ, is, as accomplished by\nmeans of something secondary, infinitely less important than what it did\nin its original form, for it made itself.\n\nWe became acquainted above with the cerebral nervous system as an\n_assistant organ_ of the will, in which it therefore objectifies itself in\na secondary manner. As thus the cerebral system, although not directly\ncoming within the sphere of the life-functions of the organism, but only\ngoverning its relations to the outer world, has yet the organism as its\nbasis, and is nourished by it in return for its services; and as thus the\ncerebral or animal life is to be regarded as the production of the organic\nlife, the brain and its function, knowledge, thus the intellect, belong\nindirectly and in a subordinate manner to the manifestation of the _will_.\nThe will objectifies itself also in it, as will to apprehend the external\nworld, thus as _will to know_. Therefore great and fundamental as is the\ndifference in us between willing and knowing, the ultimate substratum of\nboth is yet the same, the _will_, as the real inner nature of the whole\nphenomenon. But knowing, the intellect, which presents itself in\nself-consciousness entirely as secondary, is to be regarded not only as\nthe accident of the will, but also as its work, and thus, although in a\ncircuitous manner, is yet to be referred to it. As the intellect presents\nitself physiologically as the function of an organ of the body,\nmetaphysically it is to be regarded as a work of the will, whose\nobjectification or visible appearance is the whole body. Thus the will _to\nknow_, objectively perceived, is the brain; as the will _to go_,\nobjectively perceived, is the foot; the will _to grasp_, the hand; the\nwill _to digest_, the stomach; the will _to beget_, the genitals, &c. This\nwhole objectification certainly ultimately exists only for the brain, as\nits perception: in this the will exhibits itself as organised body. But so\nfar as the brain knows, it is _itself_ not known, but is the _knower_, the\nsubject of all knowledge. So far, however, as in objective perception,\n_i.e._, in the consciousness of _other things_, thus secondarily, _it is\nknown_, it belongs, as an organ of the body, to the objectification of the\nwill. For the whole process is the _self-knowledge of the will_; it starts\nfrom this and returns to it, and constitutes what Kant has called the\n_phenomenon_ in opposition to the thing in itself. Therefore that which is\n_known_, that which is _idea_, is the _will_; and this idea is what we\ncall body, which, as extended in space and moving in time, exists only by\nmeans of the functions of the brain, thus only in it. That, on the other\nhand, which _knows_, which _has that idea_, is the _brain_, which yet does\nnot know itself, but only becomes conscious of itself subjectively as\nintellect, _i.e._, as the _knower_. That which when regarded from within\nis the faculty of knowledge is when regarded from without the brain. This\nbrain is a part of that body, just because it itself belongs to the\nobjectification of the _will_, the will’s _will to know_ is objectified in\nit, its tendency towards the external world. Accordingly the brain, and\ntherefore the intellect, is certainly conditioned immediately by the body,\nand this again by the brain, yet only indirectly, as spatial and\ncorporeal, in the world of perception, not in itself, _i.e._, as will.\nThus the whole is ultimately the will, which itself becomes idea, and is\nthat unity which we express by I. The brain itself, so far as it is\n_perceived_—thus in the consciousness of other things, and hence\nsecondarily—is only idea. But in itself, and so far as it _perceives_, it\nis the will, because this is the real substratum of the whole phenomenon;\nits will to know objectifies itself as brain and its functions. We may\ntake the voltaic pile as an illustration, certainly imperfect, but yet to\nsome extent throwing light upon the nature of the human phenomenon, as we\nhere regard it. The metals, together with the fluid, are the body; the\nchemical action, as the basis of the whole effect, is the will, and the\nelectric current resulting from it, which produces shock and spark, is the\nintellect. But _omne simile claudicat_.\n\nQuite recently the _physiatrica_ point of view has at last prevailed in\npathology. According to it diseases are themselves a curative process of\nnature, which it introduces to remove, by overcoming its causes, a\ndisorder which in some way has got into the organism. Thus in the decisive\nbattle, the crisis, it is either victorious and attains its end, or else\nis defeated. This view only gains its full rationality from our\nstandpoint, which shows the _will_ in the vital force, that here appears\nas _vis naturœ medicatrix_, the will which lies at the foundation of all\norganic functions in a healthy condition, but now, when disorder has\nentered, threatening its whole work, assumes dictatorial power in order to\nsubdue the rebellious forces by quite extraordinary measures and entirely\nabnormal operations (the disease), and bring everything back to the right\ntrack. On the other hand, that the _will itself_ is sick, as Brandis\nrepeatedly expresses himself in his book, “_Ueber die Anwendung der\nKälte_,” which I have quoted in the first part of my essay, “_Ueber den\nWillen in der Natur_,” is a gross misunderstanding. When I weigh this, and\nat the same time observe that in his earlier book, “_Ueber die\nLebenskraft_,” of 1795, Brandis betrayed no suspicion that this force is\nin itself the will, but, on the contrary, says there, page 13: “It is\nimpossible that the vital force can be that which we only know through our\nconsciousness, for most movements take place without our consciousness.\nThe assertion that this, of which the only characteristic known to us is\nconsciousness, also affects the body without consciousness is at the least\nquite arbitrary and unproved;” and page 14: “Haller’s objections to the\nopinion that all living movements are the effect of the soul are, as I\nbelieve, quite unanswerable;” when I further reflect that he wrote his\nbook, “_Ueber die Anwendung der Kälte_,” in which all at once the will\nappears so decidedly as the vital force, in his seventieth year, an age at\nwhich no one as yet has conceived for the first time original fundamental\nthoughts; when, lastly, I bear in mind that he makes use of my exact\nexpressions, “will and idea,” and not of those which are far more commonly\nused by others, “the faculties of desire and of knowledge,” I am now\nconvinced, contrary to my earlier supposition, that he borrowed his\nfundamental thought from me, and with the usual honesty which prevails at\nthe present day in the learned world, said nothing about it. The\nparticulars about this will be found in the second (and third) edition of\nmy work, “_Ueber den Willen in der Natur_,” p. 14.\n\nNothing is more fitted to confirm and illustrate the thesis with which we\nare occupied in this chapter than Bichat’s justly celebrated book, “_Sur\nla vie et la mort_.” His reflections and mine reciprocally support each\nother, for his are the physiological commentary on mine, and mine are the\nphilosophical commentary on his, and one will best understand us both by\nreading us together. This refers specially to the first half of his work,\nentitled “_Recherches physiologiques sur la vie_.” He makes the foundation\nof his expositions the opposition of the _organic_ to the _animal_ life,\nwhich corresponds to mine of the will to the intellect. Whoever looks at\nthe sense, not at the words, will not allow himself to be led astray by\nthe fact that he ascribes the will to the animal life; for by will, as is\nusual, he only understands conscious volition, which certainly proceeds\nfrom the brain, where, however, as was shown above, it is not yet actual\nwilling, but only deliberation upon and estimation of the motives, the\nconclusion or product of which at last appears as the act of will. All\nthat I ascribe to the _will_ proper he ascribes to the _organic_ life, and\nall that I conceive as _intellect_ is with him the _animal_ life: the\nlatter has with him its seat in the brain alone, together with its\nappendages: the former, again, in the whole of the remainder of the\norganism. The complete opposition in which he shows that the two stand to\neach other corresponds to that which with me exists between the will and\nthe intellect. As anatomist and physiologist he starts from the objective,\nthat is, from the consciousness of other things; I, as a philosopher,\nstart from the subjective, self-consciousness; and it is a pleasure to see\nhow, like the two voices in a duet, we advance in harmony with each other,\nalthough each expresses something different. Therefore, let every one who\nwishes to understand me read him; and let every one who wishes to\nunderstand him, better than he understood himself, read me. Bichat shows\nus, in article 4, that the _organic_ life begins earlier and ends later\nthan the _animal_ life; consequently, since the latter also rests in\nsleep, has nearly twice as long a duration; then, in articles 8 and 9,\nthat the organic life performs everything perfectly, at once, and of its\nown accord; the animal life, on the other hand, requires long practice and\neducation. But he is most interesting in the sixth article, where he shows\nthat the _animal_ life is completely limited to the intellectual\noperations, therefore goes on coldly and indifferently, while the emotions\nand passions have their seat in the _organic_ life, although the occasions\nof them lie in the animal, _i.e._, the cerebral, life. Here he has ten\nvaluable pages which I wish I could quote entire. On page 50 he says: “_Il\nest sans doute étonnant, que les passions n’ayent jamais leur terme ni\nleur origine dans les divers organs de la vie animale; qu’au contraire les\nparties servant aux fonctions internes, soient constamment affectées par\nelles, et même les déterminent suivant l’état où elles se trouvent. Tel\nest cependant ce que la stricte observation nous prouve. Je dis d’abord\nque l’effet de toute espèce de passion, constamment étranger à la vie\nanimale, est de faire naître un changement, une altération quelconque dans\nla vie organique._” Then he shows in detail how anger acts on the\ncirculation of the blood and the beating of the heart, then how joy acts,\nand lastly how fear; next, how the lungs, the stomach, the intestines, the\nliver, glands, and pancreas are affected by these and kindred emotions,\nand how grief diminishes the nutrition; and then how the animal, that is,\nthe brain life, is untouched by all this, and quietly goes on its way. He\nrefers to the fact that to signify intellectual operations we put the hand\nto the head, but, on the contrary, we lay it on the heart, the stomach,\nthe bowels, if we wish to express our love, joy, sorrow, or hatred; and he\nremarks that he must be a bad actor who when he spoke of his grief would\ntouch his head, and when he spoke of his mental effort would touch his\nheart; and also that while the learned make the so-called soul reside in\nthe head, the common people always indicate the well-felt difference\nbetween the affections of the intellect and the will by the right\nexpression, and speak, for example, of a capable, clever, fine head; but,\non the other hand, say a good heart, a feeling heart, and also “Anger\nboils in my veins,” “Stirs my gall,” “My bowels leap with joy,” “Jealousy\npoisons my blood,” &c. “_Les chants sont le langage des passions, de la\nvie organique, comme la parole ordinaire __ est celui de l’entendement, de\nla vie animale: la déclamation, tient le milieu, elle anime la langue\nfroide du cerveau par la langue expressive des organes intérieurs, du\ncœur, du foie, de l’estomac_,” &c. His conclusion is: “_La vie organique\nest le terme où aboutissent, et le centre d’où partent les passions_.”\nNothing is better fitted than this excellent and thorough book to confirm\nand bring out clearly that the body is only the embodied (_i.e._,\nperceived by means of the brain functions, time, space, and causality)\nwill itself, from which it follows that the will is the primary and\noriginal, the intellect, as mere brain function, the subordinate and\nderived. But that which is most worthy of admiration, and to me most\npleasing, in Bichat’s thought is, that this great anatomist, on the path\nof his purely physiological investigations, actually got so far as to\nexplain the unalterable nature of the _moral character_ from the fact that\nonly the _animal_ life, thus the functions of the brain, are subject to\nthe influence of education, practice, culture, and habit, but the moral\ncharacter belongs to the _organic_ life, _i.e._, to all the other parts,\nwhich cannot be modified from without. I cannot refrain from giving the\npassage; it occurs in article 9, § 2: “_Telle est donc la grande\ndifférence des deux vies de l’animal_” (cerebral or animal and organic\nlife) “_par rapport à l’inégalité de perfection des divers systèmes de\nfonctions, dont chacune résulte; savoir, que dans l’une la prédominance ou\nl’infériorité d’un système relativement aux autres, tient presque toujours\nà l’activité ou à l’inertie plus grandes de ce système, à l’habitude\nd’agir ou de ne pas agir; que dans l’autre, au contraire, cette\nprédominance ou cette infériorité sont immédiatement liées a la texture\ndes organes, et jamais à leur éducation. Voilà pourquoi le tempérament\nphysique et le_ CHARACTÈRE MORAL _ne sont point susceptible de changer par\nl’éducation, qui modifie si prodigieusement les actes de la vie animale;\ncar, comme nous l’avons vu, tous deux_ APPARTIENNENT À LA VIE ORGANIQUE.\n_La charactère est, si je puis m’exprimer ainsi, la physionomie des\npassions; le tempérament est celle des fonctions __ internes: or les unes\net les autres étant toujours les mêmes, ayant une direction que l’habitude\net l’exercice ne dérangent jamais, il est manifeste que le tempérament et\nle charactère doivent être aussi soustraits à l’empire de l’éducation.\nElle peut modérer l’influence du second, perfectionner assez le jugement\net la réflection, pour rendre leur empire supérieur au sien, fortifier la\nvie animal afin qu’elle résiste aux impulsions de l’organique. Mais\nvouloir par elle dénaturer le charactère, adoucir ou exalter les passions\ndont il est l’expression habituelle, agrandir ou resserrer leur sphère,\nc’est une entreprise analogue a celle d’un médecin qui essaierait d’élever\nou d’abaisser de quelque degrés, et pour toute la vie, la force de\ncontraction ordinaire au cœur dans l’état de santé, de précipiter ou de\nralentir habituellement le mouvement naturel aux artères, et qui est\nnécessaire à leur action, etc. Nous observerions à ce médecin, que la\ncirculation, la respiration, etc., ne sont point sous le domaine de la\nvolonté_ (volition), _quelles ne peuvent être modifiées par l’homme, sans\npasser à l’état maladif, etc. Faisons la même observation à ceux qui\ncroient qu’on change le charactère, et par-là, même les_ PASSIONS,\n_puisque celles-ci sont un_ PRODUIT DE L’ACTION DE TOUS LES ORGANES\nINTERNES, _ou qu’elles y ont au moins spécialement leur siège._” The\nreader who is familiar with my philosophy may imagine how great was my joy\nwhen I discovered, as it were, the proof of my own convictions in those\nwhich were arrived at upon an entirely different field, by this\nextraordinary man, so early taken from the world.\n\nA special authentication of the truth that the organism is merely the\nvisibility of the will is also afforded us by the fact that if dogs, cats,\ndomestic cocks, and indeed other animals, bite when violently angry, the\nwounds become mortal; nay, if they come from a dog, may cause hydrophobia\nin the man who is bitten, without the dog being mad or afterwards becoming\nso. For the extremest anger is only the most decided and vehement will to\nannihilate its object; this now appears in the assumption by the saliva of\nan injurious, and to a certain extent magically acting, power, and springs\nfrom the fact that the will and the organism are in truth one. This also\nappears from the fact that intense vexation may rapidly impart to the\nmother’s milk such a pernicious quality that the sucking child dies\nforthwith in convulsions (_Most, Ueber sympathetische Mittel_, p. 16).\n\nNote On What Has Been Said About Bichat.\n\nBichat has, as we have shown above, cast a deep glance into human nature,\nand in consequence has given an exceedingly admirable exposition, which is\none of the most profound works in the whole of French literature. Now,\nsixty years later, M. Flourens suddenly appears with a polemic against it\nin his work, “_De la vie et de l’intelligence_,” and makes so bold as to\ndeclare without ceremony that all that Bichat has brought to light on this\nimportant subject, which was quite his own, is false. And what does he\noppose to him in the field? Counter reasons? No, counter assertions(37)\nand authorities, indeed, which are as inadmissible as they are\nremarkable—Descartes and Gall! M. Flourens is by conviction a Cartesian,\nand to him Descartes, in the year 1858, is still “_le philosophe par\nexcellence_.” Now Descartes was certainly a great man, yet only as a\nforerunner. In the whole of his dogmas, on the other hand, there is not a\nword of truth; and to appeal to these as authorities at this time of day\nis simply absurd. For in the nineteenth century a Cartesian in philosophy\nis just what a follower of Ptolemy would be in astronomy, or a follower of\nStahl in chemistry. But for M. Flourens the dogmas of Descartes are\narticles of faith. Descartes has taught, _les volontés sont des pensées_:\ntherefore this is the case, although every one feels within himself that\nwilling and thinking are as different as white and black. Hence I have\nbeen able above, in chapter 19, to prove and explain this fully and\nthoroughly, and always under the guidance of experience. But above all,\naccording to Descartes, the oracle of M. Flourens, there are two\nfundamentally different substances, body and soul. Consequently M.\nFlourens, as an orthodox Cartesian, says: “_Le premier point est de\nséparer, même par les mots, ce qui est du corps de ce qui est de l’âme_”\n(i. 72). He informs us further that this “_âme réside uniquement et\nexclusivement dans le cerveau_” (ii. 137); from whence, according to a\npassage of Descartes, it sends the _spiritus animales_ as couriers to the\nmuscles, yet can only itself be affected by the brain; therefore the\npassions have their seat (_siège_) in the heart, which is altered by them,\nyet their place (_place_) in the brain. Thus, really thus, speaks the\noracle of M. Flourens, who is so much edified by it, that he even utters\nit twice after him (i. 33 and ii. 135), for the unfailing conquest of the\nignorant Bichat, who knows neither soul nor body, but merely an animal and\nan organic life, and whom he then here condescendingly informs that we\nmust thoroughly distinguish the parts where the passions have their _seat_\n(_siègent_) from those which they _affect_. According to this, then, the\npassions _act_ in one place while they _are_ in another. Corporeal things\nare wont to act only where they are, but with an immaterial soul the case\nmay be different. But what in general may he and his oracle really have\nthought in this distinction of _place_ and _siège_, of _sièger_ and\n_affecter_? The fundamental error of M. Flourens and Descartes springs\nreally from the fact that they confound the motives or occasions of the\npassions, which, as ideas, certainly lie in the intellect, _i.e._, in the\nbrain, with the passions themselves, which, as movements of the will, lie\nin the whole body, which (as we know) is the perceived will itself. M.\nFlourens’ second authority is, as we have said, Gall. I certainly have\nsaid, at the beginning of this twentieth chapter (and already in the\nearlier edition): “The greatest error in Gall’s phrenology is, that he\nmakes the brain the organ of moral qualities also.” But what I censure and\nreject is precisely what M. Flourens praises and admires, for he bears in\nhis heart the doctrine of Descartes: “_Les volontés sont des pensées._”\nAccordingly he says, p. 144: “_Le premier service que Gall a rendu à la\nphysiologie (?) a éte de rammener le moral à l’intellectuel, et de faire\nvoir que les facultés morales et les facultés intellectuelles sont du même\nordre, et de les placer toutes, autant les unes que les autres, uniquement\net exclusivement dans le cerveau._” To a certain extent my whole\nphilosophy, but especially the nineteenth chapter of this volume, consists\nof the refutation of this fundamental error. M. Flourens, on the contrary,\nis never tired of extolling this as a great truth and Gall as its\ndiscoverer; for example, p. 147: “_Si j’en étais à classer les services\nque nous a rendu Gall, je dirais que le premier a été de rammener les\nqualités morales au cerveau_;”—p. 153: “_Le cerveau seul est l’organe de\nl’âme, et de l’âme dans toute la plénitude de ses fonctions_” (we see the\nsimple soul of Descartes still always lurks in the background, as the\nkernel of the matter); “_il est le siège de toutes les facultés\nintellectuelles.... Gall a rammené_ LE MORAL A L’INTELLECTUEL, _il a\nrammené les qualités morales au même siège, au même organe, que les\nfacultés intellectuelles_.” Oh how must Bichat and I be ashamed of\nourselves in the presence of such wisdom! But, to speak seriously, what\ncan be more disheartening, or rather more shocking, than to see the true\nand profound rejected and the false and perverse extolled; to live to find\nthat important truths, deeply hidden, and extracted late and with\ndifficulty, are to be torn down, and the old, stale, and late conquered\nerrors set up in their place; nay, to be compelled to fear that through\nsuch procedure the advances of human knowledge, so hardly achieved, will\nbe broken off! But let us quiet our fears; for _magma est vis veritatis et\nprævalebit_. M. Flourens is unquestionably a man of much merit, but he has\nchiefly acquired it upon the experimental path. Just those truths,\nhowever, which are of the greatest importance cannot be brought out by\nexperiments, but only by reflection and penetration. Now Bichat by his\nreflection and penetration has here brought a truth to light which is of\nthe number of those which are unattainable by the experimental efforts of\nM. Flourens, even if, as a true and consistent Cartesian, he tortures a\nhundred more animals to death. But he ought betimes to have observed and\nthought something of this: “Take care, friend, for it burns.” The\npresumption and self-sufficiency, however, such as is only imparted by\nsuperficiality combined with a false obscurity, with which M. Flourens\nundertakes to refute a thinker like Bichat by counter assertions, old\nwives’ beliefs, and futile authorities, indeed to reprove and instruct\nhim, and even almost to mock at him, has its origin in the nature of the\nAcademy and its _fauteuils_. Throned upon these, and saluting each other\nmutually as _illustre confrère_, gentlemen cannot avoid making themselves\nequal with the best who have ever lived, regarding themselves as oracles,\nand therefore fit to decree what shall be false and what true. This impels\nand entitles me to say out plainly for once, that the really superior and\nprivileged minds, who now and then are born for the enlightenment of the\nrest, and to whom certainly Bichat belongs, are so “by the grace of God,”\nand accordingly stand to the Academy (in which they have generally\noccupied only the forty-first _fauteuil_) and to its _illustres\nconfrères_, as born princes to the numerous representatives of the people,\nchosen from the crowd. Therefore a secret awe should warn these gentlemen\nof the Academy (who always exist by the score) before they attack such a\nman,—unless they have most cogent reasons to present, and not mere\ncontradictions and appeals to _placita_ of Descartes, which at the present\nday is quite absurd.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n    1 Bruno and Spinoza are here entirely to be excepted. They stand each\n      for himself and alone, and belong neither to their age nor their\n      quarter of the globe, which rewarded the one with death and the\n      other with persecution and insult. Their miserable existence and\n      death in this Western world is like that of a tropical plant in\n      Europe. The banks of the sacred Ganges were their true spiritual\n      home; there they would have led a peaceful and honoured life among\n      men of like mind. In the following lines, with which Bruno begins\n      his book _Della Causa Principio et Uno_, for which he was brought to\n      the stake, he expresses clearly and beautifully how lonely he felt\n      himself in his age, and he also shows a presentiment of his fate\n      which led him to delay the publication of his views, till that\n      inclination to communicate what one knows to be true, which is so\n      strong in noble minds, prevailed:\n\n      “_Ad partum properare tuum, mens ægra, quid obstat;_\n      _ Seclo hæc indigno sint tribuenda licet?_\n      _ Umbrarum fluctu terras mergente, cacumen_\n      _ Adtolle in clarum, noster Olympe, Jovem._”\n\n      Whoever has read this his principal work, and also his other Italian\n      writings, which were formerly so rare, but are now accessible to all\n      through a German edition, will find, as I have done, that he alone\n      of all philosophers in some degree approaches to Plato, in respect\n      of the strong blending of poetical power and tendency along with the\n      philosophical, and this he also shows especially in a dramatic form.\n      Imagine the tender, spiritual, thoughtful being, as he shows himself\n      to us in this work of his, in the hands of coarse, furious priests\n      as his judges and executioners, and thank Time which brought a\n      brighter and a gentler age, so that the after-world whose curse was\n      to fall on those fiendish fanatics is the world we now live in.\n\n    2 Bayard Taylor’s translation of “Faust,” vol. i. p. 14.—TRS.\n\n    3 “Faust,” scene vi., Bayard Taylor’s translation, vol. i. p.\n      134.—TRS.\n\n    4 Observe here that I always quote the “Kritik der reinen Vernunft”\n      according to the paging of the first edition, for in Rosenkranz’s\n      edition of Kant’s collected works this paging is always given in\n      addition. Besides this, I add the paging of the fifth edition,\n      preceded by a V.; all the other editions, from the second onwards,\n      are the same as the fifth, and so also is their paging.\n\n    5 Cf. Christian Wolf’s “_Vernünftige Gedanken von Gott, Welt und\n      Seele_,” § 577-579. It is strange that he only explains as\n      contingent what is necessary according to the principle of\n      sufficient reason of becoming, _i.e._, what takes place from causes,\n      and on the contrary recognises as necessary that which is so\n      according to the other forms of the principle of sufficient reason;\n      for example, what follows from the _essentia_ (definition), thus\n      analytical judgments, and further also mathematical truths. The\n      reason he assigns for this is, that only the law of causality gives\n      infinite series, while the other kinds of grounds give only finite\n      series. Yet this is by no means the case with the forms of the\n      principle of sufficient reason in pure space and time, but only\n      holds good of the logical ground of knowledge; but he held\n      mathematical necessity to be such also. Compare the essay on the\n      principle of sufficient reason,",

    "page_content": "6 With my refutation of the Kantian proof may be compared the earlier\n      attacks upon it by Feder, _Ueber Zeit, Raum und Kausalität_, § 28;\n      and by G. E. Schulze, _Kritik der theoretischen Philosophie_, Bd.\n      ii. S. 422-442.\n\n    7 See _Sext. Empir. Pyrrhon. hypotyp._, lib. i. c. 13, νοουμενα\n      φαινομενοις αντετιθη Αναξαγορας (intelligibilia apparentibus\n      opposuit Anaxagoras).\n\n    8 That the assumption of a limit of the world in time is certainly not\n      a necessary thought of the reason may be also proved historically,\n      for the Hindus teach nothing of the kind, even in the religion of\n      the people, much less in the Vedas, but try to express\n      mythologically by means of monstrous chronology the infinity of this\n      phenomenal world, this fleeting and baseless web of Mâyâ, for they\n      at once bring out very ingeniously the relativity of all periods of\n      time in the following mythus (Polier, _Mythologie des Indous_, vol.\n      ii. p. 585). The four ages, in the last of which we live, embrace\n      together 4,320,000 years. Each day of the creating Brahma has 1000\n      such periods of four ages, and his nights have also 1000. His year\n      has 365 days and as many nights. He lives 100 of his years, always\n      creating; and if he dies, at once a new Brahma is born, and so on\n      from eternity to eternity. The same relativity of time is also\n      expressed in the special myth which is quoted in Polier’s work, vol.\n      ii. p. 594, from the Puranas. In it a Rajah, after a visit of a few\n      seconds to Vishnu in his heaven, finds on his return to earth that\n      several millions of years have elapsed, and a new age has begun; for\n      every day of Vishnu is 100 recurrences of the four ages.\n\n    9 Kant said, “It is very absurd to expect enlightenment from reason,\n      and yet to prescribe to her beforehand which side she must\n      necessarily take” (“Critique of Pure Reason,” p. 747; V. 775). On\n      the other hand, the following is the naive assertion of a professor\n      of philosophy in our own time: “If a philosophy denies the reality\n      of the fundamental ideas of Christianity, it is either false, or,\n      _even if true, it is yet useless_.” That is to say, for professors\n      of philosophy. It was the late Professor Bachmann who, in the Jena\n      _Litteraturzeitung_ for July 1840, No. 126, so indiscreetly blurted\n      out the maxim of all his colleagues. However, it is worth noticing,\n      as regards the characteristics of the University philosophy, how\n      here the truth, if it will not suit and adapt itself, is shown the\n      door without ceremony, with, “Be off, truth! we cannot make _use_ of\n      you. Do we owe you anything? Do you pay us? Then be off!”\n\n   10 By the way, Machiavelli’s problem was the solution of the question\n      how the prince, _as a prince_, was to keep himself on the throne in\n      spite of internal and external enemies. His problem was thus by no\n      means the ethical problem whether a prince, as a man, ought to will\n      such things, but purely the political one how, if he so wills, he\n      can carry it out. And the solution of this problem he gives just as\n      one writes directions for playing chess, with which it would be\n      folly to mix up the answer to the question whether from an ethical\n      point of view it is advisable to play chess at all. To reproach\n      Machiavelli with the immorality of his writing is just the same as\n      to reproach a fencing-master because he does not begin his\n      instructions with a moral lecture against murder and slaughter.\n\n   11 Although the conception of legal right is properly negative in\n      opposition to that of wrong, which is the positive starting-point,\n      yet the explanation of these conceptions must not on this account be\n      entirely negative.\n\n   12 I specially recommend here the passage in Lichtenberg’s\n      “Miscellaneous Writings” (Göthingen, 1801, vol. ii. p. 12): “Euler\n      says, in his letters upon various subjects in connection with\n      natural science (vol. ii. p. 228), that it would thunder and lighten\n      just as well if there were no man present whom the lightning might\n      strike. It is a very common expression, but I must confess that it\n      has never been easy for me completely to comprehend it. It always\n      seems to me as if the conception _being_ were something derived from\n      our thought, and thus, if there are no longer any sentient and\n      thinking creatures, then there is nothing more whatever.”\n\n   13 Lichtenberg says in his “_Nachrichten und Bemerkungen von und über\n      sich selbst_” (_Vermischte Schriften, Göttingen_, 1800, vol. i. p.\n      43): “I am extremely sensitive to all noise, but it entirely loses\n      its disagreeable character as soon as it is associated with a\n      rational purpose.”\n\n   14 That the three-toed sloth has nine must be regarded as a mistake;\n      yet Owen still states this, “_Ostéologie Comp._,” p. 405.\n\n   15 This, however, does not excuse a professor of philosophy who,\n      sitting in Kant’s chair, expresses himself thus: “That mathematics\n      as such contains arithmetic and geometry is correct. It is\n      incorrect, however, to conceive arithmetic as the science of time,\n      really for no other reason than to give a pendant (_sic_) to\n      geometry as the science of space” (Rosenkranz in the “_Deutschen\n      Museum_,” 1857, May 14, No. 20). This is the fruit of Hegelism. If\n      the mind is once thoroughly debauched with its senseless jargon,\n      serious Kantian philosophy will no longer enter it. The audacity to\n      talk at random about what one does not understand has been inherited\n      from the master, and one comes in the end to condemn without\n      ceremony the fundamental teaching of a great genius in a tone of\n      peremptory decision, just as if it were Hegelian foolery. We must\n      not, however, fail to notice that these little people struggle to\n      escape from the track of great thinkers. They would therefore have\n      done better not to attack Kant, but to content themselves with\n      giving their public full details about God, the soul, the actual\n      freedom of the will, and whatever belongs to that sort of thing, and\n      then to have indulged in a private luxury in their dark back-shop,\n      the philosophical journal; there they may do whatever they like\n      without constraint, for no one sees it.\n\n   16 This chapter, along with the one which follows it, is connected with\n      § 8 and 9 of the first book.\n\n   17 Illgen’s “_Zeitschrift für Historische Theologie_,” 1839, part i, p.\n      182.\n\n_   18 Gall et Spurzheim_, “_Des Dispositions Innées_,” 1811, p. 253.\n\n   19 This chapter is connected with § 12 of the first volume.\n\n   20 This chapter is connected with § 13 of the first volume.\n\n   21 This chapter and the one which follows it are connected with § 9 of\n      the first volume.\n\n   22 This chapter is connected with the conclusion of § 9 of the first\n      volume.\n\n   23 This chapter is connected with § 14 of the first volume.\n\n   24 A principal use of the study of the ancients is that it preserves us\n      from _verbosity_; for the ancients always take pains to write\n      concisely and pregnantly, and the error of almost all moderns is\n      verbosity, which the most recent try to make up for by suppressing\n      syllables and letters. Therefore we ought to pursue the study of the\n      ancients all our life, although reducing the time devoted to it. The\n      ancients knew that we ought not to write as we speak. The moderns,\n      on the other hand, are not even ashamed to print lectures they have\n      delivered.\n\n   25 This chapter is connected with § 15 of the first volume.\n\n   26 This chapter is connected with § 16 of the first volume.\n\n   27 This chapter is connected with § 15 of the first volume.\n\n   28 [Bayard Taylor’s translation of Faust, vol. i. 180. Trs.]\n\n   29 This chapter is connected with § 18 of the first volume.\n\n   30 This chapter is connected with § 19 of the first volume.\n\n   31 It is remarkable that Augustine already knew this. In the fourteenth\n      book, “_De Civ.

    "page_content": "is no mechanical assistance, no make‐shift, as if nature had made the\nplants yesterday, and had committed an error which she tries to correct\nto‐day through the insect; it is rather a deep‐lying sympathy between the\nplant and the animal worlds. It ought to reveal the identity of the two.\nBoth, children of one mother, ought to subsist with each other and through\neach other.” And further on: “But the organised world stands in such a\nsympathy with the unorganised world also,” &c. A proof of this _consensus\nnaturæ_ is also afforded by the observation communicated in the second\nvolume of the “Introduction into Entomology” by Kirby and Spence, that the\ninsect eggs that pass the winter attached to the twigs of the trees, which\nserve as nourishment for their larvæ, are hatched exactly at the time at\nwhich the twig buds; thus, for example, the aphis of the birch a month\nearlier than that of the ash. Similarly, that the insects of perennial\nplants pass the winter upon these as eggs; but those of mere annuals,\nsince they cannot do this, in the state of pupæ.\n\nThree great men have entirely rejected teleology, or the explanation from\nfinal causes, and many small men have echoed them. These three are,\nLucretius, Bacon of Verulam, and Spinoza. But in the case of all three we\nknow clearly enough the source of this aversion, namely, that they\nregarded it as inseparable from speculative theology, of which, however,\nthey entertained so great a distrust (which Bacon indeed prudently sought\nto conceal) that they wanted to give it a wide berth. We find Leibnitz\nalso entirely involved in this prejudice, for, with characteristic\nnaïveté, he expresses it as something self‐evident in his _Lettre à M.\nNicaise_ (_Spinozæ op. ed Paulus_, vol. ii. p. 672): “_Les causes finales,\nou ce qui est la même chose, la consideration de la sagesse divine dans\nl’ordre des choses._” (The devil also _même chose_!) At the same point of\nview we find, indeed, Englishmen even at the present day. The Bridgewater‐\nTreatise‐men—Lord Brougham, &c.—nay, even Richard Owen also, in his\n“_Ostéologie Comparée_,” thinks precisely as Leibnitz, which I have\nalready found fault with in the first volume. To all these teleology is at\nonce also theology, and at every instance of design recognised in nature,\ninstead of thinking and learning to understand nature, they break at once\ninto the childish cry, “Design! design!” then strike up the refrain of\ntheir old wives’ philosophy, and stop their ears against all rational\narguments, such as, however, the great Hume has already advanced against\nthem.(5)\n\nThe ignorance of the Kantian philosophy now, after seventy years, which is\nreally a disgrace to Englishmen of learning, is principally responsible\nfor this whole outcast position of the English; and this ignorance, again,\ndepends, at least in great measure, upon the nefarious influence of the\ndetestable English clergy, with whom stultification of every kind is a\nthing after their own hearts, so that only they may be able still to hold\nthe English nation, otherwise so intelligent, involved in the most\ndegrading bigotry; therefore, inspired by the basest obscurantism, they\noppose with all their might the education of the people, the investigation\nof nature, nay, the advancement of all human knowledge in general; and\nboth by means of their connections and by means of their scandalous,\nunwarrantable wealth, which increases the misery of the people, they\nextend their influence even to university teachers and authors, who\naccordingly (for example, Th. Brown, “On Cause and Effect”) resort to\nsuppressions and perversions of every kind simply in order to avoid\nopposing even in a distant manner that “cold superstition” (as Pückler\nvery happily designates their religion, or the current arguments in its\nfavour).\n\nBut, on the other hand, the three great men of whom we are speaking, since\nthey lived long before the dawn of the Kantian philosophy, are to be\npardoned for their distrust of teleology on account of its origin; yet\neven Voltaire regarded the physico‐theological proof as irrefutable. In\norder, however, to go into this somewhat more fully: first of all, the\npolemic of Lucretius (iv. 824‐858) against teleology is so crude and\nclumsy that it refutes itself and convinces us of the opposite. But as\nregards Bacon (_De augm. scient._, iii. 4), he makes, in the first place,\nno distinction with reference to the use of final causes between organised\nand unorganised nature (which is yet just the principal matter), for, in\nhis examples of final causes, he mixes the two up together. Then he\nbanishes final causes from physics to metaphysics; but the latter is for\nhim, as it is still for many at the present day, identical with\nspeculative theology. From this, then, he regards final causes as\ninseparable, and goes so far in this respect that he blames Aristotle\nbecause he has made great use of final causes, yet without connecting them\nwith speculative theology (which I shall have occasion immediately\nespecially to praise). Finally, Spinoza (_Eth._ i. _prop._ 36, _appendix_)\nmakes it abundantly clear that he identifies teleology so entirely with\nphysico‐theology, against which he expresses himself with bitterness, that\nhe explains _Natura nihil frustra agere_: _hoc est, quod in usum hominum\nnon sit_: similarly, _Omnia naturalia tanquam ad suum utile media\nconsiderant, et credunt aliquem alium esse, qui illa media paraverit_; and\nalso: _Hinc statuerunt, Deos omnia in usum hominum fecisse et dirigere_.\nUpon this, then, he bases his assertion: _Naturam finem nullum sibi\npræfixum habere et omnes causas finales nihil, nisi humana esse figmenta_.\nHis aim merely was to block the path of theism; and he had quite rightly\nrecognised the physico‐theological proof as its strongest weapon. But it\nwas reserved for Kant really to refute this proof, and for me to give the\ncorrect exposition of its material, whereby I have satisfied the maxim:\n_Est enim verum \n\nAristotle, who just here shows his brilliant side, contrasts very\nadvantageously with these modern philosophers. He goes unprejudiced to\nnature, knows of no physico‐theology—such a thing has never entered his\nmind,—and he has never looked at the world for the purpose of seeing\nwhether it was a bungled piece of work. He is in his heart pure from all\nthis, for he also sets up hypotheses as to the origin of animals and men\n(_De generat. anim._, iii. 11) without lighting upon the physico‐\ntheological train of thought. He always says: “ἡ φυσις ποιει (_natura\nfacit_), never ἡ φυσις πεποιηται” (_natura facta est_). But after he has\ntruly and diligently studied nature, he finds that it everywhere proceeds\nteleologically, and he says: “ματην ὁρωμεν ουδεν ποιουσαν την φυσιν”\n(_naturam nihil frustra facere cernimus_), _De respir._, c. 10; and in the\nbooks, _De partibus animalium_, which are a comparative anatomy: “Ουδε\nπεριεργον ουδεν, ουτε ματην ἡ φυσις ποιει.—Ἡ φυσις ἑνεκα του ποιει\nπαντα.—Πανταχου δε λεγομεν τοδε τουδε ἑνεκα, ὁπου αν φαινηται τελος τι,\nπρος ὁ ἡ κινησις περαινει; ὡστε ειναι φανερον, ὁτι εστι τι τοιουτον, ὁ δη\nκαι καλουμεν φυσιν. Επει το σωμα οργανον; ἑνεκα τινος γαρ ἑκαστον των\nμοριων, ομοιως τε και το ὁλον.” (_Nihil supervacaneum, nihil frustra\nnatura facit.—Natura rei alicujus gratia facit omnia.—Rem autem hanc esse\nillius gratia asserere ubique solemus, quoties finem intelligimus aliquem,\nin quem motus terminetur; quocirca ejusmodi aliquid esse constat, quod\nNaturam vocamus. Est enim corpus instrumentum: nam membrum unumquodque __\nrei alicujus gratia est, tum vero totum ipsum._) At greater length, p. 633\nand 645 of the Berlin quarto edition, and also _De incessu animalium_, c.\n2: “Ἡ φυσις ουδεν ποιει ματην, αλλ᾽ αει, εκ των ενδεχομενων τῃ ουσιᾳ, περι\nἑκαστον γενος ζωου το αριστον.” (_Natura nihil frustra facit, sed semper\nex iis, quæ cuique animalium generis essentiæ contingunt, id quod optimum\nest._) But he expressly recommends teleology at the end of the books _De\ngeneratione animalium_, and blames Democritus for having denied it, which\nis just what Bacon, in his prejudice, praises in him. Especially, however,\nin the “Physica,” ii. 8, p. 198, Aristotle speaks _ex professo_ of final\ncauses, and establishes them as the true principle of the investigation of\nnature. In fact, every good and regular mind must, in considering\norganised nature, hit upon teleology, but unless it is determined by the\npreconceived opinions, by no means either upon physico‐theology or upon\nthe anthropo‐teleology condemned by Spinoza. With regard to Aristotle\ngenerally, I wish further to draw attention to the fact here, that his\nteaching, so far as it concerns _unorganised_ nature, is very defective\nand unserviceable, as in the fundamental conceptions of mechanics and\nphysics he accepts the most gross errors, which is the less pardonable,\nsince before him the Pythagoreans and Empedocles had been upon the right\npath and had taught much better. Empedocles indeed, as we learn from\nAristotle’s second book, _De cœlo_ (c. 1, p. 284), had already grasped the\nconception of a tangential force arising from rotation, and counteracting\ngravity, which Aristotle again rejects. Quite the reverse, however, is\nAristotle’s relation to the investigation of _organised_ nature. This is\nhis field; here the wealth of his knowledge, the keenness of his\nobservation, nay, sometimes the depth of his insight, astonish us. Thus,\nto give just one example, he already knew the antagonism in which in the\nruminants the horns and the teeth of the upper jaw stand to each other, on\naccount of which, therefore, the latter are wanting where the former are\nfound, and conversely (_De partib. anim._, iii. 2). Hence then, also his\ncorrect estimation of final causes.\n\nChapter XXVII. On Instinct And Mechanical Tendency.\n\nIt is as if nature had wished, in the mechanical tendencies of animals, to\ngive the investigator an illustrative commentary upon her works, according\nto final causes and the admirable design of her organised productions\nwhich is thereby introduced. For these mechanical tendencies show most\nclearly that creatures can work with the greatest decision and\ndefiniteness towards an end which they do not know, nay, of which they\nhave no idea. Such, for instance, is the bird’s nest, the spider’s web,\nthe ant‐lion’s pitfall, the ingenious bee‐hive, the marvellous termite\ndwelling, &c., at least for those individual animals that carry them out\nfor the first time; for neither the form of the perfected work nor the use\nof it can be known to them. Precisely so, however, does _organising_\nnature work; and therefore in the preceding chapter I gave the paradoxical\nexplanation of the final cause, that it is a motive which acts without\nbeing known. And as in working from mechanical tendency that which is\nactive is evidently and confessedly the _will_, so is it also really the\nwill which is active in the working of organising nature.\n\nOne might say, the will of animal creatures is set in motion in two\ndifferent ways: either by motivation or by instinct; thus from without, or\nfrom within; by an external occasion, or by an internal tendency; the\nformer is explicable because it lies before us without, the latter is\ninexplicable because it is merely internal. But, more closely considered,\nthe contrast between the two is not so sharp, indeed ultimately it runs\nback into a difference of degree. The motive also only acts under the\nassumption of an inner tendency, _i.e._, a definite quality of will which\nis called its _character_. The motive in each case only gives to this a\ndefinite direction—individualises it for the concrete case. So also\ninstinct, although a definite tendency of the will, does not act entirely,\nlike a spring, from within; but it also waits for some external\ncircumstance necessarily demanded for its action, which at least\ndetermines the time of its manifestation; such is, for the migrating bird,\nthe season of the year; for the bird that builds its nest, the fact of\npregnancy and the presence of the material for the nest; for the bee it\nis, for the beginning of the structure, the basket or the hollow tree, and\nfor the following work many individually appearing circumstances; for the\nspider, it is a well‐adapted corner; for the caterpillar, the suitable\nleaf; for egg‐laying insects, the for the most part very specially\ndetermined and often rare place, where the hatched larvæ will at once find\ntheir nourishment, and so on. It follows from this that in works of\nmechanical tendency it is primarily the instinct of these animals that is\nactive, yet subordinated also to their intellect. The instinct gives the\nuniversal, the rule; the intellect the particular, the application, in\nthat it directs the detail of the execution, in which therefore the work\nof these animals clearly adapts itself to the circumstances of the\nexisting case. According to all this, the difference between instinct and\nmere character is to be fixed thus: Instinct is a character which is only\nset in motion by a _quite specially determined_ motive, and on this\naccount the action that proceeds from it is always exactly of the same\nkind; while the character which is possessed by every species of animal\nand every individual man is certainly a permanent and unalterable quality\nof will, which can yet be set in motion by very different motives, and\nadapts itself to these; and on account of this the action proceeding from\nit may, according to its material quality, be very different, but yet will\nalways bear the stamp of the same character, and will therefore express\nand reveal this; so that for the knowledge of this character the material\nquality of the action in which it appears is essentially a matter of\nindifference. Accordingly we might explain instinct as a character which\nis beyond all measure one‐sided and strictly determined. It follows from\nthis exposition that being determined by mere motivation presupposes a\ncertain width of the sphere of knowledge, and consequently a more fully\ndeveloped intellect: therefore it is peculiar to the higher animals, quite\npre‐eminently, however, to man; while being determined by instinct only\ndemands as much intellect as is necessary to apprehend the one quite\nspecially determined motive, which alone and exclusively becomes the\noccasion for the manifestation of the instinct. Therefore it is found in\nthe case of an exceedingly limited sphere of knowledge, and consequently,\nas a rule, and in the highest degree, only in animals of the lower\nclasses, especially insects. Since, accordingly, the actions of these\nanimals only require an exceedingly simple and small motivation from\nwithout, the medium of this, thus the intellect or the brain, is very\nslightly developed in them, and their outward actions are for the most\npart under the same guidance as the inner, follow upon mere stimuli,\nphysiological functions, thus the ganglion system. This is, then, in their\ncase excessively developed; their principal nerve‐stem runs under the\nbelly in the form of two cords, which at every limb of the body form a\nganglion little inferior to the brain in size, and, according to Cuvier,\nthis nerve‐stem is an analogue not so much of the spinal cord as of the\ngreat sympathetic nerve. According to all this, instinct and action\nthrough mere motivation, stand in a certain antagonism, in consequence of\nwhich the former has its maximum in insects, and the latter in man, and\nthe actuation of other animals lies between the two in manifold gradations\naccording as in each the cerebral or the ganglion system is\npreponderatingly developed. Just because the instinctive action and the\ningenious contrivances of insects are principally directed from the\nganglion system, if we regard them as proceeding from the brain alone, and\nwish to explain them accordingly, we fall into absurdities, because we\nthen apply a false key. The same circumstance, however, imparts to their\naction a remarkable likeness to that of somnambulists, which indeed is\nalso explained as arising from the fact that, instead of the brain, the\nsympathetic nerve has undertaken the conduct of the outward actions also;\ninsects are accordingly, to a certain extent, natural somnambulists.\nThings which we cannot get at directly we must make comprehensible to\nourselves by means of an analogy. What has just been referred to will\naccomplish this in a high degree when assisted by the fact that in\nKieser’s “_Tellurismus_” (vol. ii. p. 250) a case is mentioned “in which\nthe command of the mesmerist to the somnambulist to perform a definite\naction in a waking state was carried out by him when he awoke, without\nremembering the command.” Thus it was as if he must perform that action\nwithout rightly knowing why. Certainly this has the greatest resemblance\nto what goes on in the case of mechanical instincts in insects. The young\nspider feels that it must spin its web, although it neither knows nor\nunderstands the aim of it. We are also reminded here of the dæmon of\nSocrates, on account of which he had the feeling that he must leave undone\nsome action expected of him, or lying near him, without knowing why—for\nhis prophetic dream about it was forgotten. We have in our own day quite\nwell‐authenticated cases analogous to this; therefore I only briefly call\nthese to mind. One had taken his passage on a ship, but when it was about\nto sail he positively would not go on board without being conscious of a\nreason;—the ship went down. Another goes with companions to a powder\nmagazine; when he has arrived in its vicinity he absolutely will not go\nany further, but turns hastily back, seized with anxiety he knows not\nwhy;—the magazine blows up. A third upon the ocean feels moved one night,\nwithout any reason, not to undress, but lays himself on the bed in his\nclothes and boots, and even with his spectacles on;—in the night the ship\ngoes on fire, and he is among the few who save themselves in the boat. All\nthis depends upon the dull after‐effect of forgotten fatidical dreams, and\ngives us the key to an analogous understanding of instinct and mechanical\ntendencies.\n\nOn the other hand, as has been said, the mechanical tendencies of insects\nreflect much light upon the working of the unconscious will in the inner\nfunctions of the organism and in its construction. For without any\ndifficulty we can see in the ant‐hill or the beehive the picture of an\norganism explained and brought to the light of knowledge. In this sense\nBurdach says (_Physiologie_, vol. ii. p. 22): “The formation and\ndepositing of the eggs is the part of the queen‐bee, and the care for the\ncultivation of them falls to the workers; thus in the former the ovary,\nand in the latter the uterus, is individualised.” In the insect society,\nas in the animal organism, the _vita propria_ of each part is subordinated\nto the life of the whole, and the care for the whole precedes that for\nparticular existence; indeed the latter is only conditionally willed, the\nformer unconditionally; therefore the individuals are even sacrificed\noccasionally for the whole, as we allow a limb to be taken off in order to\nsave the whole body. Thus, for example, if the path is closed by water\nagainst the march of the ants, those in front boldly throw themselves in\nuntil their corpses are heaped up into a dam for those that follow. When\nthe drones have become useless they are stung to death. Two queens in the\nhive are surrounded, and must fight with each other till one of them loses\nits life. The ant‐mother bites its own wings off after it has been\nimpregnated, for they would only be a hindrance to it in the work that is\nbefore it of tending the new family it is about to found under the earth\n(Kirby and Spence, vol. i.) As the liver will do nothing more than secrete\ngall for the service of the digestion, nay, will only itself exist for\nthis end—and so with every other part—the working bees also will do\nnothing more than collect honey, secrete wax, and make cells for the brood\nof the queen; the drones nothing more than impregnate; the queen nothing\nbut deposit eggs; thus all the parts work only for the maintenance of the\nwhole which alone is the unconditional end, just like the parts of the\norganism. The difference is merely that in the organism the will acts\nperfectly blindly in its primary condition; in the insect society, on the\nother hand, the thing goes on already in the light of knowledge, to which,\nhowever, a decided co‐operation and individual choice is only left in the\naccidents of detail, where it gives assistance and adopts what has to be\ncarried out to the circumstances. But the insects will the end as a whole\nwithout knowing it; just like organised nature working according to final\ncauses; even the choice of the means is not as a whole left to their\nknowledge, but only the more detailed disposition of them. Just on this\naccount, however, their action is by no means automatic, which becomes\nmost distinctly visible if one opposes obstacles to their action. For\nexample, the caterpillar spins itself in leaves without knowing the end;\nbut if we destroy the web it skilfully repairs it. Bees adapt their hive\nat the first to the existing circumstances, and subsequent misfortunes,\nsuch as intentional destruction, they meet in the way most suitable to the\nspecial case (Kirby and Spence, _Introduc. to Entomol._; Huber, _Des\nabeilles_). Such things excite our astonishment, because the apprehension\nof the circumstances and the adaptation to these is clearly a matter of\nknowledge; while we believe them capable once for all of the most\ningenious preparation for the coming race and the distant future, well\nknowing that in this they are not guided by knowledge, for a forethought\nof that kind proceeding from knowledge demands an activity of the brain\nrising to the level of reason. On the other hand, the intellect even of\nthe lower animals is sufficient for the modifying and arranging of the\nparticular case according to the existing or appearing circumstances;\nbecause, guided by instinct, it has only to fill up the gaps which this\nleaves. Thus we see ants carry off their larvæ whenever the place is too\ndamp, and bring them back again when it becomes dry. They do not know the\naim of this, thus are not guided in it by knowledge; but the choice of the\ntime at which the place is no longer suitable for the larvæ, and also of\nthe place to which they now bring them, is left to their knowledge. I wish\nhere also to mention a fact which some one related to me verbally from his\nown experience, though I have since found that Burdach quotes it from\nGleditsch. The latter, in order to test the burying‐beetle (_Necrophorus\nvespillo_), had tied a dead frog lying upon the ground to a string, the\nupper end of which was fastened to a stick stuck obliquely in the ground.\nNow after several burying‐beetles had, according to their custom,\nundermined the frog, it could not, as they expected, sink into the ground;\nafter much perplexed running hither and thither they undermined the stick\nalso. To this assistance rendered to instinct, and that repairing of the\nworks of mechanical tendency, we find in the organism the _healing power_\nof nature analogous, which not only heals wounds, replacing even bone and\nnerve substance, but, if through the injury of a vein or nerve branch a\nconnection is interrupted, opens a new connection by means of enlargement\nof other veins or nerves, nay, perhaps even by producing new branches;\nwhich further makes some other part or function take the place of a\ndiseased part or function; in the case of the loss of an eye sharpens the\nother, or in the case of the loss of one of the senses sharpens all the\nrest; which even sometimes closes an intestinal wound, in itself fatal, by\nthe adhesion of the mesentery or the peritoneum; in short, seeks to meet\nevery injury and every disturbance in the most ingenious manner. If, on\nthe other hand, the injury is quite incurable, it hastens to expedite\ndeath, and indeed the more so the higher is the species of the organism,\nthus the greater its sensibility. Even this has its analogue in the\ninstinct of insects. The wasps, for instance, who through the whole summer\nhave with great care and labour fed their larvæ on the produce of their\nplundering, but now, in October, see the last generation of them facing\nstarvation, sting them to death (Kirby and Spence, vol. i. p. 374). Nay,\nstill more curious and special analogies may be found; for example, this:\nif the female humble‐bee (_Apis terrestris, bombylius_) lays eggs, the\nworking humble‐bees are seized with a desire to devour them, which lasts\nfrom six to eight hours and is satisfied unless the mother keeps them off\nand carefully guards the eggs. But after this time the working humble‐bees\nshow absolutely no inclination to eat the eggs even when offered to them;\non the contrary, they now become the zealous tenders and nourishers of the\nlarvæ now being hatched out. This may without violence be taken as an\nanalogue of children’s complaints, especially teething, in which it is\njust the future nourishers of the organism making an attack upon it which\nso often costs it its life. The consideration of all these analogies\nbetween organised life and the instinct, together with the mechanical\ntendencies of the lower animals, serves ever more to confirm the\nconviction that the _will_ is the basis of the one as of the other, for it\nshows here also the subordinate rôle of knowledge in the action of the\nwill, sometimes more, sometimes less, confined, and sometimes wanting\naltogether.\n\nBut in yet another respect instincts and the animal organisation\nreciprocally illustrate each other: through the _anticipation of the\nfuture_ which appears in both. By means of instincts and mechanical\ntendencies animals care for the satisfaction of wants which they do not\nyet feel, nay, not only for their own wants, but even for those of the\nfuture brood. Thus they work for an end which is as yet unknown to them.\nThis goes so far, as I have illustrated by the example of the Bombex in\n“The Will in Nature” (second edit. p. 45, third edit. p. 47), that they\npursue and kill in advance the enemies of their future eggs. In the same\nway we see the future wants of an animal, its prospective ends,\nanticipated in its whole corporisation by the organised implements for\ntheir attainment and satisfaction; from which, then, proceeds that perfect\nadaptation of the structure of every animal to its manner of life, that\nequipment of it with the needful weapons to attack its prey and to ward\noff its enemies, and that calculation of its whole form with reference to\nthe element and the surroundings in which it has to appear as a pursuer,\nwhich I have fully described in my work on the will in nature under the\nrubric “Comparative Anatomy.” All these anticipations, both in the\ninstinct and in the organisation of animals, we might bring under the\nconception of a knowledge _a priori_, if _knowledge_ lay at their\nfoundation at all. But this is, as we have shown, not the case. Their\nsource lies deeper than the sphere of knowledge, in the will as the thing\nin itself, which as such remains free even from the _forms_ of knowledge;\ntherefore with reference to it time has no significance, consequently the\nfuture lies as near it as the present.\n\nChapter XXVIII.(6) Characterisation Of The Will To Live.\n\nOur second book closed with the question as to the goal and aim of that\nwill which had shown itself to be the inner nature of all things in the\nworld. The following remarks may serve to supplement the answer to this\nquestion given there in general terms, for they lay down the character of\nthe will as a whole.\n\nSuch a characterisation is possible because we have recognised as the\ninner nature of the world something thoroughly real and empirically given.\nOn the other hand, the very name “world‐soul,” by which many have denoted\nthat inner being, gives instead of this a mere _ens rationis_; for “soul”\nsignifies an individual unity of consciousness which clearly does not\nbelong to that nature, and in general, since the conception “soul”\nsupposes knowing and willing in inseparable connection and yet independent\nof the animal organism, it is not to be justified, and therefore not to be\nused. The word should never be applied except in a metaphorical sense, for\nit is much more insidious than ψυχη or anima, which signify breath.\n\nMuch more unsuitable, however, is the way in which so‐called pantheists\nexpress themselves, whose whole philosophy consists chiefly in this, that\nthey call the inner nature of the world, which is unknown to them, “God;”\nby which indeed they imagine they have achieved much. According to this,\nthen, the world would be a theophany. But let one only look at it: this\nworld of constantly needy creatures, who continue for a time only by\ndevouring one another, fulfil their existence in anxiety and want, and\noften suffer terrible miseries, till at last they fall into the arms of\ndeath; whoever distinctly looks upon this will allow that Aristotle was\nright in saying: “ἡ φυσις δαιομονια, αλλ᾽ ου θεια εστι” (_Natura dæmonia\nest, non divina_), _De divinat._, c. 2, p. 463; nay, he will be obliged to\nconfess that a God who could think of changing Himself into such a world\nas this must certainly have been tormented by the devil. I know well that\nthe pretended philosophers of this century follow Spinoza in this, and\nthink themselves thereby justified. But Spinoza had special reasons for\nthus naming his one substance, in order, namely, to preserve at least the\nword, although not the thing. The stake of Giordano Bruno and of Vanini\nwas still fresh in the memory; they also had been sacrificed to that God\nfor whose honour incomparably more human sacrifices have bled than on the\naltars of all heathen gods of both hemispheres together. If, then, Spinoza\ncalls the world God, it is exactly the same thing as when Rousseau in the\n“_Contrat social_,” constantly and throughout denotes the people by the\nword _le souverain_; we might also compare it with this, that once a\nprince who intended to abolish the nobility in his land, in order to rob\nno one of his own, hit upon the idea of ennobling all his subjects. Those\nphilosophers of our day have certainly one other ground for the\nnomenclature we are speaking of, but it is no more substantial. In their\nphilosophising they all start, not from the world or our consciousness of\nit, but from God, as something given and known; He is not their\n_quæsitum_, but their _datum_. If they were boys I would then explain to\nthem that this is a _petitio principii_, but they know this as well as I\ndo. But since Kant has shown that the path of the earlier dogmatism, which\nproceeded honestly, the path from the world to a God, does not lead there,\nthese gentlemen now imagine they have found a fine way of escape and made\nit cunningly. Will the reader of a later age pardon me for detaining him\nwith persons of whom he has never heard.\n\nEvery glance at the world, to explain which is the task of the\nphilosopher, confirms and proves that _will to live_, far from being an\narbitrary hypostasis or an empty word, is the only true expression of its\ninmost nature. Everything presses and strives towards _existence_, if\npossible _organised existence_, _i.e._, _life_, and after that to the\nhighest possible grade of it. In animal nature it then becomes apparent\nthat _will to live_ is the keynote of its being, its one unchangeable and\nunconditioned quality. Let any one consider this universal desire for\nlife, let him see the infinite willingness, facility, and exuberance with\nwhich the will to live presses impetuously into existence under a million\nforms everywhere and at every moment, by means of fructification and of\ngerms, nay, when these are wanting, by means of _generatio æquivoca_,\nseizing every opportunity, eagerly grasping for itself every material\ncapable of life: and then again let him cast a glance at its fearful alarm\nand wild rebellion when in any particular phenomenon it must pass out of\nexistence; especially when this takes place with distinct consciousness.\nThen it is precisely the same as if in this single phenomenon the whole\nworld would be annihilated for ever, and the whole being of this\nthreatened living thing is at once transformed into the most desperate\nstruggle against death and resistance to it. Look, for example, at the\nincredible anxiety of a man in danger of his life, the rapid and serious\nparticipation in this of every witness of it, and the boundless rejoicing\nat his deliverance. Look at the rigid terror with which a sentence of\ndeath is heard, the profound awe with which we regard the preparations for\ncarrying it out, and the heartrending compassion which seizes us at the\nexecution itself. We would then suppose there was something quite\ndifferent in question than a few less years of an empty, sad existence,\nembittered by troubles of every kind, and always uncertain: we would\nrather be amazed that it was a matter of any consequence whether one\nattained a few years earlier to the place where after an ephemeral\nexistence he has billions of years to be. In such phenomena, then, it\nbecomes visible that I am right in declaring that _the will to live_ is\nthat which cannot be further explained, but lies at the foundation of all\nexplanations, and that this, far from being an empty word, like the\nabsolute, the infinite, the idea, and similar expressions, is the most\nreal thing we know, nay, the kernel of reality itself.\n\nBut if now, abstracting for a while from this interpretation drawn from\nour inner being, we place ourselves as strangers over against nature, in\norder to comprehend it objectively, we find that from the grade of\norganised life upwards it has only one intention—that of the _maintenance\nof the species_. To this end it works, through the immense superfluity of\ngerms, through the urgent vehemence of the sexual instinct, through its\nwillingness to adapt itself to all circumstances and opportunities, even\nto the production of bastards, and through the instinctive maternal\naffection, the strength of which is so great that in many kinds of animals\nit even outweighs self‐love, so that the mother sacrifices her life in\norder to preserve that of the young. The individual, on the contrary, has\nfor nature only an indirect value, only so far as it is the means of\nmaintaining the species. Apart from this its existence is to nature a\nmatter of indifference; indeed nature even leads it to destruction as soon\nas it has ceased to be useful for this end. Why the individual exists\nwould thus be clear; but why does the species itself exist? That is a\nquestion which nature when considered merely objectively cannot answer.\nFor in vain do we seek by contemplating her for an end of this restless\nstriving, this ceaseless pressing into existence, this anxious care for\nthe maintenance of the species. The strength and time of the individuals\nare consumed in the effort to procure sustenance for themselves and their\nyoung, and are only just sufficient, sometimes even not sufficient, for\nthis. Even if here and there a surplus of strength, and therefore of\ncomfort—in the case of the _one_ rational species also of\nknowledge—remains, this is much too insignificant to pass for the end of\nthat whole process of nature. The whole thing, when regarded thus purely\nobjectively, and indeed as extraneous to us, looks as if nature was only\nconcerned that of all her (Platonic) _Ideas_, _i.e._, permanent forms,\nnone should be lost. Accordingly, as if she had so thoroughly satisfied\nherself with the fortunate discovery and combination of these Ideas (for\nwhich the three preceding occasions on which she stocked the earth’s\nsurface with animals were only the preparation), that now her only fear is\nlest any one of these beautiful fancies should be lost, _i.e._, lest any\none of these forms should disappear from time and the causal series. For\nthe individuals are fleeting as the water in the brook; the Ideas, on the\ncontrary, are permanent, like its eddies: but the exhaustion of the water\nwould also do away with the eddies. We would have to stop at this\nunintelligible view if nature were known to us only from without, thus\nwere given us merely _objectively_, and we accepted it as it is\ncomprehended by knowledge, and also as sprung from knowledge, _i.e._, in\nthe sphere of the idea, and were therefore obliged to confine ourselves to\nthis province in solving it. But the case is otherwise, and a glance at\nany rate is afforded us into the _interior of nature_; inasmuch as this is\nnothing else than _our own inner being_, which is precisely where nature,\narrived at the highest grade to which its striving could work itself up,\nis now by the light of knowledge found directly in self‐consciousness.\nHere the will shows itself to us as something _toto genere_ different from\nthe idea, in which nature appears unfolded in all her (Platonic) Ideas;\nand it now gives us, at one stroke, the explanation which could never be\nfound upon the objective path of the idea. Thus the subjective here gives\nthe key for the exposition of the objective. In order to recognise, as\nsomething original and unconditioned, that exceedingly strong tendency of\nall animals and men to retain life and carry it on as long as possible—a\ntendency which was set forth above as characteristic of the subjective, or\nof the will—it is necessary to make clear to ourselves that this is by no\nmeans the result of any objective _knowledge_ of the worth of life, but is\nindependent of all knowledge; or, in other words, that those beings\nexhibit themselves, not as drawn from in front, but as impelled from\nbehind.\n\nIf with this intention we first of all review the interminable series of\nanimals, consider the infinite variety of their forms, as they exhibit\nthemselves always differently modified according to their element and\nmanner of life, and also ponder the inimitable ingenuity of their\nstructure and mechanism, which is carried out with equal perfection in\nevery individual; and finally, if we take into consideration the\nincredible expenditure of strength, dexterity, prudence, and activity\nwhich every animal has ceaselessly to make through its whole life; if,\napproaching the matter more closely, we contemplate the untiring diligence\nof wretched little ants, the marvellous and ingenious industry of the\nbees, or observe how a single burying‐beetle (_Necrophorus vespillo_)\nburies a mole of forty times its own size in two days in order to deposit\nits eggs in it and insure nourishment for the future brood (_Gleditsch,\nPhysik. Bot. Œkon. Abhandl._, iii. 220), at the same time calling to mind\nhow the life of most insects is nothing but ceaseless labour to prepare\nfood and an abode for the future brood which will arise from their eggs,\nand which then, after they have consumed the food and passed through the\nchrysalis state, enter upon life merely to begin again from the beginning\nthe same labour; then also how, like this, the life of the birds is for\nthe most part taken up with their distant and laborious migrations, then\nwith the building of their nests and the collecting of food for the brood,\nwhich itself has to play the same rôle the following year; and so all work\nconstantly for the future, which afterwards makes bankrupt;—then we cannot\navoid looking round for the reward of all this skill and trouble, for the\nend which these animals have before their eyes, which strive so\nceaselessly—in short, we are driven to ask: What is the result? what is\nattained by the animal existence which demands such infinite preparation?\nAnd there is nothing to point to but the satisfaction of hunger and the\nsexual instinct, or in any case a little momentary comfort, as it falls to\nthe lot of each animal individual, now and then in the intervals of its\nendless need and struggle. If we place the two together, the indescribable\ningenuity of the preparations, the enormous abundance of the means, and\nthe insufficiency of what is thereby aimed at and attained, the insight\npresses itself upon us that life is a business, the proceeds of which are\nvery far from covering the cost of it. This becomes most evident in some\nanimals of a specially simple manner of life. Take, for example, the mole,\nthat unwearied worker. To dig with all its might with its enormous shovel\nclaws is the occupation of its whole life; constant night surrounds it;\nits embryo eyes only make it avoid the light. It alone is truly an _animal\nnocturnum_; not cats, owls, and bats, who see by night. But what, now,\ndoes it attain by this life, full of trouble and devoid of pleasure? Food\nand the begetting of its kind; thus only the means of carrying on and\nbeginning anew the same doleful course in new individuals. In such\nexamples it becomes clear that there is no proportion between the cares\nand troubles of life and the results or gain of it. The consciousness of\nthe world of perception gives a certain appearance of objective worth of\nexistence to the life of those animals which can see, although in their\ncase this consciousness is entirely subjective and limited to the\ninfluence of motives upon them. But the _blind_ mole, with its perfect\norganisation and ceaseless activity, limited to the alternation of insect\nlarvæ and hunger, makes the disproportion of the means to the end\napparent. In this respect the consideration of the animal world left to\nitself in lands uninhabited by men is also specially instructive. A\nbeautiful picture of this, and of the suffering which nature prepares for\nherself without the interference of man, is given by Humboldt in his\n“_Ansichten der Natur_” (second edition, p. 30 _et seq._); nor does he\nneglect to cast a glance (p. 44) at the analogous suffering of the human\nrace, always and everywhere at variance with itself. Yet in the simple and\neasily surveyed life of the brutes the emptiness and vanity of the\nstruggle of the whole phenomenon is more easily grasped. The variety of\nthe organisations, the ingenuity of the means, whereby each is adapted to\nits element and its prey contrasts here distinctly with the want of any\nlasting final aim; instead of which there presents itself only momentary\ncomfort, fleeting pleasure conditioned by wants, much and long suffering,\nconstant strife, _bellum omnium_, each one both a hunter and hunted,\npressure, want, need, and anxiety, shrieking and howling; and this goes on\n_in secula seculorum_, or till once again the crust of the planet breaks.\nYunghahn relates that he saw in Java a plain far as the eye could reach\nentirely covered with skeletons, and took it for a battlefield; they were,\nhowever, merely the skeletons of large turtles, five feet long and three\nfeet broad, and the same height, which come this way out of the sea in\norder to lay their eggs, and are then attacked by wild dogs (_Canis\nrutilans_), who with their united strength lay them on their backs, strip\noff their lower armour, that is, the small shell of the stomach, and so\ndevour them alive. But often then a tiger pounces upon the dogs. Now all\nthis misery repeats itself thousands and thousands of times, year out,\nyear in. For this, then, these turtles are born. For whose guilt must they\nsuffer this torment? Wherefore the whole scene of horror? To this the only\nanswer is: it is thus that the will to live objectifies itself.(7) Let one\nconsider it well and comprehend it in all its objectifications; and then\none will arrive at an understanding of its nature and of the world; but\nnot if one frames general conceptions and builds card houses out of them.\nThe comprehension of the great drama of the objectification of the will to\nlive, and the characterisation of its nature, certainly demands somewhat\nmore accurate consideration and greater thoroughness than the dismissal of\nthe world by attributing to it the title of God, or, with a silliness\nwhich only the German fatherland offers and knows how to enjoy, explaining\nit as the “Idea in its other being,” in which for twenty years the\nsimpletons of my time have found their unutterable delight. Certainly,\naccording to pantheism or Spinozism, of which the systems of our century\nare mere travesties, all that sort of thing reels itself off actually\nwithout end, straight on through all eternity. For then the world is a\nGod, _ens perfectissimum_, _i.e._, nothing better can be or be conceived.\nThus there is no need of deliverance from it; and consequently there is\nnone. But why the whole tragi‐comedy exists cannot in the least be seen;\nfor it has no spectators, and the actors themselves undergo infinite\ntrouble, with little and merely negative pleasure.\n\nLet us now add the consideration of the human race. The matter indeed\nbecomes more complicated, and assumes a certain seriousness of aspect; but\nthe fundamental character remains unaltered. Here also life presents\nitself by no means as a gift for enjoyment, but as a task, a drudgery to\nbe performed; and in accordance with this we see, in great and small,\nuniversal need, ceaseless cares, constant pressure, endless strife,\ncompulsory activity, with extreme exertion of all the powers of body and\nmind. Many millions, united into nations, strive for the common good, each\nindividual on account of his own; but many thousands fall as a sacrifice\nfor it. Now senseless delusions, now intriguing politics, incite them to\nwars with each other; then the sweat and the blood of the great multitude\nmust flow, to carry out the ideas of individuals, or to expiate their\nfaults. In peace industry and trade are active, inventions work miracles,\nseas are navigated, delicacies are collected from all ends of the world,\nthe waves engulf thousands. All strive, some planning, others acting; the\ntumult is indescribable. But the ultimate aim of it all, what is it? To\nsustain ephemeral and tormented individuals through a short span of time\nin the most fortunate case with endurable want and comparative freedom\nfrom pain, which, however, is at once attended with ennui; then the\nreproduction of this race and its striving. In this evident disproportion\nbetween the trouble and the reward, the will to live appears to us from\nthis point of view, if taken objectively, as a fool, or subjectively, as a\ndelusion, seized by which everything living works with the utmost exertion\nof its strength for something that is of no value. But when we consider it\nmore closely, we shall find here also that it is rather a blind pressure,\na tendency entirely without ground or motive.\n\nThe law of motivation, as was shown in § 29 of the first volume, only\nextends to the particular actions, not to willing _as a whole and in\ngeneral_. It depends upon this, that if we conceive of the human race and\nits action _as a whole and universally_, it does not present itself to us,\nas when we contemplate the particular actions, as a play of puppets who\nare pulled after the ordinary manner by threads outside them; but from\nthis point of view, as puppets which are set in motion by internal\nclockwork. For if, as we have done above, one compares the ceaseless,\nserious, and laborious striving of men with what they gain by it, nay,\neven with what they ever can gain, the disproportion we have pointed out\nbecomes apparent, for one recognises that that which is to be gained,\ntaken as the motive‐power, is entirely insufficient for the explanation of\nthat movement and that ceaseless striving. What, then, is a short\npostponement of death, a slight easing of misery or deferment of pain, a\nmomentary stilling of desire, compared with such an abundant and certain\nvictory over them all as death? What could such advantages accomplish\ntaken as actual moving causes of a human race, innumerable because\nconstantly renewed, which unceasingly moves, strives, struggles, grieves,\nwrithes, and performs the whole tragi‐comedy of the history of the world,\nnay, what says more than all, _perseveres_ in such a mock‐existence as\nlong as each one possibly can? Clearly this is all inexplicable if we seek\nthe moving causes outside the figures and conceive the human race as\nstriving, in consequence of rational reflection, or something analogous to\nthis (as moving threads), after those good things held out to it, the\nattainment of which would be a sufficient reward for its ceaseless cares\nand troubles. The matter being taken thus, every one would rather have\nlong ago said, “_Le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle_,” and have gone out.\nBut, on the contrary, every one guards and defends his life, like a\nprecious pledge intrusted to him under heavy responsibility, under\ninfinite cares and abundant misery, even under which life is tolerable.\nThe wherefore and the why, the reward for this, certainly he does not see;\nbut he has accepted the worth of that pledge without seeing it, upon trust\nand faith, and does not know what it consists in. Hence I have said that\nthese puppets are not pulled from without, but each bears in itself the\nclockwork from which its movements result. This is _the will to live_,\nmanifesting itself as an untiring machine, an irrational tendency, which\nhas not its sufficient reason in the external world. It holds the\nindividuals firmly upon the scene, and is the _primum mobile_ of their\nmovements; while the external objects, the motives, only determine their\ndirection in the particular case; otherwise the cause would not be at all\nsuitable to the effect. For, as every manifestation of a force of nature\nhas a cause, but the force of nature itself none, so every particular act\nof will has a motive, but the will in general has none: indeed at bottom\nthese two are one and the same. The will, as that which is metaphysical,\nis everywhere the boundary‐stone of every investigation, beyond which it\ncannot go. From the original and unconditioned nature of the will, which\nhas been proved, it is explicable that man loves beyond everything else an\nexistence full of misery, trouble, pain, and anxiety, and, again, full of\nennui, which, if he considered and weighed it purely objectively, he would\ncertainly abhor, and fears above all things the end of it, which is yet\nfor him the one thing certain.(8) Accordingly we often see a miserable\nfigure, deformed and shrunk with age, want, and disease, implore our help\nfrom the bottom of his heart for the prolongation of an existence, the end\nof which would necessarily appear altogether desirable if it were an\nobjective judgment that determined here. Thus instead of this it is the\nblind will, appearing as the tendency to life, the love of life, and the\nsense of life; it is the same which makes the plants grow. This sense of\nlife may be compared to a rope which is stretched above the puppet‐show of\nthe world of men, and on which the puppets hang by invisible threads,\nwhile apparently they are supported only by the ground beneath them (the\nobjective value of life). But if the rope becomes weak the puppet sinks;\nif it breaks the puppet must fall, for the ground beneath it only seemed\nto support it: _i.e._, the weakening of that love of life shows itself as\nhypochondria, spleen, melancholy: its entire exhaustion as the inclination\nto suicide, which now takes place on the slightest occasion, nay, for a\nmerely imaginary reason, for now, as it were, the man seeks a quarrel with\nhimself, in order to shoot himself dead, as many do with others for a like\npurpose;—indeed, upon necessity, suicide is resorted to without any\nspecial occasion. (Evidence of this will be found in Esquirol, _Des\nmaladies mentales_, 1838.) And as with the persistence in life, so is it\nalso with its action and movement. This is not something freely chosen;\nbut while every one would really gladly rest, want and ennui are the whips\nthat keep the top spinning. Therefore the whole and every individual bears\nthe stamp of a forced condition; and every one, in that, inwardly weary,\nhe longs for rest, but yet must press forward, is like his planet, which\ndoes not fall into the sun only because a force driving it forward\nprevents it. Therefore everything is in continual strain and forced\nmovement, and the course of the world goes on, to use an expression of\nAristotle’s (_De cœlo_, ii. 13), “ου φυσει, αλλα βιᾳ” (_Motu, non naturali\nsed violento_). Men are only apparently drawn from in front; really they\nare pushed from behind; it is not life that tempts them on, but necessity\nthat drives them forward. The law of motivation is, like all causality,\nmerely the form of the phenomenon. We may remark in passing that this is\nthe source of the comical, the burlesque, the grotesque, the ridiculous\nside of life; for, urged forward against his will, every one bears himself\nas best he can, and the straits that thus arise often look comical enough,\nserious as is the misery which underlies them.\n\nIn all these considerations, then, it becomes clear to us that the will to\nlive is not a consequence of the knowledge of life, is in no way a\n_conclusio ex præmissis_, and in general is nothing secondary. Rather, it\nis that which is first and unconditioned, the premiss of all premisses,\nand just on that account that from which philosophy must _start_, for the\nwill to live does not appear in consequence of the world, but the world in\nconsequence of the will to live.\n\nI scarcely need to draw attention to the fact that the considerations with\nwhich we now conclude the second book already point forcibly to the\nserious theme of the fourth book, indeed would pass over into it directly\nif it were not that my architectonic symmetry makes it necessary that the\nthird book, with its fair \n\nSUPPLEMENTS TO THE THIRD BOOK.\n\n    “_Et is similis spectatori est, quad ab omni separatus spectaculum\n    videt._”\n\n    —OUPNEKHAT, vol. i. p. 304.\n\nChapter XXIX.(9) On The Knowledge Of The Ideas.\n\nThe intellect, which has hitherto only been considered in its original and\nnatural condition of servitude under the will, appears in the third book\nin its deliverance from that bondage; with regard to which, however, it\nmust at once be observed that we have not to do here with a lasting\nemancipation, but only with a brief hour of rest, an exceptional and\nindeed only momentary release from the service of the will. As this\nsubject has been treated with sufficient fulness in the first volume, I\nhave here only to add a few supplementary remarks.\n\nAs, then, was there explained, the intellect in its activity in the\nservice of the will, thus in its natural function, knows only the mere\n_relations_ of things; primarily to the will itself, to which it belongs,\nwhereby they become motives of the will; but then also, just for the sake\nof the completeness of this knowledge, the relations of things to each\nother. This last knowledge first appears in some extent and importance in\nthe human intellect; in the case of the brutes, on the other hand, even\nwhere the intellect is considerably developed, only within very narrow\nlimits. Clearly even the apprehension of the relations which things have\nto each other only takes place, _indirectly_, in the service of the will.\nIt therefore forms the transition to the purely objective knowledge, which\nis entirely independent of the will; it is scientific knowledge, the\nlatter is artistic knowledge. If many and various relations of an object\nare immediately apprehended, from these the peculiar and proper nature of\nthe object appears ever more distinctly, and gradually constructs itself\nout of mere relations: although it itself is entirely different from them.\nIn this mode of apprehension the subjection of the intellect to the will\nat once becomes ever more indirect and less. If the intellect has strength\nenough to gain the preponderance, and let go altogether the relations of\nthings to the will, in order to apprehend, instead of them, the purely\nobjective nature of a phenomenon, which expresses itself through all\nrelations, it also forsakes, along with the service of the will, the\napprehension of mere relations, and thereby really also that of the\nindividual thing as such. It then moves freely, no longer belonging to a\nwill. In the individual thing it knows only the _essential_, and therefore\nits whole _species_; consequently it now has for its object the _Ideas_,\nin my sense, which agrees with the original, Platonic meaning of this\ngrossly misused word; thus the permanent, unchanging forms, independent of\nthe temporal existence of the individuals, the _species rerum_, which\nreally constitute what is purely objective in the phenomena. An Idea so\napprehended is not yet indeed the essence of the thing in itself, just\nbecause it has sprung from knowledge of mere relations; yet, as the result\nof the sum of all the relations, it is the peculiar _character_ of the\nthing, and thereby the complete expression of the essence which exhibits\nitself as an object of perception, comprehended, not in relation to an\nindividual will, but as it expresses itself spontaneously, whereby indeed\nit determines all its relations, which till then alone were known. The\nIdea is the root point of all these relations, and thereby the complete\nand perfect phenomenon, or, as I have expressed it in the text, the\nadequate objectivity of the will at this grade of its manifestation. Form\nand colour, indeed, which in the apprehension of the Idea by perception\nare what is immediate, belong at bottom not to the Idea itself, but are\nmerely the medium of its expression; for, strictly speaking, space is as\nforeign to it as time. In this sense the Neo‐Platonist Olympiodorus\nalready says in his commentary on Plato’s Alcibiades (Kreuzer’s edition of\nProclus and Olympiodorus, vol. ii. p. 82): “το ειδος μεταδεδωκε μεν της\nμορφης τῃ ὑλῃ αμερες δε ον μετελαβεν εξ αυτης του δεαστατου:” _i.e._, the\nIdea, in itself unextended, imparted certainly the form to the matter, but\nfirst assumed extension from it. Thus, as was said, the Ideas reveal not\nthe thing in itself, but only the objective character of things, thus\nstill only the phenomenon; and we would not even understand this character\nif the inner nature of things were not otherwise known to us at least\nobscurely and in feeling. This nature itself cannot be understood from the\nIdeas, nor in general through any merely _objective_ knowledge; therefore\nit would remain an eternal secret if we were not able to approach it from\nan entirely different side. Only because every knowing being is also an\nindividual, and thereby a part of nature, does the approach to the inner\nbeing of nature stand open to him in his own self‐consciousness, where, as\nwe have found, it makes itself known in the most immediate manner as will.\n\nNow what the Platonic Idea is, regarded as a merely objective image, mere\nform, and thereby lifted out of time and all relations—that, taken\nempirically and in time, is the _species_ or kind. This, then, is the\nempirical correlative of the Idea. The Idea is properly eternal, but the\nspecies is of endless duration, although its appearance upon one planet\nmay become extinct. Even the names of the two pass over into each other:\nιδεα, ειδος, _species_, kind. The Idea is the species, but not the genus:\ntherefore the _species_ are the work of nature, the _genera_ the work of\nman; they are mere conceptions. There are _species __ naturales_, but only\n_genera logica_. Of manufactured articles there are no Ideas, but only\nconceptions; thus _genera logica_, and their subordinate classes are\n_species logicæ_. To what is said in this reference in vol. i. § 41, I\nwill add here that Aristotle also (_Metaph._ i. 9 and xiii. 5) says that\nthe Platonists admitted no ideas of manufactured articles: “ὁιον οικια,\nκαι δακτυλιος, ὡν ου φασιν ειναι ειδη” (_Ut domus et annulus, quorum ideas\ndari negant_). With which compare the Scholiast, p. 562, 563 of the Berlin\nquarto edition. Aristotle further says (_Metaph._ xi. 3): “αλλ ειπερ\n(Supple., ειδῃ εστι) επι των φυσει (εστι) διο δη ου κακως ὁ Πλατων εφη,\nὁτι ειδη εστι ὁποσα φυσει” (_Si quidem ideæ sunt, in iis sunt, quæ natura\nfiunt: propter quod non male Plato dixit, quod species eorum sunt, quæ\nnatura sunt_). On which the Scholiast remarks, p. 800: “και τουτο αρεσκει\nκαι αυτοις τοις τας ιδεας θεμενοις; των γαρ ὑπο τεχνης γινομενων ιδεας\nειναι ουκ ελεγον, αλλα των ὑπο φυσεως” (_Hoc etiam ipsis ideas\nstatuentibus placet: non enim arte factorum ideas dari ajebant, sed natura\nprocreatorum_). For the rest, the doctrine of Ideas originated with the\nPythagoreans, unless we distrust the assertion of Plutarch in the book,\n_De placitis philosophorum_, L. i. c. 3.\n\nThe individual is rooted in the species, and time in eternity. And as\nevery individual is so only because it has the nature of its species in\nitself, so also it has only temporal existence because it is in eternity.\nIn the following book a special chapter is devoted to the life of the\nspecies.\n\nIn § 49 of the first volume I have sufficiently brought out the difference\nbetween the Idea and the conception. Their resemblance, on the other hand,\nrests upon the following ground: The original and essential unity of an\nIdea becomes broken up into the multiplicity of individual things through\nthe perception of the knowing individual, which is subject to sensuous and\ncerebral conditions. But that unity is then restored through the\nreflection of the reason, yet only _in abstracto_, as a concept,\n_universale_, which indeed is equal to the Idea in extension, but has\nassumed quite a different _form_, and has thereby lost its perceptible\nnature, and with this its thorough determinateness. In this sense (but in\nno other) we might, in the language of the Scholastics, describe the Ideas\nas _universalia ante rem_, the conceptions as _universalia post rem_.\nBetween the two stand the individual things, the knowledge of which is\npossessed also by the brutes. Without doubt the realism of the Scholastics\narose from the confusion of the Platonic Ideas, to which, since they are\nalso the species, an objective real being can certainly be attributed,\nwith the mere concepts to which the Realists now wished to attribute such\na being, and thereby called forth the victorious opposition of Nominalism.\n\nChapter XXX.(10) On The Pure Subject Of Knowledge.\n\nThe comprehension of an Idea, the entrance of it into our consciousness,\nis only possible by means of a change in us, which might also be regarded\nas an act of self‐denial; for it consists in this, that knowledge turns\naway altogether from our own will, thus now leaves out of sight entirely\nthe valuable pledge intrusted to it, and considers things as if they could\nnever concern the will at all. For thus alone does knowledge become a pure\nmirror of the objective nature of things. Knowledge conditioned in this\nway must lie at the foundation of every genuine work of art as its origin.\nThe change in the subject which is required for this cannot proceed from\nthe will, just because it consists in the elimination of all volition;\nthus it can be no act of the will, _i.e._, it cannot lie in our choice. On\nthe contrary, it springs only from a temporary preponderance of the\nintellect over the will, or, physiologically considered, from a strong\nexcitement of the perceptive faculty of the brain, without any excitement\nof the desires or emotions. To explain this somewhat more accurately I\nremind the reader that our consciousness has two sides; partly, it is a\nconsciousness of our _own selves_, which is the will; partly a\nconsciousness of other things, and as such primarily, knowledge, _through\nperception_, of the external world, the apprehension of objects. Now the\nmore one side of the whole consciousness comes to the front, the more the\nother side withdraws. Accordingly, the consciousness of _other things_,\nthus knowledge of perception, becomes the more perfect, _i.e._, the more\nobjective, the less we are conscious of ourselves at the time. Here exists\nan actual antagonism. The more we are conscious of the object, the less we\nare conscious of the subject; the more, on the other hand, the latter\noccupies our consciousness, the weaker and more imperfect is our\nperception of the external world. The state which is required for pure\nobjectivity of perception has partly permanent conditions in the\nperfection of the brain and the general physiological qualities favourable\nto its activity, partly temporary conditions, inasmuch as such a state is\nfavoured by all that increases the attention and heightens the\nsusceptibility of the cerebral nervous system, yet without exciting any\npassion. One must not think here of spirituous drinks or opium; what is\nrather required is a night of quiet sleep, a cold bath, and all that\nprocures for the brain activity an unforced predominance by quieting the\ncirculation and calming the passions. It is especially these natural means\nof furthering the cerebral nervous activity which bring it about,\ncertainly so much the better the more developed and energetic in general\nthe brain is, that the object separates itself ever more from the subject,\nand finally introduces the state of pure objectivity of perception, which\nof itself eliminates the will from consciousness, and in which all things\nstand before us with increased clearness and distinctness, so that we are\nconscious almost only of them and scarcely at all of ourselves; thus our\nwhole consciousness is almost nothing more than the medium through which\nthe perceived object appears in the world as an idea. Thus it is necessary\nfor pure, will‐less knowledge that the consciousness of ourselves should\nvanish, since the consciousness of other things is raised to such a pitch.\nFor we only apprehend the world in a purely objective manner when we no\nlonger know that we belong to it; and all things appear the more beautiful\nthe more we are conscious merely of them and the less we are conscious of\nourselves. Since now all suffering proceeds from the will, which\nconstitutes the real self, with the withdrawal of this side of\nconsciousness all possibility of suffering is also abolished; therefore\nthe condition of the pure objectivity of perception is one which\nthroughout gives pleasure; and hence I have shown that in it lies one of\nthe two constituent elements of æsthetic satisfaction. As soon, on the\nother hand, as the consciousness of our own self, thus subjectivity,\n_i.e._, the will, again obtains the upper hand, a proportional degree of\ndiscomfort or unrest also enters; of discomfort, because our corporealness\n(the organism which in itself is the will) is again felt; of unrest,\nbecause the will, on the path of thought, again fills the consciousness\nthrough wishes, emotions, passions, and cares. For the will, as the\nprinciple of subjectivity, is everywhere the opposite, nay, the antagonist\nof knowledge. The greatest concentration of subjectivity consists in the\n_act of will_ proper, in which therefore we have the most distinct\nconsciousness of our own self. All other excitements of the will are only\npreparations for this; the act of will itself is for subjectivity what for\nthe electric apparatus is the passing of the spark. Every bodily sensation\nis in itself an excitement of the will, and indeed oftener of the\n_noluntas_ than of the _voluntas_. The excitement of the will on the path\nof thought is that which occurs by means of motives; thus here the\nsubjectivity is awakened and set in play by the objectivity itself. This\ntakes place whenever any object is apprehended no longer in a purely\nobjective manner, thus without participation in it, but, directly or\nindirectly, excites desire or aversion, even if it is only by means of a\nrecollection, for then it acts as a motive in the widest sense of the\nword.\n\nI remark here that abstract thinking and reading, which are connected with\nwords, belong indeed in the wider sense to the consciousness _of other\nthings_, thus to the objective employment of the mind; yet only\nindirectly, by means of conceptions. But the latter are the artificial\nproduct of the reason, and are therefore already a work of intention.\nMoreover, the will is the ruler of all abstract exercise of the mind, for,\naccording to its aims, it imparts the direction, and also fixes the\nattention; therefore such mental activity is always accompanied by some\neffort; and this presupposes the activity of the will. Thus complete\nobjectivity of consciousness does not exist with this kind of mental\nactivity, as it accompanies the æsthetic apprehension, _i.e._, the\nknowledge of the Ideas, as a condition.\n\nIn accordance with the above, the pure objectivity of perception, by\nvirtue of which no longer the individual thing as such, but the Idea of\nits species is known, is conditioned by the fact that one is no longer\nconscious of oneself, but only of the perceived objects, so that one’s own\nconsciousness only remains as the supporter of the objective existence of\nthese objects. What increases the difficulty of this state, and therefore\nmakes it more rare, is, that in it the accident (the intellect) overcomes\nand annuls the substance (the will), although only for a short time. Here\nalso lies the analogy and, indeed, the relationship of this with the\ndenial of the will expounded at the end of the following book. Although\nknowledge, as was shown in the preceding book, is sprung from the will and\nis rooted in the manifestation of the will, the organism, yet it is just\nby the will that its purity is disturbed, as the flame is by the fuel and\nits smoke. It depends upon this that we can only apprehend the purely\nobjective nature of things, the Ideas which appear in them, when we have\nourselves no interest in them, because they stand in no relation to our\nwill. From this, again, it arises that the Ideas of anything appeal to us\nmore easily from a work of art than from reality. For what we behold only\nin a picture or in poetry stands outside all possibility of having any\nrelation to our will; for in itself it exists only for knowledge and\nappeals immediately to knowledge alone. On the other hand, the\napprehension of Ideas from reality assumes some measure of abstraction\nfrom our own volition, arising above its interests which demands a special\npower of the intellect. In a high degree, and for some duration, this\nbelongs only to genius, which consists indeed in this, that a greater\nmeasure of the power of knowledge exists than is required for the service\nof an individual will, and this surplus becomes free, and now comprehends\nthe world without reference to the will. Thus that the work of art\nfacilitates so greatly the apprehension of the Ideas, in which æsthetic\nsatisfaction consists, depends not merely upon the fact that art, by\ngiving prominence to what is essential and eliminating what is\nunessential, presents the things more distinctly and characteristically,\nbut just as much on the fact that the absolute silence of the will, which\nis demanded for the purely objective comprehension of the nature of the\nthings, is attained with the greatest certainty when the perceived object\nitself lies entirely outside the province of things which are capable of\nhaving a relation to the will, because it is nothing real, but a mere\npicture. Now this holds good, not only of the works of plastic and\npictorial art, but also of poetry; the effect of which is also conditioned\nby indifferent, will‐less, and thereby purely objective apprehension. It\nis exactly this which makes a perceived object _picturesque_, an event of\nactual life _poetical_; for it is only this that throws over the objects\nof the real world that magic gleam which in the case of sensibly perceived\nobjects is called the picturesque, and in the case of those which are only\nperceived in imagination is called the poetical. If poets sing of the\nblithe morning, the beautiful evening, the still moonlight night, and many\nsuch things, the real object of their praise is, unknown to themselves,\nthe pure subject of knowledge which is called forth by those beauties of\nnature, and on the appearance of which the will vanishes from\nconsciousness, and so that peace of heart enters which, apart from this,\nis unattainable in the world. How otherwise, for example, could the verse—\n\n    “_Nox erat, at cœlo fulgebat luna sereno,_\n          _Inter minora sidera_,”\n\naffect us so beneficently, nay, so magically? Further, that the stranger\nor the mere passing traveller feels the picturesque or poetical effect of\nobjects which are unable to produce this effect upon those who live among\nthem may be explained from the fact that the novelty and complete\nstrangeness of the objects of such an indifferent, purely objective\napprehension are favourable to it. Thus, for example, the sight of an\nentirely strange town often makes a specially agreeable impression upon\nthe traveller, which it by no means produces in the inhabitant of it; for\nit arises from the fact that the former, being out of all relation to this\ntown and its inhabitants, perceives it purely objectively. Upon this\ndepends partly the pleasure of travelling. This seems also to be the\nreason why it is sought to increase the effect of narrative or dramatic\nworks by transferring the scene to distant times or lands: in Germany, to\nItaly or Spain; in Italy, to Germany, Poland, or even Holland. If now\nperfectly objective, intuitive apprehension, purified from all volition,\nis the condition of the _enjoyment_ of æsthetic objects, so much the more\nis it the condition of their _production_. Every good picture, every\ngenuine poem, bears the stamp of the frame of mind described. For only\nwhat has sprung from perception, and indeed from purely objective\nperception, or is directly excited by it, contains the living germ from\nwhich genuine and original achievements can grow up: not only in plastic\nand pictorial art, but also in poetry, nay, even in philosophy. The\n_punctum saliens_ of every beautiful work, of every great or profound\nthought, is a purely objective perception. Such perception, however, is\nabsolutely conditioned by the complete silence of the will, which leaves\nthe man simply the pure subject of knowledge. The natural disposition for\nthe predominance of this state is genius.\n\nWith the disappearance of volition from consciousness, the individuality\nalso, and with it its suffering and misery, is really abolished. Therefore\nI have described the pure subject of knowledge which then remains over as\nthe eternal eye of the world, which, although with very different degrees\nof clearness, looks forth from all living creatures, untouched by their\nappearing and passing away, and thus, as identical with itself, as\nconstantly one and the same, is the supporter of the world of permanent\nIdeas, _i.e._, of the adequate objectivity of the will; while the\nindividual subject, whose knowledge is clouded by the individuality which\nsprings from the will, has only particular things as its object, and is\ntransitory as these themselves. In the sense here indicated a double\nexistence may be attributed to every one. As will, and therefore as\nindividual, he is only one, and this one exclusively, which gives him\nenough to do and to suffer. As the purely objective perceiver, he is the\npure subject of knowledge in whose consciousness alone the objective world\nhas its existence; as such he is _all things_ so far as he perceives them.\nand in him is their existence without burden or inconvenience. It is _his_\nexistence, so far as it exists in _his_ idea; but it is there without\nwill. So far, on the other hand, as it is will, it is not in him. It is\nwell with every one when he is in that state in which he is all things; it\nis ill with him when in the state in which he is exclusively one. Every\nstate, every man, every scene of life, requires only to be purely\nobjectively apprehended and be made the subject of a sketch, whether with\npencil or with words, in order to appear interesting, charming, and\nenviable; but if one is in it, if one is it oneself, then (it is often a\ncase of) may the devil endure it. Therefore Goethe says—\n\n    “What in life doth only grieve us,\n    That in art we gladly see.”\n\nThere was a period in the years of my youth when I was always trying to\nsee myself and my action from without, and picture it to myself; probably\nin order to make it more enjoyable to me.\n\nAs I have never spoken before on the subject I have just been considering,\nI wish to add a psychological illustration of it.\n\nIn the immediate perception of the world and of life we consider things,\nas a rule, merely in their relations, consequently according to their\nrelative and not their absolute nature and existence. For example, we will\nregard houses, ships, machines, and the like with the thought of their end\nand their adaptation to it; men, with the thought of their relation to us,\nif they have any such; and then with that of their relations to each\nother, whether in their present action or with regard to their position\nand business, judging perhaps their fitness for it, &c. Such a\nconsideration of the relations we can follow more or less far to the most\ndistant links of their chain: the consideration will thereby gain in\naccuracy and extent, but in its quality and nature it remains the same. It\nis the consideration of things in their relations, nay, _by means of\nthese_, thus according to the principle of sufficient reason. Every one,\nfor the most part and as a rule, is given up to this method of\nconsideration; indeed I believe that most men are capable of no other. But\nif, as an exception, it happens that we experience a momentary heightening\nof the intensity of our intuitive intelligence, we at once see things with\nentirely different eyes, in that we now apprehend them no longer according\nto their relations, but according to that which they are in and for\nthemselves, and suddenly perceive their absolute existence apart from\ntheir relative existence. At once every individual represents its species;\nand accordingly we now apprehend the universal of every being. Now what we\nthus know are the _Ideas of things_; but out of these there now speaks a\nhigher wisdom than that which knows of mere relations. And we also have\nthen passed out of the relations, and have thus become the pure subject of\nknowledge. But what now exceptionally brings about this state must be\ninternal physiological processes, which purify the activity of the brain,\nand heighten it to such a degree that a sudden spring‐tide of activity\nlike this ensues. The external conditions of this are that we remain\ncompletely strange to the scene to be considered, and separated from it,\nand are absolutely not actively involved in it.\n\nIn order to see that a purely objective, and therefore correct,\ncomprehension of things is only possible when we consider them without any\npersonal participation in them, thus when the will is perfectly silent,\nlet one call to mind how much every emotion or passion disturbs and\nfalsifies our knowledge, indeed how every inclination and aversion alters,\ncolours, and distorts not only the judgment, but even the original\nperception of things. Let one remember how when we are gladdened by some\nfortunate occurrence the whole world at once assumes a bright colour and a\nsmiling aspect, and, on the contrary, looks gloomy and sad when we are\npressed with cares; also, how even a lifeless thing, if it is to be made\nuse of in doing something which we abhor, seems to have a hideous\nphysiognomy; for example, the scaffold, the fortress, to which we have\nbeen brought, the surgeon’s cases of instruments; the travelling carriage\nof our loved one, &c., nay, numbers, letters, seals, may seem to grin upon\nus horribly and affect us as fearful monstrosities. On the other hand, the\ntools for the accomplishment of our wishes at once appear to us agreeable\nand pleasing; for example, the hump‐backed old woman with the love‐letter,\nthe Jew with the louis d’ors, the rope‐ladder to escape by, &c. As now\nhere the falsification of the idea through the will in the case of special\nabhorrence or love is unmistakable, so is it present in a less degree in\nevery object which has any even distant relation to our will, that is, to\nour desire or aversion. Only when the will with its interests has left\nconsciousness, and the intellect freely follows its own laws, and as pure\nsubject mirrors the objective world, yet in doing so, although spurred on\nby no volition, is of its own inclination in the highest state of tension\nand activity, do the colours and forms of things appear in their true and\nfull significance. Thus it is from such comprehension alone that genuine\nworks of art can proceed whose permanent worth and ever renewed approval\narises simply from the fact that they express the purely objective\nelement, which lies at the foundation of and shines through the different\nsubjective, and therefore distorted, perceptions, as that which is common\nto them all and alone stands fast; as it were the common theme of all\nthose subjective variations. For certainly the nature which is displayed\nbefore our eyes exhibits itself very differently in different minds; and\nas each one sees it so alone can he repeat it, whether with the pencil or\nthe chisel, or with words and gestures on the stage. Objectivity alone\nmakes one capable of being an artist; but objectivity is only possible in\nthis way, that the intellect, separated from its root the will, moves\nfreely, and yet acts with the highest degree of energy.\n\nTo the youth whose perceptive intellect still acts with fresh energy\nnature often exhibits itself with complete objectivity, and therefore with\nperfect beauty. But the pleasure of such a glance is sometimes disturbed\nby the saddening reflection that the objects present which exhibit\nthemselves in such beauty do not stand in a personal relation to this\nwill, by virtue of which they could interest and delight him; he expects\nhis life in the form of an interesting romance. “Behind that jutting cliff\nthe well‐mounted band of friends should await me,—beside that waterfall my\nlove should rest; this beautifully lighted building should be her\ndwelling, and that vine‐clad window hers;—but this beautiful world is for\nme a desert!” and so on. Such melancholy youthful reveries really demand\nsomething exactly contradictory to themselves; for the beauty with which\nthose objects present themselves depends just upon the pure objectivity,\n_i.e._, disinterestedness of their perception, and would therefore at once\nbe abolished by the relation to his own will which the youth painfully\nmisses, and thus the whole charm which now affords him pleasure, even\nthough alloyed with a certain admixture of pain, would cease to exist. The\nsame holds good, moreover, of every age and every relation; the beauty of\nthe objects of a landscape which now delights us would vanish if we stood\nin personal relations to them, of which we remained always conscious.\nEverything is beautiful only so long as it does not concern us. (We are\nnot speaking here of sensual passion, but of æsthetic pleasure.) Life is\nnever beautiful, but only the pictures of life are so in the transfiguring\nmirror of art or poetry; especially in youth, when we do not yet know it.\nMany a youth would receive great peace of mind if one could assist him to\nthis knowledge.\n\nWhy has the sight of the full moon such a beneficent, quieting, and\nexalting effect? Because the moon is an object of perception, but never of\ndesire:\n\n    “The stars we yearn not after\n    Delight us with their glory.”—G.\n\nFurther, it is sublime, _i.e._, it induces a lofty mood in us, because,\nwithout any relation to us, it moves along for ever strange to earthly\ndoings, and sees all while it takes part in nothing. Therefore, at the\nsight of it the will, with its constant neediness, vanishes from\nconsciousness, and leaves a purely knowing consciousness behind. Perhaps\nthere is also mingled here a feeling that we share this sight with\nmillions, whose individual differences are therein extinguished, so that\nin this perception they are one, which certainly increases the impression\nof the sublime. Finally, this is also furthered by the fact that the moon\nlights without heating, in which certainly lies the reason why it has been\ncalled chaste and identified with Diana. In consequence of this whole\nbeneficent impression upon our feeling, the moon becomes gradually our\nbosom friend. The sun, again, never does so; but is like an over‐plenteous\nbenefactor whom we can never look in the face.\n\nThe following remark may find room here as an addition to what is said in\n§ 38 of the first volume on the æsthetic pleasure afforded by light,\nreflection, and colours. The whole immediate, thoughtless, but also\nunspeakable, pleasure which is excited in us by the impression of colours,\nstrengthened by the gleam of metal, and still more by transparency, as,\nfor example, in coloured windows, and in a greater measure by means of the\nclouds and their reflection at sunset,—ultimately depends upon the fact\nthat here in the easiest manner, almost by a physical necessity, our whole\ninterest is won for knowledge, without any excitement of our will, so that\nwe enter the state of pure knowing, although for the most part this\nconsists here in a mere sensation of the affection of the retina, which,\nhowever, as it is in itself perfectly free from pain or pleasure, and\ntherefore entirely without direct influence on the will, thus belongs to\npure knowledge.\n\nChapter XXXI.(11) On Genius.\n\nWhat is properly denoted by the name genius is the predominating capacity\nfor that kind of knowledge which has been described in the two preceding\nchapters, the knowledge from which all genuine works of art and poetry,\nand even of philosophy, proceed. Accordingly, since this has for its\nobjects the Platonic Ideas, and these are not comprehended in the\nabstract, but _only perceptibly_, the essence of genius must lie in the\nperfection and energy of the knowledge of _perception_. Corresponding to\nthis, the works which we hear most decidedly designated works of genius\nare those which start immediately from perception and devote themselves to\nperception; thus those of plastic and pictorial art, and then those of\npoetry, which gets its perceptions by the assistance of the imagination.\nThe difference between genius and mere talent makes itself noticeable even\nhere. For talent is an excellence which lies rather in the greater\nversatility and acuteness of discursive than of intuitive knowledge. He\nwho is endowed with talent thinks more quickly and more correctly than\nothers; but the genius beholds another world from them all, although only\nbecause he has a more profound perception of the world which lies before\nthem also, in that it presents itself in his mind more objectively, and\nconsequently in greater purity and distinctness.\n\nThe intellect is, according to its destination, merely the medium of\nmotives; and in accordance with this it originally comprehends nothing in\nthings but their relations to the will, the direct, the indirect, and the\npossible. In the case of the brutes, where it is almost entirely confined\nto the direct relations, the matter is just on that account most apparent:\nwhat has no relation to their will does not exist for them. Therefore we\nsometimes see with surprise that even clever animals do not observe at all\nsomething conspicuous to them; for example, they show no surprise at\nobvious alterations in our person and surroundings. In the case of normal\nmen the indirect, and even the possible, relations to the will are added,\nthe sum of which make up the total of useful knowledge; but here also\nknowledge remains confined to the relations. Therefore the normal mind\ndoes not attain to an absolutely pure, objective picture of things,\nbecause its power of perception, whenever it is not spurred on by the will\nand set in motion, at once becomes tired and inactive, because it has not\nenough energy of its own elasticity and without an end in view to\napprehend the world in a purely objective manner. Where, on the other\nhand, this takes place—where the brain has such a surplus of the power of\nideation that a pure, distinct, objective image of the external world\nexhibits itself _without any aim_; an image which is useless for the\nintentions of the will, indeed, in the higher degrees, disturbing, and\neven injurious to them—there, the natural disposition, at least, is\nalready present for that abnormity which the name genius denotes, which\nsignifies that here a _genius_ foreign to the will, _i.e._, to the I\nproper, as it were coming from without, seems to be active. But to speak\nwithout a figure: genius consists in this, that the knowing faculty has\nreceived a considerably greater development than the _service of the\nwill_, for which alone it originally appeared, demands. Therefore,\nstrictly speaking, physiology might to a certain extent class such a\nsuperfluity of brain activity, and with it of brain itself, among the\n_monstra per excessum_, which, it is well known, it co‐ordinates with\n_monstra per defectum_ and those _per situm mutatum_. Thus genius consists\nin an abnormally large measure of intellect, which can only find its use\nby being applied to the universal of existence, whereby it then devotes\nitself to the service of the whole human race, as the normal intellect to\nthat of the individual. In order to make this perfectly comprehensible one\nmight say: if the normal man consists of two‐thirds will and one‐third\nintellect, the genius, on the contrary, has two‐thirds intellect and one‐\nthird will. This might, then, be further illustrated by a chemical simile:\nthe base and the acid of a neutral salt are distinguished by the fact that\nin each of the two the radical has the converse relation to oxygen to that\nwhich it has in the other. The base or the alkali is so because in it the\nradical predominates with reference to oxygen, and the acid is so because\nin it oxygen predominates. In the same way now the normal man and the\ngenius are related in respect of will and intellect. From this arises a\nthorough distinction between them, which is visible even in their whole\nnature and behaviour, but comes out most clearly in their achievements.\nOne might add the difference that while that total opposition between the\nchemical materials forms the strongest affinity and attraction between\nthem, in the human race the opposite is rather wont to be found.\n\nThe first manifestation which such a superfluity of the power of knowledge\ncalls forth shows itself for the most part in the most original and\nfundamental knowledge, _i.e._, in knowledge of _perception_, and occasions\nthe repetition of it in an image; hence arises the painter and the\nsculptor. In their case, then, the path between the apprehension of genius\nand the artistic production is the shortest; therefore the form in which\ngenius and its activity here exhibits itself is the simplest and its\ndescription the easiest. Yet here also the source is shown from which all\ngenuine productions in every art, in poetry, and indeed in philosophy,\nhave their origin, although in the case of these the process is not so\nsimple.\n\nLet the result arrived at in the first book be here borne in mind, that\nall perception is intellectual and not merely sensuous. If one now adds\nthe exposition given here, and, at the same time, in justice considers\nthat the philosophy of last century denoted the perceptive faculty of\nknowledge by the name “lower powers of the soul,” we will not think it so\nutterly absurd nor so deserving of the bitter scorn with which Jean Paul\nquotes it in his “_Vorschule der Æsthetik_,” that Adelung, who had to\nspeak the language of his age, placed genius in “a remarkable strength of\nthe lower powers of the soul.” The work just referred to of this author,\nwho is so worthy of our admiration, has great excellences, but yet I must\nremark that all through, whenever a theoretical explanation and, in\ngeneral, instruction is the end in view, a style of exposition which is\nconstantly indulging in displays of wit and hurrying along in mere similes\ncannot be well adapted to the purpose.\n\nIt is, then, _perception_ to which primarily the peculiar and true nature\nof things, although still in a conditioned manner, discloses and reveals\nitself. All conceptions and everything thought are mere abstractions,\nconsequently partial ideas taken from perception, and have only arisen by\nthinking away. All profound knowledge, even wisdom properly so called, is\nrooted in the _perceptive_ apprehension of things, as we have fully\nconsidered in the supplements to the first book. A _perceptive_\napprehension has always been the generative process in which every genuine\nwork of art, every immortal thought, received the spark of life. All\nprimary thought takes place in pictures. From conceptions, on the other\nhand, arise the works of mere talent, the merely rational thoughts,\nimitations, and indeed all that is calculated merely with reference to the\npresent need and contemporary conditions.\n\nBut if now our perception were constantly bound to the real present of\nthings, its material would be entirely under the dominion of chance, which\nseldom produces things at the right time, seldom arranges them for an end\nand for the most part presents them to us in very defective examples.\nTherefore the _imagination_ is required in order to complete, arrange,\ngive the finishing touches to, retain, and repeat at pleasure all those\nsignificant pictures of life, according as the aims of a profoundly\npenetrating knowledge and of the significant work whereby they are to be\ncommunicated may demand. Upon this rests the high value of imagination,\nwhich is an indispensable tool of genius. For only by virtue of\nimagination can genius ever, according to the requirements of the\nconnection of its painting or poetry or thinking, call up to itself each\nobject or event in a lively image, and thus constantly draw fresh\nnourishment from the primary source of all knowledge, perception. The man\nwho is endowed with imagination is able, as it were, to call up spirits,\nwho at the right time reveal to him the truths which the naked reality of\nthings exhibits only weakly, rarely, and then for the most part at the\nwrong time. Therefore the man without imagination is related to him, as\nthe mussel fastened to its rock, which must wait for what chance may bring\nit, is related to the freely moving or even winged animal. For such a man\nknows nothing but the actual perception of the senses: till it comes he\ngnaws at conceptions and abstractions which are yet mere shells and husks,\nnot the kernel of knowledge. He will never achieve anything great, unless\nit be in calculating and mathematics. The works of plastic and pictorial\nart and of poetry, as also the achievements of mimicry, may also be\nregarded as means by which those who have no imagination may make up for\nthis defect as far as possible, and those who are gifted with it may\nfacilitate the use of it.\n\nThus, although the kind of knowledge which is peculiar and essential to\ngenius is knowledge of _perception_, yet the special object of this\nknowledge by no means consists of the particular things, but of the\nPlatonic Ideas which manifest themselves in these, as their apprehension\nwas analysed in chapter 29. Always to see the universal in the particular\nis just the fundamental characteristic of genius, while the normal man\nknows in the particular only the particular as such, for only as such does\nit belong to the actual which alone has interests for him, _i.e._,\nrelations to his _will_. The degree in which every one not merely thinks,\nbut actually perceives, in the particular thing, only the particular, or a\nmore or less universal up to the most universal of the species, is the\nmeasure of his approach to genius. And corresponding to this, only the\nnature of things generally, the universal in them, the whole, is the\nspecial object of genius. The investigation of the particular phenomena is\nthe field of the talents, in the real sciences, whose special object is\nalways only the relations of things to each other.\n\nWhat was fully shown in the preceding chapter, that the apprehension of\nthe Ideas is conditioned by the fact that the knower is the _pure subject_\nof knowledge, _i.e._, that the will entirely vanishes from consciousness,\nmust be borne in mind here. The pleasure which we have in many of Goethe’s\nsongs which bring the landscape before our eyes, or in Jean Paul’s\nsketches of nature, depends upon the fact that we thereby participate in\nthe objectivity of those minds, _i.e._, the purity with which in them the\nworld as idea separated from the world as will, and, as it were, entirely\nemancipated itself from it. It also follows from the fact that the kind of\nknowledge peculiar to genius is essentially that which is purified from\nall will and its relations, that the works of genius do not proceed from\nintention or choice, but it is guided in them by a kind of instinctive\nnecessity. What is called the awaking of genius, the hour of initiation,\nthe moment of inspiration, is nothing but the attainment of freedom by the\nintellect, when, delivered for a while from its service under the will, it\ndoes not now sink into inactivity or lassitude, but is active for a short\ntime entirely alone and spontaneously. Then it is of the greatest purity,\nand becomes the clear mirror of the world; for, completely severed from\nits origin, the will, it is now the world as idea itself, concentrated in\n_one_ consciousness. In such moments, as it were, the souls of immortal\nworks are begotten. On the other hand, in all intentional reflection the\nintellect is not free, for indeed the will guides it and prescribes it its\ntheme.\n\nThe stamp of commonness, the expression of vulgarity, which is impressed\non the great majority of countenances consists really in this, that in\nthem becomes visible the strict subordination of their knowledge to their\nwill, the firm chain which binds these two together, and the impossibility\nfollowing from this of apprehending things otherwise than in their\nrelation to the will and its aims. On the other hand, the expression of\ngenius which constitutes the evident family likeness of all highly gifted\nmen consists in this, that in it we distinctly read the liberation, the\nmanumission of the intellect from the service of the will, the\npredominance of knowledge over volition; and because all anxiety proceeds\nfrom the will, and knowledge, on the contrary, is in and for itself\npainless and serene, this gives to their lofty brow and clear, perceiving\nglance, which are not subject to the service of the will and its wants,\nthat look of great, almost supernatural serenity which at times breaks\nthrough, and consists very well with the melancholy of their other\nfeatures, especially the mouth, and which in this relation may be aptly\ndescribed by the motto of Giordano Bruno: _In tristitia hilaris, in\nhilaritate tristis_.\n\nThe will, which is the root of the intellect, opposes itself to any\nactivity of the latter which is directed to anything else but its own\naims. Therefore the intellect is only capable of a purely objective and\nprofound comprehension of the external world when it has freed itself at\nleast for a while from this its root. So long as it remains bound to the\nwill, it is of its own means capable of no activity, but sleeps in a\nstupor, whenever the will (the interests) does not awake it, and set it in\nmotion. If, however, this happens, it is indeed very well fitted to\nrecognise the relations of things according to the interest of the will,\nas the prudent mind does, which, however, must always be an awakened mind,\n_i.e._, a mind actively aroused by volition; but just on this account it\nis not capable of comprehending the purely objective nature of things. For\nthe willing and the aims make it so one‐sided that it sees in things only\nthat which relates to these, and the rest either disappears or enters\nconsciousness in a falsified form. For example, the traveller in anxiety\nand haste will see the Rhine and its banks only as a line, and the bridges\nover it only as lines cutting it. In the mind of the man who is filled\nwith his own aims the world appears as a beautiful landscape appears on\nthe plan of a battlefield. Certainly these are extremes, taken for the\nsake of distinctness; but every excitement of the will, however slight,\nwill have as its consequence a slight but constantly proportionate\nfalsification of knowledge. The world can only appear in its true colour\nand form, in its whole and correct significance, when the intellect,\ndevoid of willing, moves freely over the objects, and without being driven\non by the will is yet energetically active. This is certainly opposed to\nthe nature and determination of the intellect, thus to a certain extent\nunnatural, and just on this account exceedingly rare; but it is just in\nthis that the essential nature of genius lies, in which alone that\ncondition takes place in a high degree and is of some duration, while in\nothers it only appears approximately and exceptionally. I take it to be in\nthe sense expounded here that Jean Paul (_Vorschule der Æsthetik_, § 12)\nplaces the essence of genius in _reflectiveness_. The normal man is sunk\nin the whirl and tumult of life, to which he belongs through his will; his\nintellect is filled with the things and events of life; but he does not\nknow these things nor life itself in their objective significance; as the\nmerchant on ’Change in Amsterdam apprehends perfectly what his neighbour\nsays, but does not hear the hum of the whole Exchange, like the sound of\nthe sea, which astonishes the distant observer. From the genius, on the\ncontrary, whose intellect is delivered from the will, and thus from the\nperson, what concerns these does not conceal the world and things\nthemselves; but he becomes distinctly conscious of them, he apprehends\nthem in and for themselves in objective perception; in this sense he is\n_reflective_.\n\nIt is _reflectiveness_ which enables the painter to repeat the natural\nobjects which he contemplates faithfully upon the canvas, and the poet\naccurately to call up again the concrete present, by means of abstract\nconceptions, by giving it utterance and so bringing it to distinct\nconsciousness, and also to express everything in words which others only\nfeel. The brute lives entirely without reflection. It has consciousness,\n_i.e._, it knows itself and its good and ill, also the objects which\noccasion these. But its knowledge remains always subjective, never becomes\nobjective; everything that enters it seems a matter of course, and\ntherefore can never become for it a theme (an object of exposition) nor a\nproblem (an object of meditation). Its consciousness is thus entirely\n_immanent_. Not certainly the same, but yet of kindred nature, is the\nconsciousness of the common type of man, for his apprehension also of\nthings and the world is predominantly subjective and remains prevalently\nimmanent. It apprehends the things in the world, but not the world; its\nown action and suffering, but not itself. As now in innumerable gradations\nthe distinctness of consciousness rises, reflectiveness appears more and\nmore; and thus it is brought about little by little that sometimes, though\nrarely, and then again in very different degrees of distinctness, the\nquestion passes through the mind like a flash, “What is all this?” or\nagain, “How is it really fashioned?” The first question, if it attains\ngreat distinctness and continued presence, will make the philosopher, and\nthe other, under the same conditions, the artist or the poet. Therefore,\nthen, the high calling of both of these has its root in the reflectiveness\nwhich primarily springs from the distinctness with which they are\nconscious of the world and their own selves, and thereby come to reflect\nupon them. But the whole process springs from the fact that the intellect\nthrough its preponderance frees itself for a time from the will, to which\nit is originally subject.\n\nThe considerations concerning genius here set forth are connected by way\nof supplement with the exposition contained in chapter 21, of the _ever\nwider separation of the will and the intellect_, which can be traced in\nthe whole series of existences. This reaches its highest grade in genius,\nwhere it extends to the entire liberation of the intellect from its root\nthe will, so that here the intellect becomes perfectly free, whereby the\n_world as idea_ first attains to complete objectification.\n\nA few remarks now concerning the individuality of genius. Aristotle has\nalready said, according to Cicero (_Tusc._, i. 33), “_Omnes ingeniosos\nmelancholicos esse_;” which without doubt is connected with the passage of\nAristotle’s “_Problemata_,” xxx. 1. Goethe also says: “My poetic rapture\nwas very small, so long as I only encountered good; but it burnt with a\nbright flame when I fled from threatening evil. The tender poem, like the\nrainbow, is only drawn on a dark ground; hence the genius of the poet\nloves the element of melancholy.”\n\nThis is to be explained from the fact that since the will constantly re‐\nestablishes its original sway over the intellect, the latter more easily\nwithdraws from this under unfavourable personal relations; because it\ngladly turns from adverse circumstances, in order to a certain extent to\ndivert itself, and now directs itself with so much the greater energy to\nthe foreign external world, thus more easily becomes purely objective.\nFavourable personal relations act conversely. Yet as a whole and in\ngeneral the melancholy which accompanies genius depends upon the fact that\nthe brighter the intellect which enlightens the will to live, the more\ndistinctly does it perceive the misery of its condition. The melancholy\ndisposition of highly gifted minds which has so often been observed has\nits emblem in Mont Blanc, the summit of which is for the most part lost in\nclouds; but when sometimes, especially in the early morning, the veil of\nclouds is rent and now the mountain looks down on Chamounix from its\nheight in the heavens above the clouds, then it is a sight at which the\nheart of each of us swells from its profoundest depths. So also the\ngenius, for the most part melancholy, shows at times that peculiar\nserenity already described above, which is possible only for it, and\nsprings from the most perfect objectivity of the mind. It floats like a\nray of light upon his lofty brow: _In tristitia hilaris, in hilaritate\ntristis_.\n\nAll bunglers are so ultimately because their intellect, still too firmly\nbound to the will, only becomes active when spurred on by it, and\ntherefore remains entirely in its service. They are accordingly only\ncapable of personal aims. In conformity with these they produce bad\npictures, insipid poems, shallow, absurd, and very often dishonest\nphilosophemes, when it is to their interest to recommend themselves to\nhigh authorities by a pious disingenuousness. Thus all their action and\nthought is personal. Therefore they succeed at most in appropriating what\nis external, accidental, and arbitrary in the genuine works of others as\nmannerisms, in doing which they take the shell instead of the kernel, and\nyet imagine they have attained to everything, nay, have surpassed those\nworks. If, however, the failure is patent, yet many hope to attain success\nin the end through their good intentions. But it is just this good will\nwhich makes success impossible; because this only pursues personal ends,\nand with these neither art nor poetry nor philosophy can ever be taken\nseriously. Therefore the saying is peculiarly applicable to such persons:\n“They stand in their own light.” They have no idea that it is only the\nintellect delivered from the government of the will and all its projects,\nand therefore freely active, that makes one capable of genuine\nproductions, because it alone imparts true seriousness; and it is well for\nthem that they have not, otherwise they would leap into the water. The\n_good will_ is in _morality_ everything; but in art it is nothing. In art,\nas the word itself indicates (_Kunst_), what alone is of consequence is\nability (_Können_). It all amounts ultimately to this, where the true\n_seriousness_ of the man lies. In almost all it lies exclusively in their\nown well‐being and that of their families; therefore they are in a\nposition to promote this and nothing else; for no purpose, no voluntary\nand intentional effort, imparts the true, profound, and proper\nseriousness, or makes up for it, or more correctly, takes its place. For\nit always remains where nature has placed it; and without it everything is\nonly half performed. Therefore, for the same reason, persons of genius\noften manage so badly for their own welfare. As a leaden weight always\nbrings a body back to the position which its centre of gravity thereby\ndetermined demands, so the true seriousness of the man always draws the\nstrength and attention of the intellect back to that in which it lies;\neverything else the man does _without true seriousness_. Therefore only\nthe exceedingly rare and abnormal men whose true seriousness does not lie\nin the personal and practical, but in the objective and theoretical, are\nin a position to apprehend what is essential in the things of the world,\nthus the highest truths, and reproduce them in any way. For such a\nseriousness of the individual, falling outside himself in the objective,\nis something foreign to the nature of man, something unnatural, or really\nsupernatural: yet on account of this alone is the man _great_; and\ntherefore what he achieves is then ascribed to a _genius_ different from\nhimself, which takes possession of him. To such a man his painting,\npoetry, or thinking is an _end_; to others it is a _means_. The latter\nthereby seek their own things, and, as a rule, they know how to further\nthem, for they flatter their contemporaries, ready to serve their wants\nand humours; therefore for the most part they live in happy circumstances;\nthe former often in very miserable circumstances. For he sacrifices his\npersonal welfare to his _objective end_; he cannot indeed do otherwise,\nbecause his seriousness lies there. They act conversely; therefore they\nare _small_, but he is _great_. Accordingly his work is for all time, but\nthe recognition of it generally only begins with posterity: they live and\ndie with their time. In general he only is great who in his work, whether\nit is practical or theoretical, seeks _not his own concerns_, but pursues\nan _objective end_ alone; he is so, however, even when in the practical\nsphere this end is a misunderstood one, and even if in consequence of this\nit should be a crime. _That he seeks not himself and his own concerns_,\nthis makes him under all circumstances _great_. _Small_, on the other\nhand, is all action which is directed to personal ends; for whoever is\nthereby set in activity knows and finds himself only in his own transient\nand insignificant person. He who is great, again, finds himself in all,\nand therefore in the whole: he lives not, like others, only in the\nmicrocosm, but still more in the macrocosm. Hence the whole interests him,\nand he seeks to comprehend it in order to represent it, or to explain it,\nor to act practically upon it. For it is not strange to him; he feels that\nit concerns him. On account of this extension of his sphere he is called\n_great_. Therefore that lofty predicate belongs only to the true hero, in\nsome sense, and to genius: it signifies that they, contrary to human\nnature, have not sought their own things, have not lived for themselves,\nbut for all. As now clearly the great majority must _constantly_ be small,\nand can _never_ become great, the converse of this, that one should be\ngreat throughout, that is, constantly and every moment, is yet not\npossible—\n\n    “For man is made of common clay,\n    And custom is his nurse.”\n\nEvery great man must often be only the individual, have only himself in\nview, and that means he must be small. Upon this depends the very true\nremark, that no man is a hero to his valet, and not upon the fact that the\nvalet cannot appreciate the hero; which Goethe, in the\n“_Wahlverwandhschaften_” (vol. ii. chap. 5), serves up as an idea of\nOttilie’s.\n\nGenius is its own reward: for the best that one is, one must necessarily\nbe for oneself. “Whoever is born with a talent, to a talent, finds in this\nhis fairest existence,” says Goethe. When we look back at a great man of\nformer times, we do not think, “How happy is he to be still admired by all\nof us!” but, “How happy must he have been in the immediate enjoyment of a\nmind at the surviving traces of which centuries revive themselves!” Not in\nthe fame, but in that whereby it is attained, lies the value, and in the\nproduction of immortal children the pleasure. Therefore those who seek to\nshow the vanity of posthumous fame from the fact that he who obtains it\nknows nothing of it, may be compared to the wiseacre who very learnedly\ntried to demonstrate to the man who cast envious glances at a heap of\noyster‐shells in his neighbour’s yard the absolute uselessness of them.\n\nAccording to the exposition of the nature of genius which has been given,\nit is so far contrary to nature, inasmuch as it consists in this, that the\nintellect, whose real destination is the service of the will, emancipates\nitself from this service in order to be active on its own account.\nAccordingly genius is an intellect which has become untrue to its\ndestination. Upon this depend the _disadvantages_ connected with it, for\nthe consideration of which we shall now prepare the way by comparing\ngenius with the less decided predominance of the intellect.\n\nThe intellect of the normal man, strictly bound to the service of the\nwill, and therefore really only occupied with the apprehension of motives,\nmay be regarded as a complex system of wires, by means of which each of\nthese puppets is set in motion in the theatre of the world. From this\narises the dry, grave seriousness of most people, which is only surpassed\nby that of the brutes, who never laugh. On the other hand, we might\ncompare the genius, with his unfettered intellect, to a living man playing\nalong with the large puppets of the famous puppet‐show at Milan, who would\nbe the only one among them who would understand everything, and would\ntherefore gladly leave the stage for a while to enjoy the play from the\nboxes;—that is the reflectiveness of genius. But even the man of great\nunderstanding and reason, whom one might almost call wise, is very\ndifferent from the genius, and in this way, that his intellect retains a\n_practical_ tendency, is concerned with the choice of the best ends and\nmeans, therefore remains in the service of the will, and accordingly is\noccupied in a manner that is thoroughly in keeping with nature. The firm,\npractical seriousness of life which the Romans denoted _gravitas_\npresupposes that the intellect does not forsake the service of the will in\norder to wander away after that which does not concern the will; therefore\nit does not admit of that separation of the will and the intellect which\nis the condition of genius. The able, nay, eminent man, who is fitted for\ngreat achievements in the practical sphere, is so precisely because\nobjects rouse his will in a lively manner, and spur him on to the\nceaseless investigation of their relations and connections. Thus his\nintellect has grown up closely connected with his will. Before the man of\ngenius, on the contrary, there floats in his objective comprehension the\nphenomenon of the world, as something foreign to him, an object of\ncontemplation, which expels his will from consciousness. Round this point\nturns the distinction between the capacity for _deeds_ and for _works_.\nThe latter demand objectivity and depth of knowledge, which presupposes\nentire separation of the intellect from the will; the former, on the other\nhand, demands the application of knowledge, presence of mind, and\ndecision, which required that the intellect should uninterruptedly attend\nto the service of the will. Where the bond between the intellect and the\nwill is loosened, the intellect, turned away from its natural destination,\nwill neglect the service of the will; it will, for example, even in the\nneed of the moment, preserve its emancipation, and perhaps be unable to\navoid taking in the picturesque impression of the surroundings, from which\ndanger threatens the individual. The intellect of the reasonable and\nunderstanding man, on the other hand, is constantly at its post, is\ndirected to the circumstances and their requirements. Such a man will\ntherefore in all cases determine and carry out what is suitable to the\ncase, and consequently will by no means fall into those eccentricities,\npersonal slips, nay, follies, to which the genius is exposed, because his\nintellect does not remain exclusively the guide and guardian of his will,\nbut sometimes more, sometimes less, is laid claim to by the purely\nobjective. In the contrast of Tasso and Antonio, Goethe has illustrated\nthe opposition, here explained in the abstract, in which these two\nentirely different kinds of capacity stand to each other. The kinship of\ngenius and madness, so often observed, depends chiefly upon that\nseparation of the intellect from the will which is essential to genius,\nbut is yet contrary to nature. But this separation itself is by no means\nto be attributed to the fact that genius is accompanied by less intensity\nof will; for it is rather distinguished by a vehement and passionate\ncharacter; but it is to be explained from this, that the practically\nexcellent person, the man of deeds, has merely the whole, full measure of\nintellect required for an energetic will while most men lack even this;\nbut genius consists in a completely abnormal, actual superfluity of\nintellect, such as is required for the service of no will. On this account\nthe men of genuine works are a thousand times rarer than the men of deeds.\nIt is just that abnormal superfluity of intellect by virtue of which it\nobtains the decided preponderance, sets itself free from the will, and\nnow, forgetting its origin, is freely active from its own strength and\nelasticity; and from this the creations of genius proceed.\n\nNow further, just this, that genius in working consists of the free\nintellect, _i.e._, of the intellect emancipated from the service of the\nwill, has as a consequence that its productions serve no useful ends. The\nwork of genius is music, or philosophy, or paintings, or poetry; it is\nnothing to use. To be of no use belongs to the character of the works of\ngenius; it is their patent of nobility. All other works of men are for the\nmaintenance or easing of our existence; only those we are speaking of are\nnot; they alone exist for their own sake, and are in this sense to be\nregarded as the flower or the net profit of existence. Therefore our heart\nswells at the enjoyment of them, for we rise out of the heavy earthly\natmosphere of want. Analogous to this, we see the beautiful, even apart\nfrom these, rarely combined with the useful. Lofty and beautiful trees\nbear no fruit; the fruit‐trees are small, ugly cripples. The full garden\nrose is not fruitful, but the small, wild, almost scentless roses are. The\nmost beautiful buildings are not the useful ones; a temple is no dwelling‐\nhouse. A man of high, rare mental endowments compelled to apply himself to\na merely useful business, for which the most ordinary man would be fitted,\nis like a costly vase decorated with the most beautiful painting which is\nused as a kitchen pot; and to compare useful people with men of genius is\nlike comparing building‐stone with diamonds.\n\nThus the merely practical man uses his intellect for that for which nature\ndestined it, the comprehension of the relations of things, partly to each\nother, partly to the will of the knowing individual. The genius, on the\nother hand, uses it, contrary to its destination, for the comprehension of\nthe objective nature of things. His mind, therefore, belongs not to\nhimself, but to the world, to the illumination of which, in some sense, it\nwill contribute. From this must spring manifold _disadvantages_ to the\nindividual favoured with genius. For his intellect will in general show\nthose faults which are rarely wanting in any tool which is used for that\nfor which it has not been made. First of all, it will be, as it were, the\nservant of two masters, for on every opportunity it frees itself from the\nservice to which it was destined in order to follow its own ends, whereby\nit often leaves the will very inopportunely in a fix, and thus the\nindividual so gifted becomes more or less useless for life, nay, in his\nconduct sometimes reminds us of madness. Then, on account of its highly\ndeveloped power of knowledge, it will see in things more the universal\nthan the particular; while the service of the will principally requires\nthe knowledge of the particular. But, again, when, as opportunity offers,\nthat whole abnormally heightened power of knowledge directs itself with\nall its energy to the circumstances and miseries of the will, it will be\napt to apprehend these too vividly, to behold all in too glaring colours,\nin too bright a light, and in a fearfully exaggerated form, whereby the\nindividual falls into mere extremes. The following may serve to explain\nthis more accurately. All great theoretical achievements, in whatever\nsphere they may be, are brought about in this way: Their author directs\nall the forces of his mind upon one point, in which he lets them unite and\nconcentrate so strongly, firmly, and exclusively that now the whole of the\nrest of the world vanishes for him, and his object fills all reality. Now\nthis great and powerful concentration which belongs to the privileges of\ngenius sometimes appears for it also in the case of objects of the real\nworld and the events of daily life, which then, brought under such a\nfocus, are magnified to such a monstrous extent that they appear like the\nflea, which under the solar microscope assumes the stature of an elephant.\nHence it arises that highly gifted individuals sometimes are thrown by\ntrifles into violent emotions of the most various kinds, which are\nincomprehensible to others, who see them transported with grief, joy,\ncare, fear, anger, &c., by things which leave the every‐day man quite\ncomposed. Thus, then, the genius lacks _soberness_, which simply consists\nin this, that one sees in things nothing more than actually belongs to\nthem, especially with reference to our possible ends; therefore no sober‐\nminded man can be a genius. With the disadvantages which have been\nenumerated there is also associated hyper‐sensibility, which an abnormally\ndeveloped nervous and cerebral system brings with it, and indeed in union\nwith the vehemence and passionateness of will which is certainly\ncharacteristic of genius, and which exhibits itself physically as energy\nof the pulsation of the heart. From all this very easily arises that\nextravagance of disposition, that vehemence of the emotions, that quick\nchange of mood under prevailing melancholy, which Goethe has presented to\nus in Tasso. What reasonableness, quiet composure, finished surveyal,\ncertainty and proportionateness of behaviour is shown by the well‐endowed\nnormal man in comparison with the now dreamy absentness, and now\npassionate excitement of the man of genius, whose inward pain is the\nmother’s lap of immortal works! To all this must still be added that\ngenius lives essentially alone. It is too rare to find its like with ease,\nand too different from the rest of men to be their companion. With them it\nis the will, with him it is knowledge, that predominates; therefore their\npleasures are not his, and his are not theirs. They are merely moral\nbeings, and have merely personal relations; he is at the same time a pure\nintellect, and as such belongs to the whole of humanity. The course of\nthought of the intellect which is detached from its mother soil, the will,\nand only returns to it periodically, will soon show itself entirely\ndifferent from that of the normal intellect, still cleaving to its stem.\nFor this reason, and also on account of the dissimilarity of the pace, the\nformer is not adapted for thinking in common, _i.e._, for conversation\nwith the others: they will have as little pleasure in him and his\noppressive superiority as he will in them. They will therefore feel more\ncomfortable with their equals, and he will prefer the entertainment of his\nequals, although, as a rule, this is only possible through the works they\nhave left behind them. Therefore Chamfort says very rightly: “_Il y a peu\nde vices qui empêchent un homme d’avoir beaucoup d’amis, autant que\npeuvent le faire de trop grandes qualités_.” The happiest lot that can\nfall to the genius is release from action, which is not his element, and\nleisure for production. From all this it results that although genius may\nhighly bless him who is gifted with it, in the hours in which, abandoned\nto it, he revels unhindered in its delight, yet it is by no means fitted\nto procure for him a happy course of life; rather the contrary. This is\nalso confirmed by the experience recorded in biographies. Besides this\nthere is also an external incongruity, for the genius, in his efforts and\nachievements themselves, is for the most part in contradiction and\nconflict with his age. Mere men of talent come always at the right time;\nfor as they are roused by the spirit of their age, and called forth by its\nneeds, they are also capable only of satisfying these. They therefore go\nhand in hand with the advancing culture of their contemporaries or with\nthe gradual progress of a special science: for this they reap reward and\napproval. But to the next generation their works are no longer enjoyable;\nthey must be replaced by others, which again are not permanent. The\ngenius, on the contrary, comes into his age like a comet into the paths of\nthe planets, to whose well‐regulated and comprehensible order its entirely\neccentric course is foreign. Accordingly he cannot go hand in hand with\nthe existing, regular progress of the culture of the age, but flings his\nworks far out on to the way in front (as the dying emperor flung his spear\namong the enemy), upon which time has first to overtake them. His relation\nto the culminating men of talent of his time might be expressed in the\nwords of the Evangelist: “Ὁ καιρος ὁ εμος ουπω παρεστιν; ὁ δε καιρος ὁ\nὑμετερος παντοτε εστιν ἑτοιμος” (John vii. 6). The man of talent can\nachieve what is beyond the power of achievement of other men, but not what\nis beyond their power of apprehension: therefore he at once finds those\nwho prize him. But the achievement of the man of genius, on the contrary,\ntranscends not only the power of achievement, but also the power of\napprehension of others; therefore they do not become directly conscious of\nhim. The man of talent is like the marksman who hits a mark the others\ncannot hit; the man of genius is like the marksman who hits a mark they\ncannot even see to; therefore they only get news of him indirectly, and\nthus late; and even this they only accept upon trust and faith.\nAccordingly Goethe says in one of his letters, “Imitation is inborn in us;\nwhat to imitate is not easily recognised. Rarely is what is excellent\nfound; still more rarely is it prized.” And Chamfort says: “_Il en est de\nla valeur des hommes comme de celle des diamans, qui à une certaine mesure\nde grosseur, de pureté, de perfection, ont un prix fixe et marqué, mais\nqui, par‐delà cette mesure, restent sans prix, et ne trouvent point\nd’acheteurs_.” And Bacon of Verulam has also expressed it: “_Infimarum\nvirtutum, apud vulgus, laus est, mediarum admiratio, supremarum sensus\nnullus_” (_De augm. sc._, L. vi. c. 3). Indeed, one might perhaps reply,\n_Apud vulgus!_ But I must then come to his assistance with Machiavelli’s\nassurance: “_Nel mondo non è se non volgo_;”(12) as also Thilo (_Ueber den\nRuhm_) remarks, that to the vulgar herd there generally belongs one more\nthan each of us believes. It is a consequence of this late recognition of\nthe works of the man of genius that they are rarely enjoyed by their\ncontemporaries, and accordingly in the freshness of colour which\nsynchronism and presence imparts, but, like figs and dates, much more in a\ndry than in a fresh state.\n\nIf, finally, we consider genius from the somatic side, we find it\nconditioned by several anatomical and physiological qualities, which\nindividually are seldom present in perfection, and still more seldom\nperfect together, but which are yet all indispensably required; so that\nthis explains why genius only appears as a perfectly isolated and almost\nportentous exception. The fundamental condition is an abnormal\npredominance of sensibility over irritability and reproductive power; and\nwhat makes the matter more difficult, this must take place in a male body.\n(Women may have great talent, but no genius, for they always remain\nsubjective.) Similarly the cerebral system must be perfectly separated\nfrom the ganglion system by complete isolation, so that it stands in\ncomplete opposition to the latter; and thus the brain pursues its\nparasitic life on the organism in a very decided, isolated, powerful, and\nindependent manner. Certainly it will thereby very easily affect the rest\nof the organism injuriously, and through its heightened life and ceaseless\nactivity wear it out prematurely, unless it is itself possessed of\nenergetic vital force and a good constitution: thus the latter belong to\nthe conditions of genius. Indeed even a good stomach is a condition on\naccount of the special and close agreement of this part with the brain.\nBut chiefly the brain must be of unusual development and magnitude,\nespecially broad and high. On the other hand, its depth will be inferior,\nand the cerebrum will abnormally preponderate in proportion to the\ncerebellum. Without doubt much depends upon the configuration of the brain\nas a whole and in its parts; but our knowledge is not yet sufficient to\ndetermine this accurately, although we easily recognise the form of skull\nthat indicates a noble and lofty intelligence. The texture of the mass of\nthe brain must be of extreme fineness and perfection, and consist of the\npurest, most concentrated, tenderest, and most excitable nerve‐substance;\ncertainly the quantitative proportion of the white to the grey matter has\na decided influence, which, however, we are also unable as yet to specify.\nHowever, the report of the _post‐mortem_ on the body of Byron(13) shows\nthat in his case the white matter was in unusually large proportion to the\ngrey, and also that his brain weighed six pounds. Cuvier’s brain weighed\nfive pounds; the normal weight is three pounds. In contrast to the\nsuperior size of the brain, the spinal cord and nerves must be unusually\nthin. A beautifully arched, high and broad skull of thin bone must protect\nthe brain without in any way cramping it. This whole quality of the brain\nand nervous system is the inheritance from the mother, to which we shall\nreturn in the following book. But it is quite insufficient to produce the\nphenomenon of genius if the inheritance from the father is not added, a\nlively, passionate temperament, which exhibits itself somatically as\nunusual energy of the heart, and consequently of the circulation of the\nblood, especially towards the head. For, in the first place, that\nturgescence peculiar to the brain on account of which it presses against\nits walls is increased by this; therefore it forces itself out of any\nopening in these which has been occasioned by some injury; and secondly,\nfrom the requisite strength of the heart the brain receives that internal\nmovement different from its constant rising and sinking at every breath,\nwhich consists in a shaking of its whole mass at every pulsation of the\nfour cerebral arteries, and the energy of which must correspond to the\nhere increased quantity of the brain, as this movement in general is an\nindispensable condition of its activity. To this, therefore, small stature\nand especially a short neck is favourable, because by the shorter path the\nblood reaches the brain with more energy; and on this account great minds\nhave seldom large bodies. Yet that shortness of the distance is not\nindispensable; for example, Goethe was of more than middle height. If,\nhowever, the whole condition connected with the circulation of the blood,\nand therefore coming from the father is wanting, the good quality of the\nbrain coming from the mother, will at most produce a man of talent, a fine\nunderstanding, which the phlegmatic temperament thus introduced supports;\nbut a phlegmatic genius is impossible. This condition coming from the\nfather explains many faults of temperament described above. But, on the\nother hand, if this condition exists without the former, thus with an\nordinarily or even badly constructed brain, it gives vivacity without\nmind, heat without light, hot‐headed persons, men of unsupportable\nrestlessness and petulance. That of two brothers only one has genius, and\nthat one generally the elder, as, for example, in Kant’s case, is\nprimarily to be explained from the fact that the father was at the age of\nstrength and passion only when he was begotten; although also the other\ncondition originating with the mother may be spoiled by unfavourable\ncircumstances.\n\nI have further to add here a special remark on the _childlike_ character\nof the genius, _i.e._, on a certain resemblance which exists between\ngenius and the age of childhood. In childhood, as in the case of genius,\nthe cerebral and nervous system decidedly preponderates, for its\ndevelopment hurries far in advance of that of the rest of the organism; so\nthat already at the seventh year the brain has attained its full extension\nand mass. Therefore, Bichat says: “_Dans l’enfance le système nerveux,\ncomparé au musculaire, est proportionellement plus considérable que dans\ntous les âges suivans, tandis que par la suite, la pluspart des autres\nsystèmes prédominent sur celui‐ci. On sait que, pour bien voir les nerfs,\non choisit toujours les enfans_” (_De la vie et de la mort_, art. 8, § 6).\nOn the other hand, the development of the genital system begins latest,\nand irritability, reproduction, and genital function are in full force\nonly at the age of manhood, and then, as a rule, they predominate over the\nbrain function. Hence it is explicable that children, in general, are so\nsensible, reasonable, desirous of information, and teachable, nay, on the\nwhole, are more disposed and fitted for all theoretical occupation than\ngrown‐up people. They have, in consequence of that course of development,\nmore intellect than will, _i.e._, than inclinations, desire, and passion.\nFor intellect and brain are one, and so also is the genital system one\nwith the most vehement of all desires: therefore I have called the latter\nthe focus of the will. Just because the fearful activity of this system\nstill slumbers, while that of the brain has already full play, childhood\nis the time of innocence and happiness, the paradise of life, the lost\nEden on which we look longingly back through the whole remaining course of\nour life. But the basis of that happiness is that in childhood our whole\nexistence lies much more in knowing than in willing—a condition which is\nalso supported from without by the novelty of all objects. Hence in the\nmorning sunshine of life the world lies before us so fresh, so magically\ngleaming, so attractive. The small desires, the weak inclinations, and\ntrifling cares of childhood are only a weak counterpoise to that\npredominance of intellectual activity. The innocent and clear glance of\nchildren, at which we revive ourselves, and which sometimes in particular\ncases reaches the sublime contemplative expression with which Raphael has\nglorified his cherubs, is to be explained from what has been said.\nAccordingly the mental powers develop much earlier than the needs they are\ndestined to serve; and here, as everywhere, nature proceeds very\ndesignedly. For in this time of predominating intelligence the man\ncollects a great store of knowledge for future wants which at the time are\nforeign to him. Therefore his intellect, now unceasingly active, eagerly\napprehends all phenomena, broods over them and stores them up carefully\nfor the coming time,—like the bees, who gather a great deal more honey\nthan they can consume, in anticipation of future need. Certainly what a\nman acquires of insight and knowledge up to the age of puberty is, taken\nas a whole, more than all that he afterwards learns, however learned he\nmay become; for it is the foundation of all human knowledge. Up till the\nsame time plasticity predominates in the child’s body, and later, by a\nmetastasis, its forces throw themselves into the system of generation; and\nthus with puberty the sexual passion appears, and now, little by little,\nthe will gains the upper hand. Then childhood, which is prevailingly\ntheoretical and desirous of learning, is followed by the restless, now\nstormy, now melancholy, period of youth, which afterwards passes into the\nvigorous and earnest age of manhood. Just because that impulse pregnant\nwith evil is wanting in the child is its volition so adapted and\nsubordinated to knowledge, whence arises that character of innocence,\nintelligence, and reasonableness which is peculiar to the age of\nchildhood. On what, then, the likeness between childhood and genius\ndepends I scarcely need to express further: upon the surplus of the powers\nof knowledge over the needs of the will, and the predominance of the\npurely intellectual activity which springs from this. Really every child\nis to a certain extent a genius, and the genius is to a certain extent a\nchild. The relationship of the two shows itself primarily in the naïveté\nand sublime simplicity which is characteristic of true genius; and besides\nthis it appears in several traits, so that a certain childishness\ncertainly belongs to the character of the genius. In Riemer’s\n“_Mittheilungen über Goethe_” (vol. i. p. 184) it is related that Herder\nand others found fault with Goethe, saying he was always a big child.\nCertainly they were right in what they said, but they were not right in\nfinding fault with it. It has also been said of Mozart that all his life\nhe remained a child (Nissen’s Biography of Mozart, p. 2 and 529).\nSchlichtegroll’s “_Nekrology_” (for 1791, vol. ii. p. 109) says of him:\n“In his art he early became a man, but in all other relations he always\nremained a child.” Every genius is even for this reason a big child; he\nlooks out into the world as into something strange, a play, and therefore\nwith purely objective interest. Accordingly he has just as little as the\nchild that dull gravity of ordinary men, who, since they are capable only\nof subjective interests, always see in things mere motives for their\naction. Whoever does not to a certain extent remain all his life a big\nchild, but becomes a grave, sober, thoroughly composed, and reasonable\nman, may be a very useful and capable citizen of this world; but never a\ngenius. In fact, the genius is so because that predominance of the\nsensible system and of intellectual activity which is natural to childhood\nmaintains itself in him in an abnormal manner through his whole life, thus\nhere becomes perennial. A trace of this certainly shows itself in many\nordinary men up to the period of their youth; therefore, for example, in\nmany students a purely intellectual tendency and an eccentricity\nsuggestive of genius is unmistakable. But nature returns to her track;\nthey assume the chrysalis form and reappear at the age of manhood, as\nincarnate Philistines, at whom we are startled when we meet them again in\nlater years. Upon all this that has been expounded here depends Goethe’s\nbeautiful remark: “Children do not perform what they promise; young people\nvery seldom; and if they do keep their word, the world does not keep its\nword with them” (_Wahlverwandtschaften_, Pt. i. ch. 10)—the world which\nafterwards bestows the crowns which it holds aloft for merit on those who\nare the tools of its low aims or know how to deceive it. In accordance\nwith what has been said, as there is a mere beauty of youth, which almost\nevery one at some time possesses (_beauté du diable_), so there is a mere\nintellectuality of youth, a certain mental nature disposed and adapted for\napprehending, understanding, and learning, which every one has in\nchildhood, and some have still in youth, but which is afterwards lost,\njust like that beauty. Only in the case of a very few, the chosen, the\none, like the other, lasts through the whole life; so that even in old age\na trace of it still remains visible: these are the truly beautiful and the\nmen of true genius.\n\nThe predominance of the cerebral nervous system and of intelligence in\nchildhood, which is here under consideration, together with the decline of\nit in riper age, receives important illustration and confirmation from the\nfact that in the species of animals which stands nearest to man, the apes,\nthe same relation is found in a striking degree. It has by degrees become\ncertain that the highly intelligent orang‐outang is a young pongo, which\nwhen it has grown up loses the remarkable human look of its countenance,\nand also its astonishing intelligence, because the lower and brutal part\nof its face increases in size, the forehead thereby recedes, large\n_cristæ_, muscular developments, give the skull a brutish form, the\nactivity of the nervous system sinks, and in its place extraordinary\nmuscular strength develops, which, as it is sufficient for its\npreservation, makes the great intelligence now superfluous. Especially\nimportant is what Fréd. Cuvier has said in this reference, and Flourens\nhas illustrated in a review of the “_Histoire Naturelle_” of the former,\nwhich appeared in the September number of the “_Journal des Savans_” of\n1839, and was also separately printed with some additions, under the\ntitle, “_Résumé analytique des observations de Fr. Cuvier sur l’instinct\net l’intelligence des animaux_,” _p. Flourens_, 1841. It is there said, p.\n50: “_L’intelligence de l’orang‐outang, cette intelligence si développée,\net développée de si bonne heure, décroit avec l’âge. L’orang‐outang,\nlorsqu’il est jeune, nous étonne par sa pénétration, par sa ruse, par son\nadresse; l’orang‐outang, devenu adulte, n’est plus qu’un animal grossier,\nbrutal, intraitable. Et il en est de tous les singes comme de l’orang‐\noutang. Dans tous, l’intelligence décroit à mesure que les forces\ns’accroissent. L’animal qui a le plus d’intelligence, n’a toute cette\nintelligence que dans le jeune âge._” Further, p. 87: “_Les singes de tous\nles genres offrent ce rapport inverse de l’âge et de l’intelligence.\nAinsi, par exemple, l’Entelle (espèce de guenon du sous‐genre des Semno‐\npithèques et l’un des singes vénérés dans la religion des Brames) a, dans\nle __ jeune âge, le front large, le museau peu saillant, le crâne élevé,\narrondi, etc. Avec l’âge le front disparait, recule, le museau proémine;\net le moral ne change pas moins que le physique: l’apathie, la violence,\nle besoin de solitude, remplacent la pénétration, la docilité, la\nconfiance. __‹ __Ces différences sont si grandes,__ ›__ dit Mr. Fréd.\nCuvier, __‹ __que dans l’habitude où nous sommes de juger des actions des\nanimaux par les nôtres, nous prendrions le jeune animal pour un individu\nde l’âge, où toutes les qualités morales de l’espèce sont acquises, et\nl’Entelle adulte pour un individu qui n’aurait encore que ses forces\nphysiques. Mais la nature n’en agit pas ainsi avec ces animaux, qui ne\ndoivent pas sortir de la sphère étroite, qui leur est fixée, et à qui il\nsuffit en quelque sorte de pouvoir veiller à leur conservation. Pour cela\nl’intelligence était nécessaire, quand la force n’existait pas, et quand\ncelle‐ci est acquise, toute autre puissance perd de son utilité.__ ›_” And\np. 118: “_La conservation des espèces ne repose pas moins sur les qualités\nintellectuelles des animaux, que sur leurs qualités organiques_.” This\nlast confirms my principle that the intellect, like the claws and teeth,\nis nothing else than a weapon in the service of the will.\n\nChapter XXXII.(14) On Madness.\n\nThe health of the mind properly consists in perfect recollection. Of\ncourse this is not to be understood as meaning that our memory preserves\neverything. For the past course of our life shrinks up in time, as the\npath of the wanderer looking back shrinks up in space: sometimes it is\ndifficult for us to distinguish the particular years; the days have for\nthe most part become unrecognisable. Really, however, only the exactly\nsimilar events, recurring an innumerable number of times, so that their\nimages, as it were, conceal each other, ought so to run together in the\nmemory that they are individually unrecognisable; on the other hand, every\nevent in any way peculiar or significant we must be able to find again in\nmemory, if the intellect is normal, vigorous, and quite healthy. In the\ntext I have explained _madness_ as the _broken thread_ of this memory,\nwhich still runs on regularly, although in constantly decreasing fulness\nand distinctness. The following considerations may serve to confirm this.\n\nThe memory of a healthy man affords a certainty as to an event he has\nwitnessed, which is regarded as just as firm and sure as his present\napprehension of things; therefore, if sworn to by him, this event is\nthereby established in a court of law. On the other hand, the mere\nsuspicion of madness will at once weaken the testimony of a witness. Here,\nthen, lies the criterion between the healthy mind and insanity. Whenever I\ndoubt whether an event which I remember really took place, I throw upon\nmyself the suspicion of madness: unless it is that I am uncertain whether\nit was not a mere dream. If another doubts the reality of an event,\nrelated by me as an eye‐witness, without mistrusting my honesty, then he\nregards me as insane. Whoever comes at last, through constantly recounting\nan event which originally was fabricated by him, to believe in it himself\nis, in this one point, really insane. We may ascribe to an insane person\nflashes of wit, single clever thoughts, even correct judgments, but his\ntestimony as to past events no man will consider valid. In the Lalita‐\nvistara, well known to be the history of Buddha Sakya‐Muni, it is related\nthat at the moment of his birth all the sick became well, all the blind\nsaw, all the deaf heard, and all mad people “recovered their memory.” This\nlast is mentioned in two passages.(15)\n\nMy own experience of many years has led me to the opinion that madness\noccurs proportionally most frequently among actors. But what a misuse they\nmake of their memory! Daily they have to learn a new part or refresh an\nold one; but these parts are entirely without connection, nay, are in\ncontradiction and contrast with each other, and every evening the actor\nstrives to forget himself entirely and be some quite different person.\nThis kind of thing paves the way for madness.\n\nThe exposition of the origin of madness given in the text will become more\ncomprehensible if it is remembered how unwillingly we think of things\nwhich powerfully injure our interests, wound our pride, or interfere with\nour wishes; with what difficulty do we determine to lay such things before\nour own intellect for careful and serious investigation; how easily, on\nthe other hand, we unconsciously break away or sneak off from them again;\nhow, on the contrary, agreeable events come into our minds of their own\naccord, and, if driven away, constantly creep in again, so that we dwell\non them for hours together. In that resistance of the will to allowing\nwhat is contrary to it to come under the examination of the intellect lies\nthe place at which madness can break in upon the mind. Each new adverse\nevent must be assimilated by the intellect, _i.e._, it must receive a\nplace in the system of the truths connected with our will and its\ninterests, whatever it may have to displace that is more satisfactory.\nWhenever this has taken place, it already pains us much less; but this\noperation itself is often very painful, and also, in general, only takes\nplace slowly and with resistance. However, the health of the mind can only\ncontinue so long as this is in each case properly carried out. If, on the\ncontrary, in some particular case, the resistance and struggles of the\nwill against the apprehension of some knowledge reaches such a degree that\nthat operation is not performed in its integrity, then certain events or\ncircumstances become for the intellect completely suppressed, because the\nwill cannot endure the sight of them, and then, for the sake of the\nnecessary connection, the gaps that thus arise are filled up at pleasure;\nthus madness appears. For the intellect has given up its nature to please\nthe will: the man now imagines what does not exist. Yet the madness which\nhas thus arisen is now the lethe of unendurable suffering; it was the last\nremedy of harassed nature, _i.e._, of the will.\n\nLet me mention here in passing a proof of my view which is worth noticing.\nCarlo Gozzi, in the “_Monstro turchino_,” act i. scene 2, presents to us a\nperson who has drunk a magic potion which produces forgetfulness, and this\nperson appears exactly like a madman.\n\nIn accordance with the above exposition one may thus regard the origin of\nmadness as a violent “casting out of the mind” of anything, which,\nhowever, is only possible by “taking into the head” something else. The\nconverse process is more rare, that the “taking into the head” comes\nfirst, and the “casting out of the mind” second. It takes place, however,\nin those cases in which the occasion of insanity is kept constantly\npresent to the mind and cannot be escaped from; thus, for example, in the\ncase of many who have gone mad from love, erotomaniacs, where the occasion\nof their madness is constantly longed after; also in the case of madness\nwhich has resulted from the fright of some sudden horrible occurrence.\nSuch patients cling, as it were, convulsively to the thought they have\ngrasped, so that no other, or at least none opposed to it, can arise. In\nboth processes, however, what is essential to madness remains the same,\nthe impossibility of a uniformly connected recollection, such as is the\nbasis of our healthy and rational reflection. Perhaps the contrast of the\nways in which they arise, set forth here, might, if applied with judgment,\nafford a sharp and profound principle of division of delusions proper.\n\nFor the rest, I have only considered the physical origin of madness, thus\nwhat is introduced by external, objective occasions. More frequently,\nhowever, it depends upon purely physical causes, upon malformations or\npartial disorganisation of the brain or its membranes, also upon the\ninfluence which other parts affected with disease exercise upon the brain.\nPrincipally in the latter kind of madness false sense‐perceptions,\nhallucinations, may arise. Yet the two causes of madness will generally\npartake of each other, particularly the psychical of the physical. It is\nthe same as with suicide, which is rarely brought about by an external\noccasion alone, but a certain physical discomfort lies at its foundation;\nand according to the degree which this attains to a greater or less\nexternal occasion is required; only in the case of the very highest degree\nis no external occasion at all required. Therefore there is no misfortune\nso great that it would influence every one to suicide, and none so small\nthat one like it has not already led to it. I have shown the psychical\norigin of madness as, at least according to all appearance, it is brought\nabout in the healthy mind by a great misfortune. In the case of those who\nare already strongly disposed to madness physically a very small\ndisappointment will be sufficient to induce it. For example, I remember a\nman in a madhouse who had been a soldier, and had gone out of his mind\nbecause his officer had addressed him as _Er_.(16) In the case of decided\nphysical disposition no occasion at all is required when this has come to\nmaturity. The madness which has sprung from purely psychical causes may,\nperhaps, by the violent perversion of the course of thought which has\nproduced it, also introduce a kind of paralysis or other depravity of some\npart of the brain, which, if not soon done away with, becomes permanent.\nTherefore madness is only curable at first, and not after a longer time.\n\nPinel taught that there is a _mania sine delirio_, frenzy without\ninsanity. This was controverted by Esquirol, and since then much has been\nsaid for and against it. The question can only be decided empirically. But\nif such a state really does occur, then it is to be explained from the\nfact that here the will periodically entirely withdraws itself from the\ngovernment and guidance of the intellect, and consequently of motives, and\nthus it then appears as a blind, impetuous, destructive force of nature,\nand accordingly manifests itself as the desire to annihilate everything\nthat comes in its way. The will thus let loose is like the stream which\nhas broken through the dam, the horse that has thrown his rider, or a\nclock out of which the regulating screws have been taken. Yet only the\nreason, thus _reflective_ knowledge, is included in that suspension, not\n_intuitive_ knowledge also; otherwise the will would remain entirely\nwithout guidance, and consequently the man would be immovable. But, on the\ncontrary, the man in a frenzy apprehends objects, for he breaks out upon\nthem; thus he has also consciousness of his present action, and afterwards\nremembrance of it. But he is entirely without reflection, thus without any\nguidance of the reason, consequently quite incapable of any consideration\nor regard for the present, the past, or the future. When the attack is\nover, and the reason has regained its command, its function is correct,\nbecause here its proper activity has not been perverted or destroyed, but\nonly the will has found the means to withdraw itself from it entirely for\na while.\n\nChapter XXXIII.(17) Isolated Remarks On Natural Beauty.\n\nWhat contributes among other things to make the sight of a beautiful\nlandscape so exceedingly delightful is the perfect _truth and consistency_\nof nature. Certainly nature does not follow here the guidance of logic in\nthe connection of the grounds of knowledge, of antecedents and\nconsequences, premisses and conclusions; but still it follows what is for\nit analogous to the law of causality in the visible connection of causes\nand effects. Every modification, even the slightest, which an object\nreceives from its position, foreshortening, concealment, distance,\nlighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, &c., is, through its effect\nupon the eye, unerringly given and accurately taken account of: the Indian\nproverb, “Every corn of rice casts its shadow,” finds here its\nconfirmation. Therefore here everything shows itself so consistent,\naccurately regular, connected, and scrupulously right; here there are no\nevasions. If now we consider the sight of a beautiful view, merely as a\nbrain‐phenomenon, it is the only one among the complicated brain‐phenomena\nwhich is always absolutely regular, blameless, and perfect; all the rest,\nespecially our own mental operations, are, in form or material, affected\nmore or less with defects or inaccuracies. From this excellence of the\nsight of beautiful nature, is the harmonious and thoroughly satisfying\ncharacter of its impression to be explained, and also the favourable\neffect which it has upon our whole thought, which in its formal part\nthereby becomes more correctly disposed, and to a certain extent purified,\nfor that brain‐phenomenon which alone is entirely faultless sets the brain\nin general in perfectly normal action; and now the thought seeks to follow\nthat method of nature in the consistency, connectedness, regularity, and\nharmony of all its processes, after being brought by it into the right\nswing. A beautiful view is therefore a cathartic of the mind, as music,\naccording to Aristotle, is of the feeling, and in its presence one will\nthink most correctly.\n\nThat the sight of a mountain chain suddenly rising before us throws us so\neasily into a serious, and even sublime mood may partly depend upon the\nfact that the form of the mountains and the outline of the chain arising\nfrom it is the only constantly _permanent_ line of the landscape, for the\nmountains alone defy the decay which soon sweeps away everything else,\nespecially our own ephemeral person. Not that at the sight of the mountain\nchain all this appeared distinctly in our consciousness, but an obscure\nfeeling of it is the fundamental note of our mood.\n\nI would like to know why it is that while for the human form and\ncountenance light from above is altogether the most advantageous, and\nlight from below the most unfavourable, with regard to landscape nature\nexactly the converse holds good.\n\nYet how æsthetic is nature! Every spot that is entirely uncultivated and\nwild, _i.e._, left free to itself, however small it may be, if only the\nhand of man remains absent, it decorates at once in the most tasteful\nmanner, clothes it with plants, flowers, and shrubs, whose unforced\nnature, natural grace, and tasteful grouping bears witness that they have\nnot grown up under the rod of correction of the great egoist, but that\nnature has here moved freely. Every neglected plant at once becomes\nbeautiful. Upon this rests the principle of the English garden, which is\nas much as possible to conceal art, so that it may appear as if nature had\nhere moved freely; for only then is it perfectly beautiful, _i.e._, shows\nin the greatest distinctness the objectification of the still unconscious\nwill to live, which here unfolds itself with the greatest naïveté, because\nthe forms are not, as in the animal world, determined by external ends,\nbut only immediately by the soil, climate, and a mysterious third\ninfluence on account of which so many plants which have originally sprung\nup in the same soil and climate yet show such different forms and\ncharacters.\n\nThe great difference between the English, or more correctly the Chinese,\ngarden and the old French, which is now always becoming more rare, yet\nstill exists in a few magnificent examples, ultimately rests upon the fact\nthat the former is planned in an objective spirit, the latter in a\nsubjective. In the former the will of nature, as it objectifies itself in\ntree and shrub, mountain and waterfall, is brought to the purest possible\nexpression of these its Ideas, thus of its own inner being. In the French\ngarden, on the other hand, only the will of the possessor of it is\nmirrored, which has subdued nature so that instead of its Ideas it bears\nas tokens of its slavery the forms which correspond to that will, and\nwhich are forcibly imposed upon it—clipped hedges, trees cut into all\nkinds of forms, straight alleys, arched avenues, &c.\n\nChapter XXXIV.(18) On The Inner Nature Of Art.\n\nNot merely philosophy but also the fine arts work at bottom towards the\nsolution of the problem of existence. For in every mind that once gives\nitself up to the purely objective contemplation of nature a desire has\nbeen excited, however concealed and unconscious it may be, to comprehend\nthe true nature of things, of life and existence. For this alone has\ninterest for the intellect as such, _i.e._, for the pure subject of\nknowledge which has become free from the aims of the will; as for the\nsubject which knows as a mere individual the aims of the will alone have\ninterest. On this account the result of the purely objective apprehension\nof things is an expression more of the nature of life and existence, more\nan answer to the question, “What is life?” Every genuine and successful\nwork of art answers this question in its own way with perfect correctness.\nBut all the arts speak only the naive and childish language of perception,\nnot the abstract and serious language of _reflection_; their answer is\ntherefore a fleeting image: not permanent and general knowledge. Thus for\n_perception_ every work of art answers that question, every painting,\nevery statue, every poem, every scene upon the stage: music also answers\nit; and indeed more profoundly than all the rest, for in its language,\nwhich is understood with absolute directness, but which is yet\nuntranslatable into that of the reason, the inner nature of all life and\nexistence expresses itself. Thus all the other arts hold up to the\nquestioner a perceptible image, and say, “Look here, this is life.” Their\nanswer, however correct it may be, will yet always afford merely a\ntemporary, not a complete and final, satisfaction. For they always give\nmerely a fragment, an example instead of the rule, not the whole, which\ncan only be given in the universality of the _conception_. For this,\ntherefore, thus for reflection and in the abstract, to give an answer\nwhich just on that account shall be permanent and suffice for always, is\nthe task of philosophy. However, we see here upon what the relationship of\nphilosophy to the fine arts rests, and can conclude from that to what\nextent the capacity of both, although in its direction and in secondary\nmatters very different, is yet in its root the same.\n\nEvery work of art accordingly really aims at showing us life and things as\nthey are in truth, but cannot be directly discerned by every one through\nthe mist of objective and subjective contingencies. Art takes away this\nmist.\n\nThe works of the poets, sculptors, and representative artists in general\ncontain an unacknowledged treasure of profound wisdom; just because out of\nthem the wisdom of the nature of things itself speaks, whose utterances\nthey merely interpret by illustrations and purer repetitions. On this\naccount, however, every one who reads the poem or looks at the picture\nmust certainly contribute out of his own means to bring that wisdom to\nlight; accordingly he comprehends only so much of it as his capacity and\nculture admit of; as in the deep sea each sailor only lets down the lead\nas far as the length of the line will allow. Before a picture, as before a\nprince, every one must stand, waiting to see whether and what it will\nspeak to him; and, as in the case of a prince, so here he must not himself\naddress it, for then he would only hear himself. It follows from all this\nthat in the works of the representative arts all truth is certainly\ncontained, yet only _virtualiter_ or _implicite_; philosophy, on the other\nhand, endeavours to supply the same truth _actualiter_ and _explicite_,\nand therefore, in this sense, is related to art as wine to grapes. What it\npromises to supply would be, as it were, an already realised and clear\ngain, a firm and abiding possession; while that which proceeds from the\nachievements and works of art is one which has constantly to be reproduced\nanew. Therefore, however, it makes demands, not only upon those who\nproduce its works, but also upon those who are to enjoy them which are\ndiscouraging and hard to comply with. Therefore its public remains small,\nwhile that of art is large.\n\nThe co‐operation of the beholder, which is referred to above, as demanded\nfor the enjoyment of a work of art, depends partly upon the fact that\nevery work of art can only produce its effect through the medium of the\nfancy; therefore it must excite this, and can never allow it to be left\nout of the play and remain inactive. This is a condition of the æsthetic\neffect, and therefore a fundamental law of all fine arts. But it follows\nfrom this that, through the work of art, everything must not be directly\ngiven to the senses, but rather only so much as is demanded to lead the\nfancy on to the right path; something, and indeed the ultimate thing, must\nalways be left over for the fancy to do. Even the author must always leave\nsomething over for the reader to think; for Voltaire has very rightly\nsaid, “_Le secret d’être ennuyeux, c’est de tout dire_.” But besides this,\nin art the best of all is too spiritual to be given directly to the\nsenses; it must be born in the imagination of the beholder, although\nbegotten by the work of art. It depends upon this that the sketches of\ngreat masters often effect more than their finished pictures; although\nanother advantage certainly contributes to this, namely, that they are\ncompleted offhand in the moment of conception; while the perfected\npainting is only produced through continued effort, by means of skilful\ndeliberation and persistent intention, for the inspiration cannot last\ntill it is completed. From the fundamental æsthetical law we are speaking\nof, it is further to be explained why wax figures never produce an\næsthetic effect, and therefore are not properly works of fine art,\nalthough it is just in them that the imitation of nature is able to reach\nits highest grade. For they leave nothing for the imagination to do.\nSculpture gives merely the form without the colour; painting gives the\ncolour, but the mere appearance of the form; thus both appeal to the\nimagination of the beholder. The wax figure, on the other hand, gives all,\nform and colour at once; whence arises the appearance of reality, and the\nimagination is left out of account. Poetry, on the contrary, appeals\nindeed to the imagination alone, which it sets in action by means of mere\nwords.\n\nAn arbitrary playing with the means of art without a proper knowledge of\nthe end is, in every art, the fundamental characteristic of the dabbler.\nSuch a man shows himself in the pillars that support nothing, aimless\nvolutes, juttings and projections of bad architecture, in the meaningless\nruns and figures, together with the aimless noise of bad music, in the\njingling of the rhymes of senseless poetry, &c.\n\nIt follows from the preceding chapter, and from my whole view of art, that\nits aim is the facilitating of the knowledge of the Ideas of the world (in\nthe Platonic sense, the only one which I recognise for the word Idea). The\nIdeas, however, are essentially something perceptible, which, therefore,\nin its fuller determinations, is inexhaustible. The communication of such\nan Idea can therefore only take place on the path of perception, which is\nthat of art. Whoever, therefore, is filled with the comprehension of an\nIdea is justified if he chooses art as the medium of its communication.\nThe mere conception, on the other hand, is something completely\ndeterminable, therefore exhaustible, and distinctly thought, the whole\ncontent of which can be coldly and dryly expressed in words. Now to desire\nto communicate such a conception by means of a work of art is a very\nuseless circumlocution, indeed belongs to that playing with the means of\nart without knowledge of its end which has just been condemned. Therefore\na work of art which has proceeded from mere distinct conceptions is always\nungenuine. If now, in considering a work of plastic art, or in reading a\npoem, or in hearing a piece of music (which aims at describing something\ndefinite), we see, through all the rich materials of art, the distinct,\nlimited, cold, dry conception shine out, and at last come to the front,\nthe conception which was the kernel of this work, the whole notion of\nwhich consequently consisted in the distinct thinking of it, and\naccordingly is absolutely exhausted by its communication, we feel\ndisgusted and indignant, for we see ourselves deceived and cheated out of\nour interest and attention. We are only perfectly satisfied by the\nimpression of a work of art when it leaves something which, with all our\nthinking about it, we cannot bring down to the distinctness of a\nconception. The mark of that hybrid origin from mere conceptions is that\nthe author of a work of art could, before he set about it, give in\ndistinct words what he intended to present; for then it would have been\npossible to attain his whole end through these words. Therefore it is an\nundertaking as unworthy as it is absurd if, as has often been tried at the\npresent day, one seeks to reduce a poem of Shakspeare’s or Goethe’s to the\nabstract truth which it was its aim to communicate. Certainly the artist\nought to think in the arranging of his work; but only that thought which\nwas _perceived_ before it was thought has afterwards, in its\ncommunication, the power of animating or rousing, and thereby becomes\nimperishable. We shall not refrain from observing here that certainly the\nwork which is done at a stroke, like the sketches of painters already\nreferred to, the work which is completed in the inspiration of its first\nconception, and as it were unconsciously dashed off, like the melody which\ncomes entirely without reflection, and quite as if by inspiration, and\nfinally, also the lyrical poem proper, the mere song, in which the deeply\nfelt mood of the present, and the impression of the surroundings, as if\ninvoluntarily, pours itself forth in words, whose metre and rhyme come\nabout of their own accord—that all these, I say, have the great advantage\nof being purely the work of the ecstasy of the moment, the inspiration,\nthe free movement of genius, without any admixture of intention and\nreflection; hence they are through and through delightful and enjoyable,\nwithout shell and kernel, and their effect is much more inevitable than\nthat of the greatest works of art, of slower and more deliberate\nexecution. In all the latter, thus in great historical paintings, in long\nepic poems, great operas, &c., reflection, intention, and deliberate\nselection has had an important part; understanding, technical skill, and\nroutine must here fill up the gaps which the conception and inspiration of\ngenius has left, and must mix with these all kinds of necessary\nsupplementary work as cement of the only really genuinely brilliant parts.\nThis explains why all such works, only excepting the perfect masterpieces\nof the very greatest masters (as, for example, “Hamlet,” “Faust,” the\nopera of “Don Juan”), inevitably contain an admixture of something insipid\nand wearisome, which in some measure hinders the enjoyment of them. Proofs\nof this are the “Messiah,” “_Gerusalemme liberata_,” even “Paradise Lost”\nand the “Æneid;” and Horace already makes the bold remark, “_Quandoque\ndormitat bonus Homerus_.” But that this is the case is the consequence of\nthe limitation of human powers in general.\n\nThe mother of the useful arts is necessity; that of the fine arts\nsuperfluity. As their father, the former have understanding; the latter\ngenius, which is itself a kind of superfluity, that of the powers of\nknowledge beyond the measure which is required for the service of the\nwill.\n\nChapter XXXV.(19) On The Æsthetics Of Architecture.\n\nIn accordance with the deduction given in the text of the pure æsthetics\nof architecture from the lowest grades of the objectification of the will\nor of nature, the Ideas of which it seeks to bring to distinct perception,\nits one constant theme is _support and burden_, and its fundamental law is\nthat no burden shall be without sufficient support, and no support without\na suitable burden; consequently that the relation of these two shall be\nexactly the fitting one. The purest example of the carrying out of this\ntheme is the column and entablature. Therefore the order or columnar\narrangement has become, as it were, the thorough bass of the whole of\narchitecture. In column and entablature the support and the burden are\n_completely separated_; whereby the reciprocal action of the two and their\nrelation to each other becomes apparent. For certainly even every plain\nwall contains support and burden; but here the two are still fused\ntogether. All is here support and all is burden; hence there is no\næsthetic effect. This first appears through the separation, and takes\nplace in proportion to its degree. For between the row of columns and the\nplain wall there are many intermediate degrees. Even in the mere breaking\nup of the wall of a house by windows and doors one seeks at least to\nindicate that separation by flat projecting pilasters (_antæ_) with\ncapitals, which are inserted under the mouldings, nay, in case of need,\nare represented by mere painting, in order to indicate in some way the\nentablature and an order. Real pillars, and also consoles and supports of\nvarious kinds, realise more that pure separation of support and burden\nwhich is striven after throughout by architecture. In this respect, next\nto the column with the entablature, but as a special construction not\nimitating it, stands the vault with the pillar. The latter certainly is\nfar from attaining to the æsthetic effect of the former, because here the\nsupport and the burden are not _purely separated_, but are fused, passing\nover into each other. In the vault itself every stone is at once burden\nand support, and even the pillars, especially in groined vaulting, are, at\nleast apparently, held in position by the pressure of opposite arches; and\nalso just on account of this lateral pressure not only vaults but even\nmere arches ought not to rest upon columns, but require the massive four‐\ncornered pillars. In the row of columns alone is the separation complete,\nfor here the entablature appears as pure burden, the column as pure\nsupport. Accordingly the relation of the colonnade to the plain wall may\nbe compared to that which would exist between a scale ascending in regular\nintervals and a tone ascending little by little from the same depth to the\nsame height without gradation, which would produce a mere howl. For in the\none as in the other the material is the same, and the important difference\nproceeds entirely from the _pure separation_.\n\nMoreover, the support is not adapted to the burden when it is only\nsufficient to bear it, but when it can do this so conveniently and amply\nthat at the first glance we are quite at ease about it. Yet this\nsuperfluity of support must not exceed a certain degree; for otherwise we\nwill perceive support without burden, which is opposed to the æsthetic\nend. As a rule for determining that degree the ancients devised the line\nof equilibrium, which is got by carrying out the diminution of the\nthickness of the column as it ascends till it runs out into an acute\nangle, whereby the column becomes a cone; now every cross section will\nleave the lower part so strong that it is sufficient to support the upper\npart cut off. Commonly, however, one builds with twentyfold strength,\n_i.e._, one lays upon every support only 1/20th of the maximum it could\nbear. A glaring example of burden without support is presented to the eye\nby the balconies at the corners of many houses built in the elegant style\nof the present day. We do not see what supports them; they seem to hang\nsuspended, and disturb the mind.\n\nThat in Italy even the simplest and most unornamented buildings make an\næsthetic impression, while in Germany this is not the case, depends\nprincipally upon the fact that in Italy the roofs are very flat. A high\nroof is neither support nor burden, for its two halves mutually support\neach other, but the whole has no weight corresponding to its extension.\nTherefore it presents to the eye an extended mass which is entirely\nforeign to the æsthetic end, serves merely a useful end, consequently\ndisturbs the former, of which the theme is always only support and burden.\n\nThe form of the column has its sole ground in the fact that it affords the\nsimplest and most suitable support. In the twisted column\ninappropriateness appears as if with intentional perversity, and therefore\nshamelessness: hence good taste condemns it at the first glance. The four‐\ncornered pillar, since the diagonal exceeds the sides, has unequal\ndimensions of thickness which have no end as their motive, but are\noccasioned by the accident of greater feasibleness; and just on this\naccount it pleases us so very much less than the column. Even the\nhexagonal or octagonal pillar is more pleasing, because it approaches more\nnearly to the round column; for the form of the latter alone is\nexclusively determined by the end. It is, however, also so determined in\nall its other proportions, primarily in the relation of its thickness to\nits height, within the limits permitted by the difference of the three\ncolumnar orders. Therefore its diminution from the first third of its\nheight upwards, and also a slight increase of its thickness just at this\nplace (_entasis vitr._), depends upon the fact that the pressure of the\nburden is greatest there. It has hitherto been believed that this increase\nin thickness was peculiar to the Ionic and Corinthian columns alone, but\nrecent measurements have shown it also in the Doric columns, even at\nPæstum. Thus everything in the column, its thoroughly determined form, the\nproportion of its height to its thickness, of both to the intervals\nbetween the columns, and that of the whole series to the entablature and\nthe burden resting upon it, is the exactly calculated result of the\nrelation of the necessary support to the given burden. As the latter is\nuniformly distributed, so must also the support be; therefore groups of\ncolumns are tasteless. On the other hand, in the best Doric temples the\ncorner column comes somewhat nearer to the next ones, because the meeting\nof the entablatures at the corner increases the burden; and in this the\nprinciple of architecture expresses itself distinctly, that the structural\nrelations, _i.e._, the relations between support and burden, are the\nessential ones, to which the relations of symmetry, as subordinate, must\nat once give way. According to the weight of the whole burden generally\nwill the Doric or the two lighter orders of columns be chosen, for the\nfirst, not only by the greater thickness, but also by the closer position\nof the columns, which is essential to it, is calculated for heavier\nburdens, to which end also the almost crude simplicity of its capital is\nsuited. The capitals in general serve the end of showing visibly that the\ncolumns bear the entablature, and are not stuck in like pins; at the same\ntime they increase by means of their abacus the bearing surface. Since,\nthen, all the laws of columnar arrangement, and consequently also the form\nand proportion of the column, in all its parts and dimensions down to the\nsmallest details, follow from the thoroughly understood and consistently\ncarried out conception of the amply adequate support of a given burden,\nthus so far are determined _a priori_, it comes out clearly how perverse\nis the thought, so often repeated, that the stems of trees, or even (which\nunfortunately even “Vitruvius,” iv. 1, expresses) the human form has been\nthe prototype of the column. For if the form of the column were for\narchitecture a purely accidental one, taken from without, it could never\nappeal to us so harmoniously and satisfactorily whenever we behold it in\nits proper symmetry; nor, on the other hand, could every even slight\ndisproportion of it be felt at once by the fine and cultivated sense as\ndisagreeable and disturbing, like a false note in music. This is rather\nonly possible because, according to the given end and means, all the rest\nis essentially determined _a priori_, as in music, according to the given\nmelody and key, the whole harmony is essentially so determined. And, like\nmusic, architecture in general is also not an imitative art, although both\nare often falsely taken to be so.\n\nÆsthetic satisfaction, as was fully explained in the text, always depends\nupon the apprehension of a (Platonic) Idea. For architecture, considered\nmerely as a fine art, the Ideas of the lowest grades of nature, such as\ngravity, rigidity, and cohesion, are the peculiar theme; but not, as has\nhitherto been assumed, merely regular form, proportion, and symmetry,\nwhich, as something purely geometrical, properties of space, are not\nIdeas, and therefore cannot be the theme of a fine art. Thus in\narchitecture also they are of secondary origin, and have a subordinate\nsignificance, which I shall bring out immediately. If it were the task of\narchitecture as a fine art simply to exhibit these, then the model would\nhave the same effect as the finished work. But this is distinctly not the\ncase; on the contrary, the works of architecture, in order to act\næsthetically, absolutely must have a considerable size; nay, they can\nnever be too large, but may easily be too small. Indeed _ceteris paribus_\nthe æsthetic effect is in exact proportion to the size of the building,\nbecause only great masses make the action of gravitation apparent and\nimpressive in a high degree. But this confirms my view that the tendency\nand antagonism of those fundamental forces of nature constitute the\nspecial æsthetical material of architecture, which, according to its\nnature, requires large masses in order to become visible, and indeed\ncapable of being felt. The forms in architecture, as was shown above in\nthe case of the column, are primarily determined by the immediate\nstructural end of each part. But so far as this leaves anything\nundetermined, the law of the most perfect clearness to perception, thus\nalso of the easiest comprehensibility, comes in; for architecture has its\nexistence primarily in our spatial perception, and accordingly appeals to\nour _a priori_ faculty for this. But these qualities always result from\nthe greatest regularity of the forms and rationality of their relations.\nTherefore beautiful architecture selects only regular figures composed of\nstraight lines or regular curves, and also the bodies which result from\nthese, such as cubes, parallelopipeda, cylinders, spheres, pyramids, and\ncones; but as openings sometimes circles or ellipses, yet, as a rule,\nquadrates, and still oftener rectangles, the latter of thoroughly rational\nand very easily comprehended relation of their sides (not, for instance as\n6:7, but as 1:2, 2:3), finally also blind windows or niches of regular and\ncomprehensible proportions. For the same reason it will readily give to\nthe buildings themselves and their large parts a rational and easily\ncomprehended relation of height and breadth; for example, it will let the\nheight of a facade be half the breadth, and place the pillars so that\nevery three or four of them, with the intervals between them, will measure\na line which is equal to the height, thus will form a quadrate. The same\nprinciple of perceptibility and easy comprehension demands also that a\nbuilding should be easily surveyed. This introduces symmetry, which is\nfurther necessary to mark out the work as a whole, and to distinguish its\nessential from its accidental limitation; for sometimes, for example, it\nis only under the guidance of symmetry that one knows whether one has\nbefore one three buildings standing beside each other or only one. Thus\nonly by means of symmetry does a work of architecture at once announce\nitself as individual unity, and as the development of a central thought.\n\nNow although, as was cursorily shown above, architecture has by no means\nto imitate the forms of nature, such as the stems of trees or even the\nhuman figure, yet it ought to work in the spirit of nature, for it makes\nthe law its own, _natura nihil agit frustra, nihilque supervacaneum, et\nquod commodissimum in omnibus suis operationibus sequitur_, and\naccordingly avoids everything which is even only apparently aimless, and\nalways attains the end in view in each case, whether this is purely\narchitectonic, _i.e._, structural, or an end connected with usefulness, by\nthe shortest and most natural path, and thus openly exhibits the end\nthrough the work itself. Thus it attains a certain grace, analogous to\nthat which in living creatures consists in the ease and suitableness of\nevery movement and position to its end. Accordingly we see in the good\nantique style of architecture every part, whether pillar, column, arch,\nentablature, or door, window, stair, or balcony, attain its end in the\ndirectest and simplest manner, at the same time displaying it openly and\nnaively; just as organised nature also does in its works. The tasteless\nstyle of architecture, on the contrary, seeks in everything useless\nroundabout ways, and delights in caprices, thereby hits upon aimlessly\nbroken and irregular entablatures, grouped columns, fragmentary cornices\non door arches and gables, meaningless volutes, scrolls, and such like. It\nplays with the means of the art without understanding its aims, as\nchildren play with the tools of grown‐up people. This was given above as\nthe character of the bungler. Of this kind is every interruption of a\nstraight line, every alteration in the sweep of a curve, without apparent\nend. On the other hand, it is also just that naive simplicity in the\ndisclosure and attainment of the end, corresponding to the spirit in which\nnature works and fashions, that imparts such beauty and grace of form to\nantique pottery that it ever anew excites our wonder, because it contrasts\nso advantageously in original taste with our modern pottery, which bears\nthe stamp of vulgarity, whether it is made of porcelain or common potter’s\nclay. At the sight of the pottery and implements of the ancients we feel\nthat if nature had wished to produce such things it would have done so in\nthese forms. Since, then, we see that the beauty of architecture arises\nfrom the unconcealed exhibition of the ends, and the attainment of them by\nthe shortest and most natural path, my theory here appears in direct\ncontradiction with that of Kant, which places the nature of all beauty in\nan apparent design without an end.\n\nThe sole theme of architecture here set forth—support and burden—is so\nvery simple, that just on this account this art, so far as it is a fine\nart (but not so far as it serves useful ends), is perfect and complete in\nessential matters, since the best Greek period, at least, is not\nsusceptible of any important enrichment. On the other hand, the modern\narchitect cannot noticeably depart from the rules and patterns of the\nancients without already being on the path of deterioration. Therefore\nthere remains nothing for him to do but to apply the art transmitted to\nhim by the ancients, and carry out the rules so far as is possible under\nthe limitations which are inevitably laid down for him by wants, climate,\nage, and country. For in this art, as in sculpture, the effort after the\nideal unites with the imitation of the ancients.\n\nI scarcely need to remind the reader that in all these considerations I\nhave had in view antique architecture alone, and not the so‐called Gothic\nstyle, which is of Saracen origin, and was introduced by the Goths in\nSpain to the rest of Europe. Perhaps a certain beauty of its own kind is\nnot altogether to be denied to this style, but yet if it attempts to\noppose itself to the former as its equal, then this is a barbarous\npresumption which must not be allowed for a moment. How beneficently,\nafter contemplating such Gothic magnificence, does the sight of a building\ncorrectly carried out in the antique style act upon our mind! We feel at\nonce that this alone is right and true. If one could bring an ancient\nGreek before our most celebrated Gothic cathedrals, what would he say to\nthem?—Βαρβαροι! Our pleasure in Gothic works certainly depends for the\nmost part upon the association of ideas and historical reminiscences, thus\nupon a feeling which is foreign to art. All that I have said of the true\næsthetic end, of the spirit and the theme of architecture, loses in the\ncase of these works its validity. For the freely lying entablature has\nvanished, and with it the columns: support and burden, arranged and\ndistributed in order to give visible form to the conflict between rigidity\nand gravity, are here no longer the theme. Moreover, that thorough, pure\nrationality by virtue of which everything admits of strict account, nay,\nalready presents it of its own accord to the thoughtful beholder, and\nwhich belongs to the character of antique architecture, can here no longer\nbe found; we soon become conscious that here, instead of it, a will guided\nby other conceptions has moved; therefore much remains unexplained to us.\nFor only the antique style of architecture is conceived in a purely\n_objective_ spirit; the Gothic style is more in the subjective spirit. Yet\nas we have recognised the peculiar æsthetic fundamental thought of antique\narchitecture in the unfolding of the conflict between rigidity and\ngravity, if we wish to discover in Gothic architecture also an analogous\nfundamental thought, it will be this, that here the entire overcoming and\nconquest of gravity by rigidity is supposed to be exhibited. For in\naccordance with this the horizontal line which is that of burden has\nentirely vanished, and the action of gravity only appears indirectly,\ndisguised in arches and vaults, while the vertical line which is that of\nsupport, alone prevails, and makes palpable to the senses the victorious\naction of rigidity, in excessively high buttresses, towers, turrets, and\npinnacles without number which rise unencumbered on high. While in antique\narchitecture the tendency and pressure from above downwards is just as\nwell represented and exhibited as that from below upwards, here the latter\ndecidedly predominates; whence that analogy often observed with the\ncrystal, whose crystallisation also takes place with the overcoming of\ngravity. If now we attribute this spirit and fundamental thought to Gothic\narchitecture, and would like thereby to set it up as the equally justified\nantithesis of antique architecture, we must remember that the conflict\nbetween rigidity and gravity, which the antique architecture so openly and\nnaïvely expresses, is an actual and true conflict founded in nature; the\nentire overcoming of gravity by rigidity, on the contrary, remains a mere\nappearance, a fiction accredited by illusion. Every one will easily be\nable to see clearly how from the fundamental thought given here, and the\npeculiarities of Gothic architecture noticed above, there arises that\nmysterious and hyperphysical character which is attributed to it. It\nprincipally arises, as was already mentioned, from the fact that here the\narbitrary has taken the place of the purely rational, which makes itself\nknown as the thorough adaptation of the means to the end. The many things\nthat are really aimless, but yet are so carefully perfected, raise the\nassumption of unknown, unfathomed, and secret ends, _i.e._, give the\nappearance of mystery. On the other hand, the brilliant side of Gothic\nchurches is the interior; because here the effect of the groined vaulting\nborne by slender, crystalline, aspiring pillars, raised high aloft, and,\nall burden having disappeared, promising eternal security, impresses the\nmind; while most of the faults which have been mentioned lie upon the\noutside. In antique buildings the external side is the most advantageous,\nbecause there we see better the support and the burden; in the interior,\non the other hand, the flat roof always retains something depressing and\nprosaic. For the most part, also, in the temples of the ancients, while\nthe outworks were many and great, the interior proper was small. An\nappearance of sublimity is gained from the hemispherical vault of a\ncupola, as in the Pantheon, of which, therefore, the Italians also,\nbuilding in this style, have made a most extensive use. What determines\nthis is, that the ancients, as southern peoples, lived more in the open\nair than the northern nations who have produced the Gothic style of\narchitecture. Whoever, then, absolutely insists upon Gothic architecture\nbeing accepted as an essential and authorised style may, if he is also\nfond of analogies, regard it as the negative pole of architecture, or,\nagain, as its minor key. In the interest of good taste I must wish that\ngreat wealth will be devoted to that which is objectively, _i.e._,\nactually, good and right, to what in itself is beautiful, but not to that\nwhose value depends merely upon the association of ideas. Now when I see\nhow this unbelieving age so diligently finishes the Gothic churches left\nincomplete by the believing Middle Ages, it looks to me as if it were\ndesired to embalm a dead Christianity.\n\nChapter XXXVI.(20) Isolated Remarks On The Æsthetics Of The Plastic And\nPictorial Arts.\n\nIn sculpture beauty and grace are the principal things; but in painting\nexpression, passion, and character predominate; therefore just so much of\nthe claims of beauty must be neglected. For a perfect beauty of all forms,\nsuch as sculpture demands, would detract from the characteristic and weary\nby monotony. Accordingly painting may also present ugly faces and\nemaciated figures; sculpture, on the other hand, demands beauty, although\nnot always perfect, but, throughout, strength and fulness of the figures.\nConsequently a thin Christ upon the Cross, a dying St. Jerome, wasted by\nage and disease, like the masterpiece of Domenichino, is a proper subject\nfor painting; while, on the contrary, the marble figure by Donatello, in\nthe gallery at Florence, of John the Baptist, reduced to skin and bone by\nfasting, has, in spite of the masterly execution, a repulsive effect. From\nthis point of view sculpture seems suitable for the affirmation, painting\nfor the negation, of the will to live, and from this it may be explained\nwhy sculpture was the art of the ancients, while painting has been the art\nof the Christian era.\n\nIn connection with the exposition given in § 45 of the first volume, that\nthe discovery, recognition, and retention of the type of human beauty\ndepends to a certain extent upon an anticipation of it, and therefore in\npart has an _a priori_ foundation, I find that I have yet to bring out\nclearly the fact that this anticipation nevertheless requires experience,\nby which it may be stirred up; analogous to the instinct of the brutes,\nwhich, although guiding the action _a priori_, yet requires determination\nby motives in the details of it. Experience and reality present to the\nintellect of the artist human forms, which, in one part or another, are\nmore or less true to nature, as if it were asking for his judgment\nconcerning them, and thus, after the Socratic method, call forth from that\nobscure anticipation the distinct and definite knowledge of the ideal.\nTherefore it assisted the Greek sculptors very much that the climate and\ncustoms of their country gave them opportunity the whole day of seeing\nhalf‐naked forms, and in the gymnasium entirely naked forms. In this way\nevery limb presented its plastic significance to criticism, and to\ncomparison with the ideal which lay undeveloped in their consciousness.\nThus they constantly exercised their judgment with regard to all forms and\nlimbs, down to their finest shades of difference; and thus, little by\nlittle, their originally dull anticipation of the ideal of human beauty\nwas raised to such distinct consciousness that they became capable of\nobjectifying it in works of art. In an entirely analogous manner some\nexperience is useful and necessary to the poet for the representation of\ncharacters. For although he does not work according to experience and\nempirical data, but in accordance with the clear consciousness of the\nnature of humanity, as he finds it within himself, yet experience serves\nthis consciousness as a pattern, incites it and gives it practice.\nAccordingly his knowledge of human nature and its varieties, although in\nthe main it proceeds _a priori_ and by anticipation, yet first receives\nlife, definiteness, and compass through experience. But, supporting\nourselves upon the preceding book and chapter 44 in the following book, we\ncan go still deeper into the ground of that marvellous sense of beauty of\nthe Greeks which made them alone of all nations upon earth capable of\ndiscovering the true normal type of the human form, and accordingly of\nsetting up the pattern of beauty and grace for the imitation of all ages,\nand we can say: The same thing which, if it remains unseparated from the\n_will_, gives sexual instinct with its discriminating selection, _i.e._,\n_sexual love_ (which it is well known was subject among the Greeks to\ngreat aberrations), becomes, if, by the presence of an abnormally\npreponderating intellect, it separates itself from the will and yet\nremains active, _the objective sense of beauty_ of the human form, which\nnow shows itself primarily as a critical artistic sense, but can rise to\nthe discovery and representation of the norm of all parts and proportions;\nas was the case in Phidias, Praxiteles, Scopas, &c. Then is fulfilled what\nGoethe makes the artist say—\n\n    “That I with mind divine\n    And human hand\n    May be able to form\n    What with my wife,\n    As animal, I can and must.”\n\nAnd again, analogous to this, that which in the poet, if it remained\nunseparated from the will, would give only worldly prudence, becomes, if\nit frees itself from the will by abnormal preponderance of the intellect,\nthe capacity for objective, dramatic representation.\n\nModern sculpture, whatever it may achieve, is still analogous to modern\nLatin poetry, and, like this, is a child of imitation, sprung from\nreminiscences. If it presumes to try to be original, it at once goes\nastray, especially upon the bad path of forming according to nature as it\nlies before it, instead of according to the proportions of the ancients.\nCanova, Thorwaldsen, and many others may be compared to Johannes Secundus\nand Owenus. It is the same with architecture, only there it is founded in\nthe art itself, the purely æsthetic part of which is of small compass, and\nwas already exhausted by the ancients; therefore the modern architect can\nonly distinguish himself in the wise application of it; and he ought to\nknow that he removes himself from good taste just so far as he departs\nfrom the style and pattern of the Greeks.\n\nThe art of the painter, considered only so far as it aims at producing the\nappearance of reality, may ultimately be referred to the fact that he\nunderstands how to separate purely what in seeing is the mere sensation,\nthus the affection of the retina, _i.e._, the only directly given\n_effect_, from its _cause_, _i.e._, the objective external world, the\nperception of which first rises in the understanding from this effect;\nwhereby, if he has technical skill, he is in a position to produce the\nsame effect in the eye through an entirely different cause, the patches of\napplied colour, from which then in the understanding of the beholder the\nsame perception again arises through the unavoidable reference of the\neffect to the ordinary cause.\n\nIf we consider how there lies something so entirely idiosyncratic, so\nthoroughly original, in every human countenance, and that it presents a\nwhole which can only belong to a unity consisting entirely of necessary\nparts by virtue of which we recognise a known individual out of so many\nthousands, even after long years, although the possible variations of\nhuman features, especially of one race, lie within very narrow limits, we\nmust doubt whether anything of such essential unity and such great\noriginality could ever proceed from any other source than from the\nmysterious depths of the inner being of nature; but from this it would\nfollow that no artist could be capable of really reproducing the original\npeculiarity of a human countenance, or even of composing it according to\nnature from recollection. Accordingly what he produced of this kind would\nalways be only a half true, nay, perhaps an impossible composition; for\nhow should he compose an actual physiognomical unity when the principle of\nthis unity is really unknown to him? Therefore, in the case of every face\nwhich has merely been imagined by an artist, we must doubt whether it is\nin fact a possible face, and whether nature, as the master of all masters,\nwould not show it to be a bungled production by pointing out complete\ncontradictions in it. This would, of course, lead to the principle that in\nhistorical paintings only portraits ought to figure, which certainly would\nthen have to be selected with the greatest care and in some degree\nidealised. It is well known that great artists have always gladly painted\nfrom living models and introduced many portraits.\n\nAlthough, as is explained in the text, the real end of painting, as of art\nin general, is to make the comprehension of the (Platonic) Ideas of the\nnature of the world easier for us, whereby we are at once thrown into the\nstate of pure, _i.e._, will‐less, knowing, there yet belongs to it besides\nthis an independent beauty of its own, which is produced by the mere\nharmony of the colours, the pleasingness of the grouping, the happy\ndistribution of light and shade, and the tone of the whole picture. This\naccompanying subordinate kind of beauty furthers the condition of pure\nknowing, and is in painting what the diction, the metre, and rhyme are in\npoetry; both are not what is essential, but what acts first and\nimmediately.\n\nI have some further evidence to give in support of my judgment given in\nthe first volume, § 50, on the inadmissibleness of allegory in painting.\nIn the Borghese palace at Rome there is the following picture by Michael\nAngelo Caravaggio: Jesus, as a child of about ten years old, treads upon\nthe head of a serpent, but entirely without fear and with great calmness;\nand His mother, who accompanies Him, remains quite as indifferent. Close\nby stands St. Elizabeth, looking solemnly and tragically up to heaven. Now\nwhat could be thought of this kyriological hieroglyphic by a man who had\nnever heard anything about the seed of the woman that should bruise the\nhead of the serpent? At Florence, in the library of the palace Riccardi,\nwe find the following allegory upon the ceiling, painted by Luca Giordano,\nwhich is meant to signify that science frees the understanding from the\nbonds of ignorance: the understanding is a strong man bound with cords,\nwhich are just falling off; a nymph holds a mirror in front of him,\nanother hands him a large detached wing; above sits science on a globe,\nand beside her, with a globe in her hand, the naked truth. At Ludwigsburg,\nnear Stuttgart, there is a picture which shows us time, as Saturn, cutting\noff with a pair of shears the wings of Cupid. If this is meant to signify\nthat when we grow old love proves unstable, this no doubt has its truth.\n\nThe following may serve to strengthen my solution of the problem as to why\nLaocoon does not cry out. One may practically convince oneself of the\nfaulty effect of the representation of shrieking by the works of the\nplastic and pictorial arts, which are essentially dumb, by a picture of\nthe slaughter of the innocents, by Guido Reni, which is to be found in the\nAcademy of Arts at Bologna, and in which this great artist has committed\nthe mistake of painting six shrieking wide‐open mouths. Let any one who\nwants to have this more distinct think of a pantomimic representation on\nthe stage, and in one of the scenes an urgent occasion for one of the\nplayers to shriek; if now the dancer who is representing this part should\nexpress the shriek by standing for a while with his mouth wide open, the\nloud laughter of the whole house would bear witness to the absurdity of\nthe thing. Accordingly, since the shrieking of Laocoon had to be avoided\nfor reasons which did not lie in the objects to be represented, but in the\nnature of the representing art, the task thus arose for the artist so to\npresent this not‐shrieking as to make it plausible to us that a man in\nsuch a position should not shriek. He solves this problem by representing\nthe bite of the snake, not as having already taken place, nor yet as still\nthreatening, but as just happening now in the side; for thereby the lower\npart of the body is contracted, and shrieking made impossible. This\nimmediate but only subordinate reason was correctly discovered by Goethe,\nand is expounded at the end of the eleventh book of his autobiography, and\nalso in the paper on Laocoon in the first part of the Propylæa; but the\nultimate, primary reason, which conditions this one, is that which I have\nset forth. I cannot refrain from remarking that I here stand in the same\nrelation to Goethe as with reference to the theory of colours. In the\ncollection of the Duke of Aremberg at Brussels there is an antique head of\nLaocoon which was found later. However, the head in the world‐renowned\ngroup is not a restored one which follows from Goethe’s special table of\nall the restorations of this group, which is given at the end of the first\nvolume of the Propylæa, and is also confirmed by the fact that the head\nwhich was found later resembles that of the group very much. Thus we must\nassume that another antique repetition of the group has existed to which\nthe Aremberg head belonged. In my opinion the latter excels both in beauty\nand expression that of the group. It has the mouth decidedly wider open\nthan in the group, yet not really to the extent of shrieking.\n\nChapter XXXVII.(21) On The Æsthetics Of Poetry.\n\nI might give it as the simplest and most correct definition of poetry,\nthat it is the art of bringing the imagination into play by means of\nwords. How it brings this to pass I have shown in the first volume,",

    "page_content": "A special confirmation of what is said there is afforded by the following\npassage in a letter of Wieland’s to Merck, which has since then been\npublished: “I have spent two days and a half upon a single stanza, in\nwhich the whole thing ultimately depended upon a single word which I\nwanted and could not find. I revolved and turned about the thing and my\nbrain in all directions, because naturally, where a picture was in\nquestion, I desired to bring the same definite vision, which floated\nbefore my own mind into the mind of my reader also, and for this all often\ndepends, _ut nosti_, upon a single touch or suggestion or reflex” (_Briefe\nan Merck_, edited by Wagner, 1835, p. 193). From the fact that the\nimagination of the reader is the material in which poetry exhibits its\npictures, it has the advantage that the fuller development of these\npictures and their finer touches, take place in the imagination of every\none just as is most suitable to his individuality, his sphere of\nknowledge, and his humour, and therefore move him in the most lively\nmanner; instead of which plastic and pictorial art cannot so adapt itself,\nbut here _one_ picture, _one_ form, must satisfy all. And yet this will\nalways bear in some respect the stamp of the individuality of the artist\nor of his model, as a subjective or accidental and inefficient addition;\nalthough always less so the more objective, _i.e._, the more of a genius,\nthe artist is. This, to some extent, explains why works of poetry exercise\na much stronger, deeper, and more universal effect than pictures and\nstatues; the latter, for the most part, leave the common people quite\ncold; and, in general, the plastic arts are those which have the weakest\neffect. A remarkable proof of this is afforded by the frequent discovery\nand disclosure of pictures by great masters in private houses and all\nkinds of localities, where they have been hanging for many generations,\nnot buried and concealed, but merely unheeded, thus without any effect. In\nmy time (1823) there was even discovered in Florence a Madonna of\nRaphael’s, which had hung for a long series of years on the wall of the\nservants’ hall of a palace (in the _Quartiere di S. Spirito_); and this\nhappens among Italians, the nation which is gifted beyond all others with\nthe sense of the beautiful. It shows how little direct and immediate\neffect the works of plastic and pictorial art have, and that it requires\nmore culture and knowledge to prize them than the works of all other arts.\nHow unfailingly, on the contrary, a beautiful melody that touches the\nheart makes its journey round the world, and an excellent poem wanders\nfrom people to people. That the great and rich devote their powerful\nsupport just to the plastic and pictorial arts, and expend considerable\nsums upon _their_ works only; nay, at the present day, an idolatry, in the\nproper sense of the term, gives the value of a large estate for a picture\nof a celebrated old master—this depends principally upon the rarity of the\nmasterpieces, the possession of which therefore gratifies pride; and then\nalso upon the fact that the enjoyment of them demands very little time and\neffort, and is ready at any moment, for a moment; while poetry and even\nmusic make incomparably harder conditions. Corresponding to this, the\nplastic and pictorial arts may be dispensed with; whole nations—for\nexample, the Mohammedan peoples—are without them, but no people is without\nmusic and poetry.\n\nBut the intention with which the poet sets our imagination in motion is to\nreveal to us the Ideas, _i.e._, to show us by an example what life and\nwhat the world is. The first condition of this is that he himself has\nknown it; according as his knowledge has been profound or superficial so\nwill his poem be. Therefore, as there are innumerable degrees of\nprofoundness and clearness in the comprehension of the nature of things,\nso are there of poets. Each of these, however, must regard himself as\nexcellent so far as he has correctly represented what he knew, and his\npicture answers to _his_ original: he must make himself equal with the\nbest, for even in the best picture he does not recognise more than in his\nown, that is, as much as he sees in nature itself; for his glance cannot\nnow penetrate deeper. But the best himself recognises himself as such in\nthe fact that he sees how superficial was the view of the others, how much\nlay beyond it which they were not able to repeat, because they did not see\nit, and how much further his own glance and picture reaches. If he\nunderstood the superficial poets as little as they do him, then he would\nnecessarily despair; for just because it requires an extraordinary man to\ndo him justice, but the inferior poets can just as little esteem him as he\ncan them, he also has long to live upon his own approval before that of\nthe world follows it. Meanwhile he is deprived even of his own approval,\nfor he is expected to be very modest. It is, however, as impossible that\nhe who has merit, and knows what it costs, should himself be blind to it,\nas that a man who is six feet high should not observe that he rises above\nothers. If from the base of the tower to the summit is 300 feet, then\ncertainly it is just as much from the summit to the base. Horace,\nLucretius, Ovid, and almost all the ancients have spoken proudly of\nthemselves, and also Dante, Shakspeare, Bacon of Verulam, and many more.\nThat one can be a great man without observing anything of it is an\nabsurdity of which only hopeless incapacity can persuade itself, in order\nthat it may regard the feeling of its own insignificance as modesty. An\nEnglishman has wittily and correctly observed that merit and modesty have\nnothing in common except the initial letter.(22) I have always a suspicion\nabout modest celebrities that they may very well be right; and Corneille\nsays directly—\n\n    “La fausse humilité ne met plus en crédit:\n    Je sçais ce que je vaux, et crois ce qu’on m’en dit.”\n\nFinally, Goethe has frankly said, “Only good‐for‐nothings are modest.” But\nthe assertion would be still more certain that those who so eagerly demand\nmodesty from others, urge modesty, unceasingly cry, “Only be modest, for\nGod’s sake, only be modest!” are positively good‐for‐nothings, _i.e._,\npersons entirely without merit, manufactures of nature, ordinary members\nof the great mass of humanity. For he who himself has merit also concedes\nmerit—understands himself truly and really. But he who himself lacks all\nexcellence and merit wishes there was no such thing: the sight of it in\nothers stretches him upon the rack; pale, green, and yellow envy consumes\nhis heart: he would like to annihilate and destroy all those who are\npersonally favoured; but if unfortunately he must let them live, it must\nonly be under the condition that they conceal, entirely deny, nay, abjure\ntheir advantages. This, then, is the root of the frequent eulogising of\nmodesty. And if the deliverers of these eulogies have the opportunity of\nsuppressing merit as it arises, or at least of hindering it from showing\nitself or being known, who can doubt that they will do it? For this is the\npractice of their theory.\n\nNow, although the poet, like every artist, always brings before us only\nthe particular, the individual, what he has known, and wishes by his work\nto make us know, is the (Platonic) Idea, the whole species; therefore in\nhis images, as it were, the type of human characters and situations will\nbe impressed. The narrative and also the dramatic poet takes the whole\nparticular from life, and describes it accurately in its individuality,\nbut yet reveals in this way the whole of human existence; for although he\nseems to have to do with the particular, in truth he is concerned with\nthat which is everywhere and at all times. Hence it arises that sentences,\nespecially of the dramatic poets, even without being general apophthegms,\nfind frequent application in actual life. Poetry is related to philosophy\nas experience is related to empirical science. Experience makes us\nacquainted with the phenomenon in the particular and by means of examples,\nscience embraces the whole of phenomena by means of general conceptions.\nSo poetry seeks to make us acquainted with the (Platonic) Ideas through\nthe particular and by means of examples. Philosophy aims at teaching, as a\nwhole and in general, the inner nature of things which expresses itself in\nthese. One sees even here that poetry bears more the character of youth,\nphilosophy that of old age. In fact, the gift of poetry really only\nflourishes in youth; and also the susceptibility for poetry is often\npassionate in youth: the youth delights in verses as such, and is often\ncontented with small ware. This inclination gradually diminishes with\nyears, and in old age one prefers prose. By that poetical tendency of\nyouth the sense of the real is then easily spoiled. For poetry differs\nfrom reality by the fact that in it life flows past us, interesting and\nyet painless; while in reality, on the contrary, so long as it is painless\nit is uninteresting, and as soon as it becomes interesting, it does not\nremain without pain. The youth who has been initiated into poetry earlier\nthan into reality now desires from the latter what only the former can\nachieve; this is a principal source of the discomfort which oppresses the\nmost gifted youths.\n\nMetre and rhyme are a fetter, but also a veil which the poet throws round\nhim, and under which he is permitted to speak as he otherwise dared not\ndo; and that is what gives us pleasure. He is only half responsible for\nall that he says; metre and rhyme must answer for the other half. Metre,\nor measure, as mere rhythm, has its existence only in time, which is a\npure perception _a priori_, thus, to use Kant’s language, belongs merely\nto _pure sensibility_; rhyme, on the other hand, is an affair of\nsensation, in the organ of hearing, thus of _empirical sensibility_.\nTherefore rhythm is a much nobler and more worthy expedient than rhyme,\nwhich the ancients accordingly despised, and which found its origin in\nthose imperfect languages which arose from the corruption of earlier ones\nand in barbarous times. The poorness of French poetry depends principally\nupon the fact that it is confined to rhyme alone without metre, and it is\nincreased by the fact that in order to conceal its want of means it has\nincreased the difficulty of rhyming by a number of pedantic laws, such as,\nfor example, that only syllables which are written the same way rhyme, as\nif it were for the eye and not for the ear that the hiatus is forbidden;\nthat a number of words must not occur; and many such, to all of which the\nnew school of French poetry seeks to put an end. In no language, however,\nat least on me, does the rhyme make such a pleasing and powerful\nimpression as in Latin; the rhymed Latin poems of the Middle Ages have a\npeculiar charm. This must be explained from the fact that the Latin\nlanguage is incomparably more perfect, more beautiful and noble, than any\nmodern language, and now moves so gracefully in the ornaments and spangles\nwhich really belong to the latter, and which it itself originally\ndespised.\n\nTo serious consideration it might almost appear as high treason against\nour reason that even the slightest violence should be done to a thought or\nits correct and pure expression, with the childish intention that after\nsome syllables the same sound of word should be heard, or even that these\nsyllables themselves should present a kind of rhythmical beat. But without\nsuch violence very few verses would be made; for it must be attributed to\nthis that in foreign languages verses are much more difficult to\nunderstand than prose. If we could see into the secret workshops of the\npoets, we would find that the thought is sought for the rhyme ten times\noftener than the rhyme for the thought; and even when the latter is the\ncase, it is not easily accomplished without pliability on the part of the\nthought. But the art of verse bids defiance to these considerations, and,\nmoreover, has all ages and peoples upon its side, so great is the power\nwhich metre and rhyme exercise upon the feeling, and so effective the\nmysterious _lenocinium_ which belongs to them. I would explain this from\nthe fact that a happily rhymed verse, by its indescribably emphatic\neffect, raises the feeling as if the thought expressed in it lay already\npredestined, nay, performed in the language, and the poet has only had to\nfind it out. Even trivial thoughts receive from rhythm and rhyme a touch\nof importance; cut a figure in this attire, as among girls plain faces\nattract the eye by finery. Nay, even distorted and false thoughts gain\nthrough versification an appearance of truth. On the other hand, even\nfamous passages from famous poets shrink together and become insignificant\nwhen they are reproduced accurately in prose. If only the true is\nbeautiful, and the dearest ornament of truth is nakedness, then a thought\nwhich appears true and beautiful in prose will have more true worth than\none which affects us in the same way in verse. Now it is very striking,\nand well worth investigating, that such trifling, nay, apparently\nchildish, means as metre and rhyme produce so powerful an effect. I\nexplain it to myself in the following manner: That which is given directly\nto the sense of hearing, thus the mere sound of the words, receives from\nrhythm and rhyme a certain completeness and significance in itself for it\nthereby becomes a kind of music; therefore it seems now to exist for its\nown sake, and no longer as a mere means, mere signs of something\nsignified, the sense of the words. To please the ear with its sound seems\nto be its whole end, and therefore with this everything seems to be\nattained and all claims satisfied. But that it further contains a meaning,\nexpresses a thought, presents itself now as an unexpected addition, like\nwords to music—as an unexpected present which agreeably surprises us—and\ntherefore, since we made no demands of this kind, very easily satisfies\nus; and if indeed this thought is such that, in itself, thus said in\nprose, it would also be significant, then we are enchanted. I can\nremember, in my early childhood, that I had delighted myself for a long\ntime with the agreeable sound of verse before I made the discovery that it\nall also contained meaning and thoughts. Accordingly there is also, in all\nlanguages, a mere doggerel poetry almost entirely devoid of meaning.\nDavis, the Sinologist, in the \n\nThe sign by which one most immediately recognises the genuine poet, both\nof the higher and lower species, is the unforced nature of his rhymes.\nThey have appeared of themselves as if by divine arrangement; his thoughts\ncome to him already in rhyme. The homely, prosaic man on the contrary,\nseeks the rhyme for the thought; the bungler seeks the thought for the\nrhyme. Very often one can find out from a couple of rhymed verses which of\nthe two had the thought and which had the rhyme as its father. The art\nconsists in concealing the latter, so that such lines may not appear\nalmost as mere stuffed out _boutsrimés_.\n\nAccording to my feeling (proofs cannot here be given) rhyme is from its\nnature binary: its effect is limited to one single recurrence of the same\nsound, and is not strengthened by more frequent repetition. Thus whenever\na final syllable has received the one of the same sound its effect is\nexhausted; the third recurrence of the note acts merely as a second rhyme\nwhich accidentally hits upon the same sound, but without heightening the\neffect; it links itself on to the existing rhyme, yet without combining\nwith it to produce a stronger impression. For the first note does not\nsound through the second on to the third: therefore this is an æsthetic\npleonasm, a double courage which is of no use. Least of all, therefore, do\nsuch accumulations of rhymes merit the heavy sacrifices which they cost in\nthe octave rhyme, the terza rima, and the sonnet, and which are the cause\nof the mental torture under which we sometimes read such productions, for\npoetical pleasure is impossible under the condition of racking our brains.\nThat the great poetical mind sometimes overcomes even these forms, and\nmoves in them with ease and grace, does not extend to a recommendation of\nthe forms themselves, for in themselves they are as ineffectual as they\nare difficult. And even in good poets, when they make use of these forms,\nwe frequently see the conflict between the rhyme and the thought, in which\nnow one and now the other gains the victory; thus either the thought is\nstunted for the sake of the rhyme, or the rhyme has to be satisfied with a\nweak _à peu près_. Since this is so, I do not regard it as an evidence of\nignorance, but as a proof of good taste, that Shakspeare in his sonnets\nhas given different rhymes to each quatraine. At any rate, their acoustic\neffect is not in the least diminished by it, and the thought obtains its\nrights far more than it could have done if it had had to be laced up in\nthe customary Spanish boots.\n\nIt is a disadvantage for the poetry of a language if it has many words\nwhich cannot be used in prose, and, on the other hand, dare not use\ncertain words of prose. The former is mostly the case in Latin and Italian\npoetry, and the latter in French, where it has recently been very aptly\ncalled, “_La bégeulerie de la langue française_;” both are to be found\nless in English, and least in German. For such words belonging exclusively\nto poetry remain foreign to our heart, do not speak to us directly, and\ntherefore leave us cold. They are a conventional language of poetry, and\nas it were mere painted sensations instead of real ones: they exclude\ngenuine feeling.\n\nThe distinction, so often discussed in our own day, between _classic_ and\n_romantic_ poetry seems to me ultimately to depend upon the fact that the\nformer knows no other motives than those which are purely human, actual,\nand natural; the latter, on the other hand, also treats artificial\nconventional, and imaginary motives as efficient. To such belong the\nmotives which spring from the Christian mythus, also from the chivalrous\nover‐strained fantastical law of honour, further from the absurd and\nludicrous Germano‐Christian veneration of women, and lastly from doting\nand mooning hyperphysical amorousness. But even in the best poets of the\nromantic class, _e.g._, in Calderon, we can see to what ridiculous\ndistortions of human relations and human nature these motives lead. Not to\nspeak of the Autos, I merely refer to such pieces as “_No siempre el peor\nes cierto_” (The worst is not always certain), and “_El postrero duelo en\nEspaña_” (The last duel in Spain), and similar comedies _en capa y\nespada_: with the elements mentioned there is here further associated the\nscholastic subtility so often appearing in the conversation which at that\ntime belonged to the mental culture of the higher classes. How decidedly\nadvantageous, on the contrary, is the position of the poetry of the\nancients, which always remains true to nature; and the result is that\nclassical poetry has an unconditional, romantic poetry only a conditional,\ntruth and correctness; analogous to Greek and Gothic architecture. Yet, on\nthe other hand, we must remark here that all dramatic or narrative poems\nwhich transfer their scene to ancient Greece or Rome lose by this from the\nfact that our knowledge of antiquity, especially in what concerns the\ndetails of life, is insufficient, fragmentary, and not drawn from\nperception. This obliges the poet to avoid much and to content himself\nwith generalities, whereby he becomes abstract, and his work loses that\nconcreteness and individualisation which is throughout essential to\npoetry. It is this which gives all such works the peculiar appearance of\nemptiness and tediousness. Only Shakspeare’s works of this kind are free\nfrom it; because without hesitation he has presented, under the names of\nGreeks and Romans, Englishmen of his own time.\n\nIt has been objected to many masterpieces of lyrical poetry, especially\nsome Odes of Horace (see, for example, the second of the third book) and\nseveral of Goethe’s songs (for example, “The Shepherd’s Lament”), that\nthey lack proper connection and are full of gaps in the thought. But here\nthe logical connection is intentionally neglected, in order that the unity\nof the fundamental sensation and mood may take its place, which comes out\nmore clearly just by the fact that it passes like a thread through the\nseparate pearls, and brings about the quick changes of the objects of\ncontemplation, in the same way as in music the transition from one key to\nanother is brought about by the chord of the seventh, through which the\nstill sounding fundamental note becomes the dominant of the new key. Most\ndistinctly, even exaggeratedly, the quality here described is found in the\nCanzone of Petrarch which begins, “_Mai non vo’ più cantar, com’ io\nsoleva_.”\n\nAccordingly, as in the lyrical poem the subjective element predominates,\nso in the drama, on the contrary, the objective element is alone and\nexclusively present. Between the two epic poetry in all its forms and\nmodifications, from the narrative romance to the epos proper, has a broad\nmiddle path. For although in the main it is objective, yet it contains a\nsubjective element, appearing now more and now less, which finds its\nexpression in the tone, in the form of the delivery, and also in scattered\nreflections. We do not so entirely lose sight of the poet as in the drama.\n\nThe end of the drama in general is to show us in an example what is the\nnature and existence of man. The sad or the bright side of these can be\nturned to us in it, or their transitions into each other. But the\nexpression, “nature and existence of man,” already contains the germ of\nthe controversy whether the nature, _i.e._, the character, or the\nexistence, _i.e._, the fate, the adventures, the action, is the principal\nthing. Moreover, the two have grown so firmly together that although they\ncan certainly be separated in conception, they cannot be separated in the\nrepresentation of them. For only the circumstances, the fate, the events,\nmake the character manifest its nature, and only from the character does\nthe action arise from which the events proceed. Certainly, in the\nrepresentation, the one or the other may be made more prominent; and in\nthis respect the piece which centres in the characters and the piece which\ncentres in the plot are the two extremes.\n\nThe common end of the drama and the epic, to exhibit, in significant\ncharacters placed in significant situations, the extraordinary actions\nbrought about by both, will be most completely attained by the poet if he\nfirst introduces the characters to us in a state of peace, in which merely\ntheir general colour becomes visible, and allows a motive to enter which\nproduces an action, out of which a new and stronger motive arises, which\nagain calls forth a more significant action, which, in its turn, begets\nnew and even stronger motives, whereby, then, in the time suitable to the\nform of the poem, the most passionate excitement takes the place of the\noriginal peace, and in this now the important actions occur in which the\nqualities of the characters which have hitherto slumbered are brought\nclearly to light, together with the course of the world.\n\nGreat poets transform themselves into each of the persons to be\nrepresented, and speak out of each of them like ventriloquists; now out of\nthe hero, and immediately afterwards out of the young and innocent maiden,\nwith equal truth and naturalness: so Shakspeare and Goethe. Poets of the\nsecond rank transform the principal person to be represented into\nthemselves. This is what Byron does; and then the other persons often\nremain lifeless, as is the case even with the principal persons in the\nworks of mediocre poets.\n\nOur pleasure in tragedy belongs, not to the sense of the beautiful, but to\nthat of the sublime; nay, it is the highest grade of this feeling. For, as\nat the sight of the sublime in nature we turn away from the interests of\nthe will, in order to be purely perceptive, so in the tragic catastrophe\nwe turn away even from the will to live. In tragedy the terrible side of\nlife is presented to us, the wail of humanity, the reign of chance and\nerror, the fall of the just, the triumph of the wicked; thus the aspect of\nthe world which directly strives against our will is brought before our\neyes. At this sight we feel ourselves challenged to turn away our will\nfrom life, no longer to will it or love it. But just in this way we become\nconscious that then there still remains something over to us, which we\nabsolutely cannot know positively, but only negatively, as that which does\nnot will life. As the chord of the seventh demands the fundamental chord;\nas the colour red demands green, and even produces it in the eye; so every\ntragedy demands an entirely different kind of existence, another world,\nthe knowledge of which can only be given us indirectly just as here by\nsuch a demand. In the moment of the tragic catastrophe the conviction\nbecomes more distinct to us than ever that life is a bad dream from which\nwe have to awake. So far the effect of the tragedy is analogous to that of\nthe dynamical sublime, for like this it lifts us above the will and its\ninterests, and puts us in such a mood that we find pleasure in the sight\nof what tends directly against it. What gives to all tragedy, in whatever\nform it may appear, the peculiar tendency towards the sublime is the\nawakening of the knowledge that the world, life, can afford us no true\npleasure, and consequently is not worthy of our attachment. In this\nconsists the tragic spirit: it therefore leads to resignation.\n\nI admit that in ancient tragedy this spirit of resignation seldom appears\nand is expressed directly. Œdipus Colonus certainly dies resigned and\nwilling; yet he is comforted by the revenge on his country. Iphigenia at\nAulis is very willing to die; yet it is the thought of the welfare of\nGreece that comforts her, and occasions the change of her mind, on account\nof which she willingly accepts the death which at first she sought to\navoid by any means. Cassandra, in the Agamemnon of the great Æschylus,\ndies willingly, αρκειτω βιος (1306); but she also is comforted by the\nthought of revenge. Hercules, in the Trachiniæ, submits to necessity, and\ndies composed, but not resigned. So also the Hippolytus of Euripides, in\nwhose case it surprises us that Artemis, who appears to comfort him,\npromises him temples and fame, but never points him to an existence beyond\nlife, and leaves him in death, as all gods forsake the dying:—in\nChristianity they come to him; and so also in Brahmanism and Buddhism,\nalthough in the latter the gods are really exotic. Thus Hippolytus, like\nalmost all the tragic heroes of the ancients, shows submission to\ninevitable fate and the inflexible will of the gods, but no surrender of\nthe will to live itself. As the Stoic equanimity is fundamentally\ndistinguished from Christian resignation by the fact that it teaches only\npatient endurance and composed expectation of unalterably necessary evil,\nwhile Christianity teaches renunciation, surrender of the will; so also\nthe tragic heroes of the ancients show resolute subjection under the\nunavoidable blows of fate, while Christian tragedy, on the contrary, shows\nthe surrender of the whole will to live, joyful forsaking of the world in\nthe consciousness of its worthlessness and vanity. But I am also entirely\nof opinion that modern tragedy stands higher than that of the ancients.\nShakspeare is much greater than Sophocles; in comparison with Goethe’s\nIphigenia one might find that of Euripides almost crude and vulgar. The\nBacchæ of Euripides is a revolting composition in favour of the heathen\npriests. Many ancient pieces have no tragic tendency at all, like the\nAlcestis and Iphigenia in Tauris of Euripides; some have disagreeable, or\neven disgusting motives, like the Antigone and Philocteles. Almost all\nshow the human race under the fearful rule of chance and error, but not\nthe resignation which is occasioned by it, and delivers from it. All\nbecause the ancients had not yet attained to the summit and goal of\ntragedy, or indeed of the view of life itself.\n\nAlthough, then, the ancients displayed little of the spirit of\nresignation, the turning away of the will from life, in their tragic\nheroes themselves, as their frame of mind, yet the peculiar tendency and\neffect of tragedy remains the awakening of that spirit in the beholder,\nthe calling up of that frame of mind, even though only temporarily. The\nhorrors upon the stage hold up to him the bitterness and worthlessness of\nlife, thus the vanity of all its struggle. The effect of this impression\nmust be that he becomes conscious, if only in obscure feeling, that it is\nbetter to tear his heart free from life, to turn his will from it, to love\nnot the world nor life; whereby then in his deepest soul, the\nconsciousness is aroused that for another kind of willing there must also\nbe another existence. For if this were not so, then the tendency of\ntragedy would not be this rising above all the ends and good things of\nlife, this turning away from it and its seductions, and the turning\ntowards another kind of existence, which already lies in this, although an\nexistence which is for us quite inconceivable. How would it, then, in\ngeneral, be possible that the exhibition of the most terrible side of\nlife, brought before our eyes in the most glaring light, could act upon us\nbeneficently, and afford us a lofty satisfaction? Fear and sympathy, in\nthe excitement of which Aristotle places the ultimate end of tragedy,\ncertainly do not in themselves belong to the agreeable sensations:\ntherefore they cannot be the end, but only the means. Thus the summons to\nturn away the will from life remains the true tendency of tragedy, the\nultimate end of the intentional exhibition of the suffering of humanity,\nand is so accordingly even where this resigned exaltation of the mind is\nnot shown in the hero himself, but is merely excited in the spectator by\nthe sight of great, unmerited, nay, even merited suffering. Many of the\nmoderns also are, like the ancients, satisfied with throwing the spectator\ninto the mood which has been described, by the objective representation of\nhuman misfortune as a whole; while others exhibit this through the change\nof the frame of mind of the hero himself, effected by suffering. The\nformer give, as it were, only the premisses, and leave the conclusion to\nthe spectator; while the latter give the conclusion, or the moral of the\nfable, also, as the change of the frame of mind of the hero, and even also\nas reflection, in the mouth of the chorus, as, for example, Schiller in\n“The Bride of Messina:” “Life is not the highest good.” Let me remark here\nthat the genuine tragic effect of the catastrophe, thus the resignation\nand exaltation of the mind of the hero which is brought about by it,\nseldom appears so purely motived and so distinctly expressed as in the\nopera of “Norma,” where it comes in in the duet, “_Qual cor tradisti, qual\ncor perdesti_,” in which the change of the will is distinctly indicated by\nthe quietness which is suddenly introduced into the music. In general,\nthis piece—regarded apart altogether from its excellent music, and also\nfrom the diction which can only be that of a libretto, and considered only\naccording to its motives and its inner economy—is a highly perfect\ntragedy, a true pattern of tragic disposition of the motives, tragic\nprogress of the action, and tragic development, together with the effect\nof these upon the frame of mind of the hero, raising it above the world,\nand which is then also communicated to the spectator; indeed the effect\nattained here is the less delusive and the more indicative of the true\nnature of tragedy that no Christians, nor even Christian ideas, appear in\nit.\n\nThe neglect of the unity of time and place with which the moderns are so\noften reproached is only a fault when it goes so far that it destroys the\nunity of the action; for then there only remains the unity of the\nprincipal character, as, for example, in Shakspeare’s “Henry VIII.” But\neven the unity of the action does not need to go so far that the same\nthing is spoken of throughout, as in the French tragedies which in general\nobserve this so strictly that the course of the drama is like a\ngeometrical line without breadth. There it is constantly a case of “Only\nget on! _Pensez à votre affaire!_” and the thing is expedited and hurried\non in a thoroughly business fashion, and no one detains himself with\nirrelevances which do not belong to it, or looks to the right or the left.\nThe Shakspearian tragedy, on the other hand, is like a line which has also\nbreadth: it takes time, _exspatiatur_: speeches and even whole scenes\noccur which do not advance the action, indeed do not properly concern it,\nby which, however, we get to know the characters or their circumstances\nmore fully, and then understand the action also more thoroughly. This\ncertainly remains the principal thing, yet not so exclusively that we\nforget that in the last instance what is aimed at is the representation of\nhuman nature and existence generally.\n\nThe dramatic or epic poet ought to know that he is fate, and should\ntherefore be inexorable, as it is; also that he is the mirror of the human\nrace, and should therefore represent very many bad and sometimes\nprofligate characters, and also many fools, buffoons, and eccentric\npersons; then also, now and again, a reasonable, a prudent, an honest, or\na good man, and only as the rarest exception a truly magnanimous man. In\nthe whole of Homer there is in my opinion no really magnanimous character\npresented, although many good and honest. In the whole of Shakspeare there\nmay be perhaps a couple of noble, though by no means transcendently noble,\ncharacters to be found; perhaps Cordelia, Coriolanus—hardly more; on the\nother hand, his works swarm with the species indicated above. But\nIffland’s and Kotzebue’s pieces have many magnanimous characters; while\nGoldoni has done as I recommended above, whereby he shows that he stands\nhigher. On the other hand, Schiller’s “Minna von Barnhelm” labours under\ntoo much and too universal magnanimity; but so much magnanimity as the one\nMarquis Posa displays is not to be found in the whole of Goethe’s works\ntogether. There is, however, a small German piece called “Duty for Duty’s\nSake” (a title which sounds as if it had been taken from the Critique of\nPractical Reason), which has only three characters, and yet all the three\nare of most transcendent magnanimity.\n\nThe Greeks have taken for their heroes only royal persons; and so also for\nthe most part have the moderns. Certainly not because the rank gives more\nworth to him who is acting or suffering; and since the whole thing is just\nto set human passions in play, the relative value of the objects by which\nthis happens is indifferent, and peasant huts achieve as much as kingdoms.\nMoreover, civic tragedy is by no means to be unconditionally rejected.\nPersons of great power and consideration are yet the best adapted for\ntragedy on this account, that the misfortune in which we ought to\nrecognise the fate of humanity must have a sufficient magnitude to appear\nterrible to the spectator, whoever he may be. Euripides himself says,\n“φευ, φευ, τα μεγαλα, μεγαλα και πασχει κακα” (_Stob. Flor._, vol. ii. p.\n299). Now the circumstances which plunge a citizen family into want and\ndespair are in the eyes of the great or rich, for the most part, very\ninsignificant, and capable of being removed by human assistance, nay,\nsometimes even by a trifle: such spectators, therefore, cannot be\ntragically affected by them. On the other hand, the misfortunes of the\ngreat and powerful are unconditionally terrible, and also accessible to no\nhelp from without; for kings must help themselves by their own power, or\nfall. To this we have to add that the fall is greatest from a height.\nAccordingly persons of the rank of citizens lack height to fall from.\n\nIf now we have found the tendency and ultimate intention of tragedy to be\na turning to resignation, to the denial of the will to live, we shall\neasily recognise in its opposite, comedy, the incitement to the continued\nassertion of the will. It is true the comedy, like every representation of\nhuman life, without exception, must bring before our eyes suffering and\nadversity; but it presents it to us as passing, resolving itself into joy,\nin general mingled with success, victory, and hopes, which in the end\npreponderate; moreover, it brings out the inexhaustible material for\nlaughter of which life, and even its adversities themselves are filled,\nand which under all circumstances ought to keep us in a good humour. Thus\nit declares, in the result, that life as a whole is thoroughly good, and\nespecially is always amusing. Certainly it must hasten to drop the curtain\nat the moment of joy, so that we may not see what comes after; while the\ntragedy, as a rule, so ends that nothing can come after. And moreover, if\nonce we contemplate this burlesque side of life somewhat seriously, as it\nshows itself in the naïve utterances and gestures which trifling\nembarrassment, personal fear, momentary anger, secret envy, and many\nsimilar emotions force upon the forms of the real life that mirrors itself\nhere, forms which deviate considerably from the type of beauty, then from\nthis side also, thus in an unexpected manner, the reflective spectator may\nbecome convinced that the existence and action of such beings cannot\nitself be an end; that, on the contrary, they can only have attained to\nexistence by an error, and that what so exhibits itself is something which\nhad better not be.\n\nChapter XXXVIII.(23) On History.\n\nIn the passage of the first volume referred to below I have fully shown\nthat more is achieved for our knowledge of mankind by poetry than by\nhistory, and why this is so; inasmuch as more real instruction was to be\nexpected from the former than from the latter. Aristotle has also\nconfessed this, for he says: “και φιλοσοφωτερον και σπουδαιοτερον ποιησις\nἱστοριας εστιν” (_et res magis philosophica, et melior poësis est quam\nhistoria_(24)), _De poët._, c. 9. Yet, in order to cause no\nmisunderstanding as to the value of history, I wish here to express my\nthoughts about it.\n\nIn every class and species of things the facts are innumerable, the\nindividuals infinite in number, the variety of their differences\nunapproachable. At the first glance at them the curious mind becomes\ngiddy; however much it investigates, it sees itself condemned to\nignorance. But then comes science: it separates the innumerable multitude,\narranges it under generic conceptions, these again under conceptions of\nspecies, whereby it opens the path to a knowledge of the general and the\nparticular, which also comprehends the innumerable individuals, for it\nholds good of all without one being obliged to consider each particular\nfor itself. Thus it promises satisfaction to the investigating mind. Then\nall sciences place themselves together, and above the real world of\nindividual things, as that which they have divided among them. Over them\nall, however, moves philosophy, as the most general, and therefore\nimportant, rational knowledge, which promises the conclusions for which\nthe others have only prepared the way. History alone cannot properly enter\ninto that series, since it cannot boast of the same advantage as the\nothers, for it lacks the fundamental characteristic of science, the\nsubordination of what is known, instead of which it can only present its\nco‐ordination. Therefore there is no system of history, as there is of\nevery other science. It is therefore certainly rational knowledge, but it\nis not a science. For it never knows the particular by means of the\ngeneral, but must comprehend the particular directly, and so, as it were,\ncreeps along the ground of experience; while the true sciences move above\nit, because they have obtained comprehensive conceptions by means of which\nthey command the particular, and, at least within certain limits,\nanticipate the possibility of things within their sphere, so that they can\nbe at ease even about what may yet have to come. The sciences, since they\nare systems of conceptions, speak always of species; history speaks of\nindividuals. It would accordingly be a science of individuals, which is a\ncontradiction. It also follows that the sciences all speak of that which\nalways is as history, on the other hand, of that which is once, and then\nno more. Since, further, history has to do with the absolutely particular\nand individuals, which from its nature is inexhaustible, it knows\neverything only imperfectly and half. Besides, it must also let itself be\ntaught by every new day in its trivial commonplaceness what as yet it did\nnot know at all. If it should be objected that in history also there is\nsubordination of the particular under the general, because the periods,\nthe governments, and other general changes, or political revolutions, in\nshort, all that is given in historical tables, is the general, to which\nthe special subordinates itself, this would rest upon a false\ncomprehension of the conception of the general. For the general in history\nhere referred to is merely _subjective_, _i.e._, its generality springs\nmerely from the inadequacy of the individual knowledge of the things, but\nnot _objective_, _i.e._, a conception in which the things would actually\nalready be thought together. Even the most general in history is in itself\nonly a particular and individual, a long period of time, or an important\nevent; therefore the special is related to this as the part to the whole,\nbut not as the case to the rule; which, on the contrary, takes place in\nall the sciences proper because they afford conceptions and not mere\nfacts. On this account in these sciences by a correct knowledge of the\ngeneral we can determine with certainty the particular that arises. If,\nfor example, I know the laws of the triangle in general, I can then also\ntell what must be the properties of the triangle laid before me; and what\nholds good of all mammals, for example, that they have double ventricles\nof the heart, exactly seven cervical vertebræ, lungs, diaphragm, bladder,\nfive senses, &c., I can also assert of the strange bat which has just been\ncaught, before dissecting it. But not so in history, where the general is\nno objective general of the conception, but merely a subjective general of\nmy knowledge, which can only be called general inasmuch as it is\nsuperficial. Therefore I may always know in general of the Thirty Years’\nWar that it was a religious war, waged in the seventeenth century; but\nthis general knowledge does not make me capable of telling anything more\ndefinite about its course. The same opposition is also confirmed by the\nfact that in the real sciences the special and individual is that which is\nmost certain, because it rests upon immediate apprehension; the general\ntruths, again, are only abstracted from it; therefore something false may\nbe more easily assumed in the latter. But in history, conversely, the most\ngeneral is the most certain; for example, the periods, the succession of\nthe kings, the revolutions, wars, and treaties of peace; the particulars,\nagain, of the events and their connection is uncertain, and becomes always\nmore so the further one goes into details. Therefore history is the more\ninteresting the more special it is, but the less to be trusted, and\napproaches then in every respect to the romance. For the rest, what\nimportance is to be attached to the boasted pragmatic teaching of history\nhe will best be able to judge who remembers that sometimes it was only\nafter twenty years that he understood the events of his own life in their\ntrue connection, although the data for this were fully before him, so\ndifficult is the combination of the action of the motives under the\nconstant interferences of chance and the concealment of the intentions.\nSince now history really always has for its object only the particular,\nthe individual fact, and regards this as the exclusively real, it is the\ndirect opposite and counterpart of philosophy, which considers things from\nthe most general point of view, and has intentionally the general as its\nobject, which remains identical in every particular; therefore in the\nparticular philosophy sees only the general, and recognises the change in\nits manifestation as unessential: φιλοκαθολου γαρ ὁ φιλοσοφος (_generalium\namator philosophus_). While history teaches us that at every time\nsomething else has been, philosophy tries to assist us to the insight that\nat all times exactly the same was, is, and shall be. In truth, the essence\nof human life, as of nature in general, is given complete in every present\ntime, and therefore only requires depth of comprehension in order to be\nexhaustively known. But history hopes to make up for depth by length and\nbreadth; for it every present time is only a fragment which must be\nsupplemented by the past, the length of which is, however, infinite, and\nto which again an infinite future is joined. Upon this rests the\nopposition between philosophical and historical minds; the former want to\ngo to the bottom, the latter want to go through the whole series. History\nshows on every side only the same under different forms; but whoever does\nnot come to know this in one or a few will hardly attain to a knowledge of\nit by going through all the forms. The chapters of the history of nations\nare at bottom only distinguished by the names and dates; the really\nessential content is everywhere the same.\n\nNow since the material of art is the _Idea_, and the material of science\nthe _concept_, we see both occupied with that which always exists and\nconstantly in the same manner, not something which now is and now is not,\nnow is thus and now otherwise; therefore both have to do with that which\nPlato set up as the exclusive object of real rational knowledge. The\nmaterial of history, on the other hand, is the particular in its\nparticularity and contingency, which at one time is, and then for ever is\nno more, the transient complexities of a human world moved like clouds in\nthe wind, a world which is often entirely transformed by the most trifling\naccident. From this point of view the material of history appears to us as\nscarcely a worthy object of the serious and painful consideration of the\nhuman mind, the human mind which, just because it is so transitory, ought\nto choose for its consideration that which passes not away.\n\nFinally, as regards the endeavour—specially introduced by the Hegelian\npseudo‐philosophy, everywhere so pernicious and stupefying to the mind—to\ncomprehend the history of the world as a planned whole, or, as they call\nit, “to construe it organically,” a crude and positive realism lies at its\nfoundation, which takes the phenomenon for the inner being of the world,\nand imagines that this phenomenon, its forms and events, are the chief\nconcern; in which it is secretly supported by certain mythological notions\nwhich it tacitly assumes: otherwise one might ask for what spectators such\na comedy was really produced. For, since only the individual, and not the\nhuman race, has actual, immediate unity of consciousness, the unity of the\ncourse of life of the race is a mere fiction. Besides, as in nature only\nthe species are real, and the genera are mere abstractions, so in the\nhuman race only the individuals and their course of life are real, the\npeoples and their lives mere abstractions. Finally, constructive\nhistories, guided by a positive optimism, always ultimately end in a\ncomfortable, rich, fat State, with a well‐regulated constitution, good\njustice and police, useful arts and industries, and, at the most, in\nintellectual perfection; for this, in fact, is alone possible, since what\nis moral remains essentially unaltered. But it is the moral element which,\naccording to the testimony of our inmost consciousness, is the whole\nconcern: and this lies only in the individual as the tendency of his will.\nIn truth, only the life of each individual has unity, connection, and true\nsignificance: it is to be regarded as an instruction, and the meaning of\nit is moral. Only the incidents of our _inner_ life, since they concern\nthe will, have true reality, and are actual events; because the will alone\nis the thing in itself. In every microcosm lies the whole macrocosm, and\nthe latter contains nothing more than the former. Multiplicity is\nphenomenal, and external events are mere configurations of the phenomenal\nworld, and have therefore directly neither reality nor significance, but\nonly indirectly through their relation to the wills of the individuals.\nThe endeavour to explain and interpret them directly is accordingly like\nthe endeavour to see in the forms of the clouds groups of men and animals.\nWhat history narrates is in fact only the long, heavy, and confused dream\nof humanity.\n\nThe Hegelians, who regard the philosophy of history as indeed the chief\nend of all philosophy, are to be referred to Plato, who unweariedly\nrepeats that the object of philosophy is that which is unchangeable and\nalways remains, not that which now is thus and now otherwise. All those\nwho set up such constructions of the course of the world, or, as they call\nit, of history, have failed to grasp the principal truth of all\nphilosophy, that what is is at all times the same, all becoming and\narising are only seeming; the Ideas alone are permanent; time ideal. This\nis what Plato holds, this is what Kant holds. One ought therefore to seek\nto understand what exists, what really is, to‐day and always, _i.e._, to\nknow the Ideas (in Plato’s sense). Fools, on the contrary, imagine that\nsomething must first become and happen. Therefore they concede to history\nthe chief place in their philosophy, and construct it according to a\npreconceived plan of the world, according to which everything is ordered\nfor the best, which is then supposed _finaliter_ to appear, and will be a\nglorious thing. Accordingly they take the world as perfectly real, and\nplace the end of it in the poor earthly happiness, which, however much it\nmay be fostered by men and favoured by fate, is a hollow, deceptive,\ndecaying, and sad thing, out of which neither constitutions and legal\nsystems nor steam‐engines and telegraphs can ever make anything that is\nessentially better. The said philosophers and glorifiers of history are\naccordingly simple realists, and also optimists and eudæmonists,\nconsequently dull fellows and incarnate philistines; and besides are\nreally bad Christians, for the true spirit and kernel of Christianity, as\nalso of Brahmanism and Buddhism, is the knowledge of the vanity of earthly\nhappiness, the complete contempt for it, and the turning away from it to\nan existence of another, nay, an opposite, kind. This, I say, is the\nspirit and end of Christianity, the true “humour of the matter;” and not,\nas they imagine, monotheism; therefore even atheistic Buddhism is far more\nclosely related to Christianity than optimistic Judaism or its variety\nIslamism.\n\nA true philosophy of history ought not therefore to consider, as all these\ndo, what (to use Plato’s language) always _becomes_ and never _is_, and\nhold this to be the true nature of things; but it ought to fix its\nattention upon that which always is and never becomes nor passes away.\nThus it does not consist in raising the temporal ends of men to eternal\nand absolute ends, and then with art and imagination constructing their\nprogress through all complications; but in the insight that not only in\nits development, but in its very nature, history is mendacious; for,\nspeaking of mere individuals and particular events, it pretends always to\nrelate something different, while from beginning to end it repeats always\nthe same thing under different names and in a different dress. The true\nphilosophy of history consists in the insight that in all these endless\nchanges and their confusion we have always before us only the same, even,\nunchanging nature, which to‐day acts in the same way as yesterday and\nalways; thus it ought to recognise the identical in all events, of ancient\nas of modern times, of the east as of the west; and, in spite of all\ndifference of the special circumstances, of the costume and the customs,\nto see everywhere the same humanity. This identical element which is\npermanent through all change consists in the fundamental qualities of the\nhuman heart and head—many bad, few good. The motto of history in general\nshould run: _Eadem, sed aliter_. If one has read Herodotus, then in a\nphilosophical regard one has already studied history enough. For\neverything is already there that makes up the subsequent history of the\nworld: the efforts, action, sufferings, and fate of the human race as it\nproceeds from the qualities we have referred to, and the physical earthly\nlot.\n\nIf in what has been said we have recognised that history, regarded as a\nmeans for the knowledge of the nature of man, is inferior to poetry; then,\nthat it is not in the proper sense a science; finally, that the endeavour\nto construct it as a whole with beginning, middle, and end, together with\na significant connection, is vain, and based upon misunderstanding: it\nwould look as if we wished to deny it all value if we did not show in what\nits value consists. Really, however, there remains for it, after this\nconquest by art and rejection by science, a quite special province,\ndifferent from both, in which it exists most honourably.\n\n_What reason is to the individual that is history to the human race._ By\nvirtue of reason, man is not, like the brute, limited to the narrow,\nperceptible present, but also knows the incomparably more extended past,\nwith which it is linked, and out of which it has proceeded; and only thus\nhas he a proper understanding of the present itself, and can even draw\ninferences as to the future. The brute, on the other hand, whose\nknowledge, devoid of reflection, is on this account limited to the\npresent, even when it is tamed, moves about among men ignorant, dull,\nstupid, helpless, and dependent. Analogous to this is the nation that does\nnot know its own history, is limited to the present of the now living\ngeneration, and therefore does not understand itself and its own present,\nbecause it cannot connect it with a past, and explain it from this; still\nless can it anticipate the future. Only through history does a nation\nbecome completely conscious of itself. Accordingly history is to be\nregarded as the rational consciousness of the human race, and is to the\nrace what the reflected and connected consciousness is to the individual\nwho is conditioned by reason, a consciousness through the want of which\nthe brute is confined to the narrow, perceptible present. Therefore every\ngap in history is like a gap in the recollective self‐consciousness of a\nman; and in the presence of a monument of ancient times which has outlived\nthe knowledge of itself, as, for example, the Pyramids, or temples and\npalaces in Yucatan, we stand as senseless and stupid as the brute in the\npresence of the action of man, in which it is implicated in his service;\nor as a man before something written in an old cipher of his own, the key\nto which he has forgotten; nay, like a somnambulist who finds before him\nin the morning what he has done in his sleep. In this sense, then, history\nis to be regarded as the reason, or the reflected consciousness, of the\nhuman race, and takes the place of an immediate self‐consciousness common\nto the whole race, so that only by virtue of it does the human race come\nto be a whole, come to be a humanity. This is the true value of history,\nand accordingly the universal and predominating interest in it depends\nprincipally upon the fact that it is a personal concern of the human race.\nNow, what language is for the reason of individuals, as an indispensable\ncondition of its use, writing is for the reason of the whole race here\npointed out; for only with this does its real existence begin, as that of\nthe individual reason begins first with language. Writing serves to\nrestore unity to the consciousness of the human race, which is constantly\ninterrupted by death, and therefore fragmentary; so that the thought which\nhas arisen in the ancestor is thought out by his remote descendant; it\nfinds a remedy for the breaking up of the human race and its consciousness\ninto an innumerable number of ephemeral individuals, and so bids defiance\nto the ever hurrying time, in whose hand goes forgetfulness. As an attempt\nto accomplish this we must regard not only written, but also _stone_\nmonuments, which in part are older than the former. For who will believe\nthat those who, at incalculable cost, set in action the human powers of\nmany thousands for many years in order to construct the pyramids,\nmonoliths, rock tombs, obelisks, temples, and palaces which have already\nexisted for thousands of years, could have had in view the short span of\ntheir own life, too short to let them see the finishing of the\nconstruction, or even the ostensible end which the ignorance of the many\nrequired them to allege? Clearly their real end was to speak to their\nlatest descendants, to put themselves in connection with these, and so to\nestablish the unity of the consciousness of humanity. The buildings of the\nHindus, the Egyptians, even the Greeks and Romans, were calculated to last\nseveral thousand years, because through higher culture their horizon was a\nwider one; while the buildings of the Middle Ages and of modern times have\nonly been intended, at the most, to last a few centuries; which, however,\nis also due to the fact that men trusted more to writing after its use had\nbecome general, and still more since from its womb was born the art of\nprinting. Yet even in the buildings of more recent times we see the desire\nto speak to posterity; and, therefore, it is shameful if they are\ndestroyed or disfigured in order to serve low utilitarian ends. Written\nmonuments have less to fear from the elements, but more to fear from\nbarbarians, than stone ones; they accomplish far more. The Egyptians\nwished to combine the two, for they covered their stone monuments with\nhieroglyphics, nay, they added paintings in case the hieroglyphics should\nno longer be understood.\n\nChapter XXXIX.(25) On The Metaphysics Of Music.\n\nThe outcome, or result, of my exposition of the peculiar significance of\nthis wonderful art, which is given in the passage of the first volume\nreferred to below, and which will here be present to the mind of the\nreader, was, that there is indeed no resemblance between its productions\nand the world as idea, _i.e._, the world of nature, but yet there must be\na distinct _parallelism_, which was then also proved. I have yet to add\nsome fuller particulars with regard to this parallelism, which are worthy\nof attention.\n\nThe four voices, or parts, of all harmony, the bass, the tenor, the alto,\nand the soprana, or the fundamental note, the third, the fifth, and the\noctave, correspond to the four grades in the series of existences, the\nmineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, the brute kingdom, and man. This\nreceives an additional and striking confirmation in the fundamental rule\nof music, that the bass must be at a much greater distance below the three\nupper parts than they have between themselves; so that it must never\napproach nearer to them than at the most within an octave of them, and\ngenerally remains still further below them. Hence, then, the correct triad\nhas its place in the third octave from the fundamental note. Accordingly\nthe effect of _extended_ harmony, in which the bass is widely separated\nfrom the other parts, is much more powerful and beautiful than that of\n_close_ harmony, in which it is moved up nearer to them, and which is only\nintroduced on account of the limited compass of the instruments. This\nwhole rule, however, is by no means arbitrary, but has its root in the\nnatural source of the tonal system; for the nearest consonant intervals\nthat sound along with the fundamental note by means of its vibrations are\nthe octave and its fifth. Now, in this rule we recognise the analogue of\nthe fundamental characteristic of nature on account of which organised\nbeings are much more nearly related to each other than to the inanimate,\nunorganised mass of the mineral kingdom, between which and them exists the\nmost definite boundary and the widest gulf in the whole of nature. The\nfact that the high voice which sings the melody is yet also an integral\npart of the harmony, and therein accords even with the deepest fundamental\nbass, may be regarded as the analogue of the fact that _the same_ matter\nwhich in a human organism is the supporter of the Idea of man must yet\nalso exhibit and support the Ideas of gravitation and chemical qualities,\nthat is, of the lowest grades of the objectification of will.\n\nThat music acts directly upon the will, _i.e._, the feelings, passions,\nand emotions of the hearer, so that it quickly raises them or changes\nthem, may be explained from the fact that, unlike all the other arts, it\ndoes not express the Ideas, or grades of the objectification of the will,\nbut directly the _will itself_.\n\nAs surely as music, far from being a mere accessory of poetry, is an\nindependent art, nay, the most powerful of all the arts, and therefore\nattains its ends entirely with means of its own, so surely does it not\nstand in need of the words of the song or the action of an opera. Music as\nsuch knows the tones or notes alone, but not the causes which produce\nthese. Accordingly, for it even the human voice is originally and\nessentially nothing else than a modified tone, just like that of an\ninstrument; and, like every other tone, it has the special advantages and\ndisadvantages which are a consequence of the instrument that produces it.\nNow, in this case, that this same instrument, as the organ of speech, also\nserves to communicate conceptions is an accidental circumstance, which\nmusic can certainly also make use of, in order to enter into a connection\nwith poetry; but it must never make this the principal matter, and concern\nitself entirely with the expression of what for the most part, nay (as\nDiderot gives us to understand in _Le Neveu de Rameau_), essentially are\ninsipid verses. The words are and remain for the music a foreign addition,\nof subordinate value, for the effect of the tones is incomparably more\npowerful, more infallible, and quicker than that of the words. Therefore,\nif words become incorporated in music, they must yet assume an entirely\nsubordinate position, and adapt themselves completely to it. But the\nrelation appears reversed in the case of the given poetry, thus the song\nor the libretto of an opera to which music is adapted. For the art of\nmusic at once shows in these its power and higher fitness, disclosing the\nmost profound ultimate and secret significance of the feeling expressed in\nthe words or the action presented in the opera, giving utterance to their\npeculiar and true nature, and teaching us the inmost soul of the actions\nand events whose mere clothing and body is set before us on the stage.\nWith regard to this superiority of the music, and also because it stands\nto the libretto and the action in the relation of the universal to the\nparticular, of the rule to the example, it might perhaps appear more\nfitting that the libretto should be written for the music than that the\nmusic should be composed for the libretto. However, in the customary\nmethod, the words and actions of the libretto lead the composer to the\naffections of the will which lie at their foundation, and call up in him\nthe feelings to be expressed; they act, therefore, as a means of exciting\nhis musical imagination. Moreover, that the addition of poetry to music is\nso welcome to us, and a song with intelligible words gives us such deep\nsatisfaction, depends upon the fact that in this way our most direct and\nmost indirect ways of knowing are called into play at once and in\nconnection. The most direct is that for which music expresses the emotions\nof the will itself, and the most indirect that of conceptions denoted by\nwords. When the language of the feelings is in question the reason does\nnot willingly sit entirely idle. Music is certainly able with the means at\nits own disposal to express every movement of the will, every feeling; but\nby the addition of words we receive besides this the objects of these\nfeelings, the motives which occasion them. The music of an opera, as it is\npresented in the score, has a completely independent, separate, and, as it\nwere, abstract existence for itself, to which the incidents and persons of\nthe piece are foreign, and which follows its own unchanging rules;\ntherefore it can produce its full effect without the libretto. But this\nmusic, since it was composed with reference to the drama, is, as it were,\nthe soul of the latter; for, in its connection with the incidents,\npersons, and words, it becomes the expression of the inner significance of\nall those incidents, and of their ultimate and secret necessity which\ndepends upon this significance. The pleasure of the spectator, unless he\nis a mere gaper, really depends upon an indistinct feeling of this. Yet in\nthe opera music also shows its heterogeneous nature and higher reality by\nits entire indifference to the whole material of the incidents; in\nconsequence of which it everywhere expresses the storm of the passions and\nthe pathos of the feelings in the same way, and its tones accompany the\npiece with the same pomp, whether Agamemnon and Achilles or the\ndissensions of a bourgeois family form its material. For only the\npassions, the movements of the will, exist for it, and, like God, it sees\nonly the hearts. It never assimilates itself to the natural; and\ntherefore, even when it accompanies the most ludicrous and extravagant\nfarces of the comic opera, it still preserves its essential beauty,\npurity, and sublimity; and its fusion with these incidents is unable to\ndraw it down from its height, to which all absurdity is really foreign.\nThus the profound and serious significance of our existence hangs over the\nfarce and the endless miseries of human life, and never leaves it for a\nmoment.\n\nIf we now cast a glance at purely instrumental music, a symphony of\nBeethoven presents to us the greatest confusion, which yet has the most\nperfect order at its foundation, the most vehement conflict, which is\ntransformed the next moment into the most beautiful concord. It is _rerum\nconcordia discors_, a true and perfect picture of the nature of the world\nwhich rolls on in the boundless maze of innumerable forms, and through\nconstant destruction supports itself. But in this symphony all human\npassions and emotions also find utterance; joy, sorrow, love, hatred,\nterror, hope, &c., in innumerable degrees, yet all, as it were, only _in\nabstracto_, and without any particularisation; it is their mere form\nwithout the substance, like a spirit world without matter. Certainly we\nhave a tendency to realise them while we listen, to clothe them in\nimagination with flesh and bones, and to see in them scenes of life and\nnature on every hand. Yet, taken generally, this is not required for their\ncomprehension or enjoyment, but rather imparts to them a foreign and\narbitrary addition: therefore it is better to apprehend them in their\nimmediacy and purity.\n\nSince now, in the foregoing remarks, and also in the text, I have\nconsidered music only from the metaphysical side, that is, with reference\nto the inner significance of its performances, it is right that I should\nnow also subject to a general consideration the means by which, acting\nupon our mind, it brings these about; therefore that I should show the\nconnection of that metaphysical side of music, and the physical side,\nwhich has been fully investigated, and is well known, I start from the\ntheory which is generally known, and has by no means been shaken by recent\nobjections, that all harmony of the notes depends upon the coincidence of\ntheir vibrations, which when two notes sound together occurs perhaps at\nevery second, or at every third, or at every fourth vibration, according\nto which, then, they are the octave, the fifth, or the fourth of each\nother, and so on. So long as the vibrations of two notes have a rational\nrelation to each other, which can be expressed in small numbers, they can\nbe connected together in our apprehension through their constantly\nrecurring coincidence: the notes become blended, and are thereby in\nconsonance. If, on the other hand, that relation is an irrational one, or\none which can only be expressed in larger numbers, then no coincidence of\nthe vibrations which can be apprehended occurs, but _obstrepunt sibi\nperpetuo_, whereby they resist being joined together in our apprehension,\nand accordingly are called a dissonance. Now, according to this theory,\nmusic is a means of making rational and irrational relations of numbers\ncomprehensible, not like arithmetic by the help of the concept, but by\nbringing them to a knowledge which is perfectly directly and\nsimultaneously sensible. Now the connection of the metaphysical\nsignificance of music with this its physical and arithmetical basis\ndepends upon the fact that what resists our _apprehension_, the irrational\nrelation, or the dissonance, becomes the natural type of what resists our\n_will_; and, conversely, the consonance, or the rational relation, which\neasily adapts itself to our apprehension, becomes the type of the\nsatisfaction of the will. And further, since that rational and irrational\nelement in the numerical relations of the vibrations admits of innumerable\ndegrees, shades of difference, sequences, and variations, by means of it\nmusic becomes the material in which all the movements of the human heart,\n_i.e._, of the will, movements whose essential nature is always\nsatisfaction and dissatisfaction, although in innumerable degrees, can be\nfaithfully portrayed and rendered in all their finest shades and\nmodifications, which takes place by means of the invention of the melody.\nThus we see here the movements of the will transferred to the province of\nthe mere idea, which is the exclusive scene of the achievements of the\nfine arts, for they absolutely demand that the _will itself_ shall not\ninterfere, and that we shall conduct ourselves as pure _knowing_ subjects.\nTherefore the affections of the will itself, thus actual pain and actual\npleasure, must not be excited, but only their substitutes, that which is\nagreeable to _the intellect_, as a _picture_ of the satisfaction of the\nwill, and that which is more or less repugnant to it, as a _picture_ of\ngreater or less pain. Only thus does music never cause us actual sorrow,\nbut even in its most melancholy strains is still pleasing, and we gladly\nhear in its language the secret history of our will, and all its emotions\nand strivings, with their manifold protractions, hindrances, and griefs,\neven in the saddest melodies. When, on the other hand, in reality and its\nterrors, it is our _will itself_ that is roused and tormented, we have not\nthen to do with tones and their numerical relations, but are rather now\nourselves the trembling string that is stretched and twanged.\n\nBut, further, because, in consequence of the physical theory which lies at\nits foundation, the musical quality of the notes is in the proportion of\nthe rapidity of their vibrations, but not in their relative strength, the\nmusical ear always follows by preference, in harmony, the highest note,\nnot the loudest. Therefore, even in the case of the most powerful\norchestral accompaniment, the soprano comes out clearly, and thus receives\na natural right to deliver the melody. And this is also supported by its\ngreat flexibility, which depends upon the same rapidity of the vibrations,\nand shows itself in the ornate passages, whereby the soprano becomes the\nsuitable representative of the heightened sensibility, susceptible to the\nslightest impression, and determinable by it, consequently of the most\nhighly developed consciousness standing on the uppermost stage of the\nscale of being. Its opposite, from converse causes, is the bass,\ninflexible, rising and falling only in great intervals, thirds, fourths,\nand fifths, and also at every step guided by rigid rules. It is therefore\nthe natural representative of the inorganic kingdom of nature, which is\ninsensible, insusceptible to fine impressions, and only determinable\naccording to general laws. It must indeed never rise by one tone, for\nexample, from a fourth to a fifth, for this produces in the upper parts\nthe incorrect consecutive fifths and octaves; therefore, originally and in\nits own nature, it can never present the melody. If, however, the melody\nis assigned to it, this happens by means of counterpoint, _i.e._, it is an\n_inverted_ bass—one of the upper parts is lowered and disguised as a bass;\nproperly speaking, it then requires a second fundamental bass as its\naccompaniment. This unnaturalness of a melody lying in the bass is the\nreason why bass airs, with full accompaniment, never afford us pure,\nundisturbed pleasure, like the soprano air, which, in the connection of\nharmony, is alone natural. We may remark in passing that such a melodious\nbass, forcibly obtained by inversion, might, in keeping with our\nmetaphysic of music, be compared to a block of marble to which the human\nform has been imparted: and therefore it is wonderfully suitable to the\nstone guest in “Don Juan.”\n\nBut now we shall try to get somewhat nearer the foundation of the genesis\nof melody, which can be accomplished by analysing it into its constituent\nparts, and in any case will afford us the pleasure which arises from\nbringing to abstract and distinct consciousness what every one knows in\nthe concrete, so that it gains the appearance of novelty.\n\nMelody consists of two elements, the one rhythmical, the other harmonious.\nThe former may also be described as the quantitative, the latter as the\nqualitative element, since the first is concerned with the duration, and\nthe second with the pitch of the notes. In the writing of music the former\ndepends upon the perpendicular, and the latter upon the horizontal lines.\nPurely arithmetical relations, thus relations of time, lie at the\nfoundation of both; in the one case the relative duration of the notes, in\nthe other the relative rapidity of their vibrations. The rhythmical\nelement is the essential; for it can produce a kind of melody of itself\nalone, and without the other, as, for example, on the drum; yet complete\nmelody requires both elements. It consists in an alternating _disunion and\nreconciliation_ of them, as I shall show immediately; but first, since I\nhave already spoken of the harmonious element in what has been said, I\nwish to consider the rhythmical element somewhat more closely.\n\n_Rhythm_ is in time what _symmetry_ is in space, division into equal parts\ncorresponding to each other. First, into larger parts, which again fall\ninto smaller parts, subordinate to the former. In the series of the arts\ngiven by me _architecture_ and _music_ are the two extreme ends. Moreover,\naccording to their inner nature, their power, the extent of their spheres,\nand their significance, they are the most heterogeneous, indeed true\nantipodes. This opposition extends even to the form of their appearance,\nfor architecture is in space alone, without any connection with time; and\nmusic is in time alone, without any connection with space.(26) Now hence\nsprings their one point of analogy, that as in architecture that which\norders and holds together is _symmetry_, in music it is _rhythm_, and thus\nhere also it holds true that extremes meet. As the ultimate constituent\nparts of a building are the exactly similar stones, so the ultimate\nconstituent parts of a musical composition are the exactly similar beats;\nyet by being weak or strong, or in general by the measure, which denotes\nthe species of time, these are divided into equal parts, which may be\ncompared to the dimensions of the stone. The musical period consists of\nseveral bars, and it has also two equal parts, one rising, aspiring,\ngenerally going to the dominant, and one sinking, quieting, returning to\nthe fundamental note. Two or several periods constitute a part, which in\ngeneral is also symmetrically doubled by the sign of repetition; two parts\nmake a small piece of music, or only a movement of a larger piece; and\nthus a concerto or sonata usually consists of three movements, a symphony\nof four, and a mass of five. Thus we see the musical composition bound\ntogether and rounded off as a whole, by symmetrical distribution and\nrepeated division, down to the beats and their fractions, with thorough\nsubordination, superordination, and co‐ordination of its members, just as\na building is connected and rounded off by its symmetry. Only in the\nlatter that is exclusively in space which in the former is exclusively in\ntime. The mere feeling of this analogy has in the last thirty years called\nforth the oft‐repeated, daring witticism, that architecture is frozen\nmusic. The origin of this can be traced to Goethe; for, according to\nEckermann’s “Conversations,” vol. ii. p. 88, he said: “I have found among\nmy papers a page on which I call architecture a rigidified music; and\nreally there is something in it; the mood which is produced by\narchitecture approaches the effect of music.” Probably he let fall this\nwitticism much earlier in conversation, and in that case it is well known\nthat there were never wanting persons to pick up what he so let fall that\nthey might afterwards go about decked with it. For the rest, whatever\nGoethe may have said, the analogy of music and architecture, which is here\nreferred by me to its sole ground, the analogy of rhythm with symmetry,\nextends accordingly only to the outward form, and by no means to the inner\nnature of the two arts, which is entirely different. Indeed it would be\nabsurd to wish to put on the same level in essential respects the most\nlimited and the weakest of all the arts, and the most far‐reaching and\npowerful. As an amplification of the analogy pointed out, we might add\nfurther, that when music, as it were in a fit of desire for independence,\nseizes the opportunity of a pause to free itself from the control of\nrhythm, to launch out into the free imagination of an ornate _cadenza_,\nsuch a piece of music divested of all rhythm is analogous to the ruin\nwhich is divested of symmetry, and which accordingly may be called, in the\nbold language of the witticism, a frozen _cadenza_.\n\nAfter this exposition of _rhythm_, I have now to show how the nature of\nmelody consists in the constantly renewed _disunion and reconciliation_ of\nthe rhythmical, and the harmonious elements of it. Its harmonious element\nhas as its assumption the fundamental note, as the rhythmical element has\nthe species of time, and consists in a wandering from it through all the\nnotes of the scale, until by shorter or longer digressions it reaches a\nharmonious interval, generally the dominant or sub‐dominant, which affords\nit an incomplete satisfaction; and then follows, by a similarly long path,\nits return to the fundamental note, with which complete satisfaction\nappears. But both must so take place that the attainment of the interval\nreferred to and the return to the fundamental note correspond with certain\nfavourite points of the rhythm, otherwise it will not work. Thus, as the\nharmonious succession of sounds requires certain notes, first of all the\ntonic, next to it the dominant, and so on, so rhythm, on its part,\nrequires certain _points of time_, certain numbered bars, and certain\nparts of these bars, which are called strong or good beats, or the\naccented parts of the bar, in opposition to the weak or bad beats, or\nunaccented parts of the bar. Now the disunion of these two fundamental\nelements consists in this, that because the demand of one is satisfied\nthat of the other is not; and their reconciliation consists in this, that\nboth are satisfied at once and together. That wandering of the notes until\nthey find a more or less harmonious interval must so take place that this\ninterval is attained only after a definite number of bars, and also at an\naccented part of the bar, and in this way becomes for it a kind of\nresting‐point; and similarly the return to the keynote must take place\nafter a like number of bars, and also at an accented part of the bar, and\nthus complete satisfaction is then attained. So long as this required\ncoincidence of the satisfaction of both elements is not attained, the\nrhythm, on the one hand, may follow its regular course, and, on the other\nhand, the required notes may occur often enough, but yet they will remain\nentirely without that effect through which melody arises. The following\nvery simple example may serve to illustrate this:—\n\n                          \n\nHere the harmonious sequence of notes finds the keynote just at the end of\nthe first bar; but it does not receive any satisfaction from this, because\nthe rhythm is caught at the least accented part of the bar. Immediately\nafterwards, in the second bar, the rhythm has the accented part of the\nbar, but the sequence of notes has arrived at the seventh. Thus here the\ntwo elements of melody are entirely _disunited_; and we feel disquieted.\nIn the second half of the period everything is reversed, and in the last\nnote they are _reconciled_. This kind of thing can be shown in every\nmelody, although generally in a much more extended form. Now the constant\ndisunion and reconciliation of its two elements which there takes place\nis, when metaphysically considered, the copy of the origination of new\nwishes, and then of their satisfaction. Thus, by flattery, music\npenetrates into our hearts, for it presents the image of the complete\nsatisfaction of its wishes. More closely considered, we see in this\nprocedure of melody a condition which, to a certain extent, is _inward_\n(the harmonious) meet with an _outward_ condition (the rhythmical), as if\nby an _accident_,—which is certainly brought about by the composer, and\nwhich may, so far, be compared to rhyme in poetry. But this is just the\ncopy of the meeting of our wishes with the favourable outward\ncircumstances which are independent of them, and is thus the picture of\nhappiness. The effect of the _suspension_ also deserves to be considered\nhere. It is a dissonance which delays the final consonance, which is\nawaited with certainty; and thus the longing for it is strengthened, and\nits appearance satisfies all the more. Clearly an analogue of the\nheightened satisfaction of the will through delay. The complete cadence\nrequires the preceding chord of the seventh on the dominant; because the\nmost deeply felt satisfaction and the most entire relief can only follow\nthe most earnest longing. Thus, in general, music consists of a constant\nsuccession of more or less disquieting chords, _i.e._, chords which excite\nlonging, and more or less quieting and satisfying chords; just as the life\nof the heart (the will) is a constant succession of greater or less\ndisquietude through desire and aversion, and just as various degrees of\nrelief. Accordingly the harmonious sequence of chords consists of the\ncorrect alternation of dissonance and consonance. A succession of merely\nconsonant chords would be satiating, wearisome, and empty, like the\nlanguor produced by the satisfaction of all wishes. Therefore dissonances\nmust be introduced, although they disquiet us and affect us almost\npainfully, but only in order to be resolved again in consonances with\nproper preparation. Indeed, in the whole of music there are really only\ntwo fundamental chords, the dissonant chord of the seventh and the\nconsonant triad, to which all chords that occur can be referred. This just\ncorresponds to the fact, that for the will there are at bottom only\ndissatisfaction and satisfaction, under however many forms they may\npresent themselves. And as there are two general fundamental moods of the\nmind, serenity, or at least healthiness, and sadness, or even oppression,\nso music has two general keys, the major and the minor, which correspond\nto these, and it must always be in one of the two. But it is, in fact,\nvery wonderful that there is a sign of pain which is neither physically\npainful nor yet conventional, but which nevertheless is suitable and\nunmistakable: the minor. From this we may measure how deeply music is\nfounded in the nature of things and of man. With northern nations, whose\nlife is subject to hard conditions, especially with the Russians, the\nminor prevails, even in the church music. Allegro in the minor is very\ncommon in French music, and is characteristic of it; it is as if one\ndanced while one’s shoe pinched.\n\nI add further a few subsidiary remarks. When the key‐note is changed, and\nwith it the value of all the intervals, in consequence of which the same\nnote figures as the second, the third, the fourth, and so on, the notes of\nthe scale are analogous to actors, who must assume now one _rôle_, now\nanother, while their person remains the same. That the actors are often\nnot precisely suited to these _rôles_ may be compared to the unavoidable\nimpurity of every harmonic system (referred to at the end of § 52 of the\nfirst volume) which the equal temperament has introduced.\n\nPerhaps some may be offended, that, according to this metaphysic of it,\nmusic, which so often exalts our minds, which seems to us to speak of\nother and better worlds than ours, yet really only flatters the will to\nlive, because it exhibits to it its nature, deludes it with the image of\nits success, and at the end expresses its satisfaction and contentment.\nThe following passage from the “_Vedas_” may serve to quiet such doubts:\n“_Etanand sroup, quod forma gaudii est,_ τον _pram Atma ex hoc dicunt,\nquod quocunque loco gaudium est, particula e gaudio ejus est_”\n(_Oupnekhat_, vol. i. p. 405; _et iterum_, vol. ii. p. 215).\n\nSUPPLEMENTS TO THE FOURTH BOOK.\n\n    “_Tous les hommes désirent uniquement de se délivrer de la mort:\n    ils ne savent pas se délivrer de la vie._”\n\n    —_Lao‐tsen‐Tao‐te‐King_, ed. STAN. JULIEN, p. 184.\n\nChapter XL. \n\nThe supplements to this fourth book would be very considerable if it were\nnot that two of its principal subjects which stand specially in need of\nbeing supplemented—the freedom of the will and the foundation of\nethics—have, on the occasion of prize questions being set by two\nScandinavian Academies, been fully worked out by me in the form of a\nmonograph, which was laid before the public in the year 1841 under the\ntitle, “The Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics.” Accordingly I assume an\nacquaintance on the part of my readers with the work which has just been\nmentioned, just as unconditionally as in the supplements to the second\nbook I have assumed it with regard to the work “On the Will in Nature.” In\ngeneral I make the demand that whoever wishes to make himself acquainted\nwith my philosophy shall read every line of me. For I am no voluminous\nwriter, no fabricator of compendiums, no earner of pecuniary rewards, not\none whose writings aim at the approbation of a minister; in a word, not\none whose pen is under the influence of personal ends. I strive after\nnothing but the truth, and write as the ancients wrote, with the sole\nintention of preserving my thoughts, so that they may be for the benefit\nof those who understand how to meditate upon them and prize them.\nTherefore I have written little, but that little with reflection and at\nlong intervals, and accordingly I have also confined within the smallest\npossible limits those repetitions which in philosophical works are\nsometimes unavoidable on account of the connection, and from which no\nsingle philosopher is free; so that by far the most of what I have to say\nis only to be found in one place. On this account, then, whoever wishes to\nlearn from me and understand me must leave nothing unread that I have\nwritten. Yet one can judge me and criticise me without this, as experience\nhas shown; and to this also I further wish much pleasure.\n\nMeanwhile the space gained by the said elimination of two important\nsubjects will be very welcome to us. For since those explanations, which\nevery man has more at heart than anything else, and which therefore in\nevery system, as ultimate results, form the apex of its pyramid, are also\ncrowded together in _my_ last book, a larger space will gladly be granted\nto every firmer proof or more accurate account of these. Besides this we\nhave been able to discuss here, as belonging to the doctrine of the\n“assertion of the will to live,” a question which in our fourth book\nitself remained untouched, as it was also entirely neglected by all\nphilosophers before me: it is the inner significance and real nature of\nthe sexual love, which sometimes rises to a vehement passion—a subject\nwhich it would not have been paradoxical to take up in the ethical part of\nphilosophy if its importance had been known.\n\nChapter XLI.(27) On Death And Its Relation To The Indestructibility Of Our\nTrue Nature.\n\nDeath is the true inspiring genius, or the muse of philosophy, wherefore\nSocrates has defined the latter as θανατου μελετη. Indeed without death\nmen would scarcely philosophise. Therefore it will be quite in order that\na special consideration of this should have its place here at the\nbeginning of the last, most serious, and most important of our books.\n\nThe brute lives without a proper knowledge of death; therefore the\nindividual brute enjoys directly the absolute imperishableness of the\nspecies, for it is only conscious of itself as endless. In the case of men\nthe terrifying certainty of death necessarily entered with reason. But as\neverywhere in nature with every evil a means of cure, or at least some\ncompensation, is given, the same reflection which introduces the knowledge\nof death also assists us to _metaphysical_ points of view, which comfort\nus concerning it, and of which the brute has no need and is incapable. All\nreligious and philosophical systems are principally directed to this end,\nand are thus primarily the antidote to the certainty of death, which the\nreflective reason produces out of its own means. Yet the degree in which\nthey attain this end is very different, and certainly _one_ religion or\nphilosophy will, far more than the others, enable men to look death in the\nface with a quiet glance. Brahmanism and Buddhism, which teach man to\nregard himself as himself, the original being, the Brahm, to which all\ncoming into being and passing away is essentially foreign, will achieve\nmuch more in this respect than such as teach that man is made out of\nnothing, and actually begins at birth his existence derived from another.\nAnswering to this we find in India a confidence and a contempt for death\nof which one has no conception in Europe. It is, in fact, a hazardous\nthing to force upon a man, by early imprinting them, weak and untenable\nconceptions in this important regard, and thereby making him for ever\nincapable of taking up correct and stable ones. For example, to teach him\nthat he recently came out of nothing, and consequently through an eternity\nhas been nothing, but yet for the future will be imperishable, is just the\nsame as to teach him that although he is through and through the work of\nanother, yet he will be held responsible through all eternity for his\nactions. If, then, when the mind ripens and reflection appears, the\nuntenable nature of such doctrines forces itself upon him, he has nothing\nbetter to put in its place, nay, is no longer capable of understanding\nanything better, and thus loses the comfort which nature had destined for\nhim also, as a compensation for the certainty of death. In consequence of\nsuch a process, we see even now in England (1844), among ruined factory\nhands, the Socialists, and in Germany, among ruined students, the young\nHegelians, sink to the absolutely physical point of view, which leads to\nthe result: _edite_, _bibite_, _post mortem nulla voluptas_, and so far\nmay be defined as bestialism.\n\nHowever, after all that has been taught concerning death, it cannot be\ndenied that, at least in Europe, the opinion of men, nay, often even of\nthe same individual, very frequently vacillates between the conception of\ndeath as absolute annihilation and the assumption that we are, as it were,\nwith skin and hair, immortal. Both are equally false: but we have not so\nmuch to find a correct mean as rather to gain the higher point of view\nfrom which such notions disappear of themselves.\n\nIn these considerations I shall first of all start from the purely\nempirical standpoint. Here there primarily lies before us the undeniable\nfact that, according to the natural consciousness, man not only fears\ndeath for his own person more than anything else, but also weeps violently\nover the death of those that belong to him, and indeed clearly not\negotistically, for his own loss, but out of sympathy for the great\nmisfortune that has befallen them. Therefore he also censures those who in\nsuch a case neither weep nor show sadness as hard‐hearted and unloving. It\nis parallel with this that revenge, in its highest degree, seeks the death\nof the adversary as the greatest evil that can be inflicted. Opinions\nchange with time and place; but the voice of nature remains always and\neverywhere the same, and is therefore to be heeded before everything else.\nNow here it seems distinctly to say that death is a great evil. In the\nlanguage of nature death means annihilation. And that death is a serious\nmatter may be concluded from the fact that, as every one knows, life is no\njoke. We must indeed deserve nothing better than these two.\n\nIn fact, the fear of death is independent of all knowledge; for the brute\nhas it, although it does not know death. Everything that is born brings it\nwith it into the world. But this fear of death is _a priori_ only the\nreverse side of the will to live, which indeed we all are. Therefore in\nevery brute the fear of its destruction is inborn, like the care for its\nmaintenance. Thus it is the fear of death, and not the mere avoidance of\npain, which shows itself in the anxious carefulness with which the brute\nseeks to protect itself, and still more its brood, from everything that\nmight become dangerous. Why does the brute flee, trembling, and seek to\nconceal itself? Because it is simply the will to live, but, as such, is\nforfeited to death, and wishes to gain time. Such also, by nature, is man.\nThe greatest evil, the worst that can anywhere threaten, is death; the\ngreatest fear is the fear of death. Nothing excites us so irresistibly to\nthe most lively interest as danger to the life of others; nothing is so\nshocking as an execution. Now the boundless attachment to life which\nappears here cannot have sprung from knowledge and reflection; to these it\nrather appears foolish, for the objective worth of life is very uncertain,\nand at least it remains doubtful whether it is preferable to not being,\nnay, if experience and reflection come to be expressed, not being must\ncertainly win. If one knocked on the graves, and asked the dead whether\nthey wished to rise again, they would shake their heads. Such is the\nopinion of Socrates in “Plato’s Apology,” and even the gay and amiable\nVoltaire cannot help saying, “_On aime la vie; mais le néant ne laisse pas\nd’avoir du bon_;” and again, “_Je ne sais pas ce que c’est que la vie\néternelle, mais celle‐ci est une mauvaise plaisanterie_.” Besides, life\nmust in any case soon end; so that the few years which perhaps one has yet\nto be vanish entirely before the endless time when one will be no more.\nAccordingly it appears to reflection even ludicrous to be so anxious about\nthis span of time, to tremble so much if our own life or that of another\nis in danger, and to compose tragedies the horror of which has its\nstrength in the fear of death. That powerful attachment to life is\ntherefore irrational and blind; it can only be explained from the fact\nthat our whole inner nature is itself will to live, to which, therefore,\nlife must appear as the highest good, however embittered, short, and\nuncertain it may always be; and that that will, in itself and originally,\nis unconscious and blind. Knowledge, on the contrary, far from being the\nsource of that attachment to life, even works against it, for it discloses\nthe worthlessness of life, and thus combats the fear of death. When it\nconquers, and accordingly the man faces death courageously and composedly,\nthis is honoured as great and noble, thus we hail then the triumph of\nknowledge over the blind will to live, which is yet the kernel of our own\nbeing. In the same way we despise him in whom knowledge is defeated in\nthat conflict, and who therefore clings unconditionally to life, struggles\nto the utmost against approaching death, and receives it with despair;(28)\nand yet in him it is only the most original being of ourselves and of\nnature that expresses itself. We may here ask, in passing, how could this\nboundless love of life and endeavour to maintain it in every way as long\nas possible be regarded as base, contemptible, and by the adherents of\nevery religion as unworthy of this, if it were the gift of good gods, to\nbe recognised with thankfulness? And how could it then seem great and\nnoble to esteem it lightly? Meanwhile, what is confirmed by these\nconsiderations is—(1.) that the will to live is the inmost nature of man;\n(2.) that in itself it is unconscious and blind; (3.) that knowledge is an\nadventitious principle, which is originally foreign to the will; (4.) that\nknowledge conflicts with the will, and that our judgment applauds the\nvictory of knowledge over the will.\n\nIf what makes death seem so terrible to us were the thought of not being,\nwe would necessarily think with equal horror of the time when as yet we\nwere not. For it is irrefutably certain that not being after death cannot\nbe different from not being before birth, and consequently is also no more\ndeplorable. A whole eternity has run its course while as yet we were not,\nbut that by no means disturbs us. On the other hand, we find it hard, nay,\nunendurable, that after the momentary intermezzo of an ephemeral\nexistence, a second eternity should follow in which we shall no longer be.\nShould, then, this thirst for existence have arisen because we have now\ntasted it and have found it so delightful? As was already briefly\nexplained above, certainly not; far sooner could the experience gained\nhave awakened an infinite longing for the lost paradise of non‐existence.\nTo the hope, also, of the immortality of the soul there is always added\nthat of a “better world”—a sign that the present world is not much good.\nNotwithstanding all this, the question as to our state after death has\ncertainly been discussed, in books and verbally, ten thousand times\noftener than the question as to our state before birth. Yet theoretically\nthe one is just as near at hand and as fair a problem as the other; and\nbesides, whoever had answered the one would soon see to the bottom of the\nother. We have fine declamations about how shocking it would be to think\nthat the mind of man, which embraces the world, and has so many very\nexcellent thoughts, should sink with him into the grave; but we hear\nnothing about this mind having allowed a whole eternity to pass before it\ncame into being with these its qualities, and how the world must have had\nto do without it all that time. Yet no question presents itself more\nnaturally to knowledge, uncorrupted by the will, than this: An infinite\ntime has passed before my birth; what was I during this time?\nMetaphysically, it might perhaps be answered, “I was always I; that is,\nall who during that time said I, were just I.” But let us look away from\nthis to our present entirely empirical point of view, and assume that I\ndid not exist at all. Then I can console myself as to the infinite time\nafter my death, when I shall not be, with the infinite time when I already\nwas not, as a well‐accustomed, and indeed very comfortable, state. For the\neternity _a parte post_ without me can be just as little fearful as the\neternity _a parte ante_ without me, since the two are distinguished by\nnothing except by the interposition of an ephemeral dream of life. All\nproofs, also, for continued existence after death may just as well be\napplied _in partem ante_, where they then demonstrate existence before\nlife, in the assumption of which the Hindus and Buddhists therefore show\nthemselves very consistent. Kant’s ideality of time alone solves all these\nriddles. But we are not speaking of that now. This, however, results from\nwhat has been said, that to mourn for the time when one will be no more is\njust as absurd as it would be to mourn over the time when as yet one was\nnot; for it is all the same whether the time which our existence does not\nfill is related to that which it does fill, as future or as past.\n\nBut, also, regarded entirely apart from these temporal considerations, it\nis in and for itself absurd to look upon not being as an evil; for every\nevil, as every good, presupposes existence, nay, even consciousness: but\nthe latter ceases with life, as also in sleep and in a swoon; therefore\nthe absence of it is well known to us, and trusted, as containing no evil\nat all: its entrance, however, is always an affair of a moment. From this\npoint of view Epicurus considered death, and therefore quite rightly said,\n“ὁ θανατος μηδεν προς ἡμας” (Death does not concern us); with the\nexplanation that when we are death is not, and when death is we are not\n(_Diog. Laert._, x. 27). To have lost what cannot be missed is clearly no\nevil. Therefore ceasing to be ought to disturb us as little as not having\nbeen. Accordingly from the standpoint of knowledge there appears\nabsolutely no reason to fear death. But consciousness consists in knowing;\ntherefore, for consciousness death is no evil. Moreover, it is really not\nthis _knowing_ part of our _ego_ that fears death, but the _fuga mortis_\nproceeds entirely and alone from the blind _will_, of which everything\nliving is filled. To this, however, as was already mentioned above, it is\nessential, just because it is will to live, whose whole nature consists in\nthe effort after life and existence, and which is not originally endowed\nwith knowledge, but only in consequence of its objectification in animal\nindividuals. If now the will, by means of knowledge, beholds death as the\nend of the phenomenon with which it has identified itself, and to which,\ntherefore, it sees itself limited, its whole nature struggles against it\nwith all its might. Whether now it has really something to fear from death\nwe will investigate further on, and will then remember the real source of\nthe fear of death, which has been shown here along with the requisite\ndistinction of the willing and the knowing part of our nature.\n\nCorresponding to this, then, what makes death so terrible to us is not so\nmuch the end of life—for this can appear to no one specially worthy of\nregret—but rather the destruction of the organism; really because this is\nthe will itself exhibiting itself as body. But we only really feel this\ndestruction in the evils of disease or of old age; death itself, on the\nother hand, consists for the _subject_ only in the moment when\nconsciousness vanishes because the activity of the brain ceases. The\nextension of the stoppage to all the other parts of the organism which\nfollows this is really already an event after death. Thus death, in a\nsubjective regard, concerns the consciousness alone. Now what the\nvanishing of this may be every one can to a certain extent judge of from\ngoing to sleep; but it is still better known to whoever has really\nfainted, for in this the transition is not so gradual, nor accompanied by\ndreams, but first the power of sight leaves us, still fully conscious, and\nthen immediately the most profound unconsciousness enters; the sensation\nthat accompanies it, so far as it goes, is anything but disagreeable; and\nwithout doubt, as sleep is the brother of death, so the swoon is its twin‐\nbrother. Even violent death cannot be painful, for even severe wounds are\nnot felt at all till some time afterwards, often not till the outward\nsigns of them are observed. If they are rapidly mortal, consciousness will\nvanish before this discovery; if they result in death later, then it is\nthe same as with other illnesses. All those also who have lost\nconsciousness in water, or from charcoal fumes, or through hanging are\nwell known to say that it happened without pain. And now, finally, the\ndeath which is properly in accordance with nature, death from old age,\neuthanasia, is a gradual vanishing and sinking out of existence in an\nimperceptible manner. Little by little in old age, the passions and\ndesires, with the susceptibility for their objects, are extinguished; the\nemotions no longer find anything to excite them; for the power of\npresenting ideas to the mind always becomes weaker, its images fainter;\nthe impressions no longer cleave to us, but pass over without leaving a\ntrace, the days roll ever faster, events lose their significance,\neverything grows pale. The old man stricken in years totters about or\nrests in a corner now only a shadow, a ghost of his former self. What\nremains there for death to destroy? One day a sleep is his last, and his\ndreams are ——. They are the dreams which Hamlet inquires after in the\nfamous soliloquy. I believe we dream them even now.\n\nI have here also to remark that the maintenance of the life process,\nalthough it has a metaphysical basis, does not go on without resistance,\nand consequently not without effort. It is this to which the organism\nyields every night, on account of which it then suspends the brain\nfunction and diminishes certain secretions, the respiration, the pulse,\nand the development of heat. From this we may conclude that the entire\nceasing of the life process must be a wonderful relief to its motive\nforce; perhaps this has some share in the expression of sweet contentment\non the faces of most dead persons. In general the moment of death may be\nlike the moment of awaking from a heavy dream that has oppressed us like a\nnightmare.\n\nUp to this point the result we have arrived at is that death, however much\nit may be feared, can yet really be no evil. But often it even appears as\na good thing, as something wished for, as a friend. All that have met with\ninsuperable obstacles to their existence or their efforts, that suffer\nfrom incurable diseases or inconsolable griefs, have as a last refuge,\nwhich generally opens to them of its own accord, the return into the womb\nof nature, from which they arose for a short time, enticed by the hope of\nmore favourable conditions of existence than have fallen to their lot, and\nthe same path out of which constantly remains open. That return is the\n_cessio bonorum_ of life. Yet even here it is only entered upon after a\nphysical and moral conflict: so hard does one struggle against returning\nto the place from which one came out so lightly and readily, to an\nexistence which has so much suffering and so little pleasure to offer. The\nHindus give the god of death, Yama, two faces; one very fearful and\nterrible, and one very cheerful and benevolent. This partly explains\nitself from the reflections we have just made.\n\nAt the empirical point of view at which we still stand, the following\nconsideration is one which presents itself of its own accord, and\ntherefore deserves to be accurately defined by illustration, and thereby\nreferred to its proper limits. The sight of a dead body shows me that\nsensibility, irritability, circulation of the blood, reproduction, &c.,\nhave here ceased. I conclude from this with certainty that what actuated\nthese hitherto, which was yet always something unknown to me, now actuates\nthem no longer, thus has departed from them. But if I should now wish to\nadd that this must have been just what I have known only as consciousness,\nconsequently as intelligence (soul), this would be not only an unjustified\nbut clearly a false conclusion. For consciousness has always showed itself\nto me not as the cause, but as the product and result of the organised\nlife, for it rose and sank in consequence of this in the different periods\nof life, in health and sickness, in sleep, in a swoon, in awaking, &c.,\nthus always appeared as effect, never as cause of the organised life,\nalways showed itself as something which arises and passes away, and again\narises, so long as the conditions of this still exist, but not apart from\nthem. Nay, I may also have seen that the complete derangement of\nconsciousness, madness, far from dragging down with it and depressing the\nother forces, or indeed endangering life, heightens these very much,\nespecially irritability or muscular force, and rather lengthens than\nshortens life, if other causes do not come in. Then, also: I knew\nindividuality as a quality of everything organised, and therefore, if this\nis a self‐conscious organism, also of consciousness. But there exists no\noccasion now to conclude that individuality was inherent in that vanished\nprinciple, which imparts life, and is completely unknown to me; all the\nless so as I see that everywhere in nature each particular phenomenon is\nthe work of a general force which is active in thousands of similar\nphenomena. But, on the other hand, there is just as little occasion to\nconclude that because the organised life has ceased here that force which\nhitherto actuated it has also become nothing; as little as to infer the\ndeath of the spinner from the stopping of the spinning‐wheel. If a\npendulum, by finding its centre of gravity, at last comes to rest, and\nthus its individual apparent life has ceased, no one will imagine that\ngravitation is now annihilated; but every one comprehends that, after as\nbefore, it is active in innumerable phenomena. Certainly it might be urged\nagainst this comparison, that here also, in this pendulum, gravitation has\nnot ceased to be active, but only to manifest its activity palpably;\nwhoever insists on this may think, instead, of an electrical body, in\nwhich, after its discharge, electricity has actually ceased to be active.\nI only wished to show in this that we ourselves recognise in the lowest\nforces of nature an eternity and ubiquity with regard to which the\ntransitory nature of their fleeting phenomena never makes us err for a\nmoment. So much the less, then, should it come into our mind to regard the\nceasing of life as the annihilation of the living principle, and\nconsequently death as the entire destruction of the man. Because the\nstrong arm which, three thousand years ago, bent the bow of Ulysses is no\nmore, no reflective and well‐regulated understanding will regard the force\nwhich acted so energetically in it as entirely annihilated, and therefore,\nupon further reflection, will also not assume that the force which bends\nthe bow to‐day first began with this arm. The thought lies far nearer us,\nthat the force which earlier actuated the life which now has vanished is\nthe same which is active in the life which now flourishes: nay, this is\nalmost inevitable. Certainly, however, we know that, as was explained in\nthe second book, only that is perishable which is involved in the causal\nseries; but only the states and forms are so involved. On the other hand,\nuntouched by the change of these which is introduced by causes, there\nremain on the one side matter, and on the other side natural forces: for\nboth are the presupposition of all these changes. But the principle of our\nlife we must, primarily at least, conceive as a force of nature, until\nperhaps a more profound investigation has brought us to know what it is in\nitself. Thus, taken simply as a force of nature, the vital force remains\nentirely undisturbed by the change of forms and states, which the bond of\ncause and effect introduces and carries off again, and which alone are\nsubject to the process of coming into being and passing away, as it lies\nbefore us in experience. Thus so far the imperishable nature of our true\nbeing can be proved with certainty. But it is true this will not satisfy\nthe claims which are wont to be made upon proofs of our continued\nexistence after death, nor insure the consolation which is expected from\nsuch proofs. However, it is always something; and whoever fears death as\nan absolute annihilation cannot afford to despise the perfect certainty\nthat the inmost principle of his life remains untouched by it. Nay, the\nparadox might be set up, that that second thing also which, just like the\nforces of nature, remains untouched by the continual change under the\nguidance of causality, thus matter, by its absolute permanence, insures us\nindestructibility, by virtue of which whoever was incapable of\ncomprehending any other might yet confidently trust in a certain\nimperishableness. “What!” it will be said, “the permanence of the mere\ndust, of the crude matter, is to be regarded as a continuance of our\nbeing?” Oh! do you know this dust, then? Do you know what it is and what\nit can do? Learn to know it before you despise it. This matter which now\nlies there as dust and ashes will soon, dissolved in water, form itself as\na crystal, will shine as metal, will then emit electric sparks, will by\nmeans of its galvanic intensity manifest a force which, decomposing the\nclosest combinations, reduces earths to metals; nay, it will, of its own\naccord, form itself into plants and animals, and from its mysterious womb\ndevelop that life for the loss of which you, in your narrowness, are so\npainfully anxious. Is it, then, absolutely nothing to continue to exist as\nsuch matter? Nay, I seriously assert that even this permanence of matter\naffords evidence of the indestructibility of our true nature, though only\nas in an image or simile, or, rather, only as in outline. To see this we\nonly need to call to mind the explanation of matter given in chapter 24,\nfrom which it resulted that mere formless matter—this basis of the world\nof experience which is never perceived for itself alone, but assumed as\nconstantly remaining—is the immediate reflection, the visibility in\ngeneral, of the thing in itself, thus of the will. Therefore, whatever\nabsolutely pertains to the will as such holds good also of matter, and it\nreflects the true eternal nature of the will under the image of temporal\nimperishableness. Because, as has been said, nature does not lie, no view\nwhich has sprung from a purely objective comprehension of it, and been\nlogically thought out, can be absolutely false, but at the most only very\none‐sided and imperfect. Such, however, is, indisputably, consistent\nmaterialism; for instance, that of Epicurus, just as well as the absolute\nidealism opposed to it, like that of Berkeley, and in general every\nphilosophical point of view which has proceeded from a correct _apperçu_,\nand been honestly carried out. Only they are all exceedingly one‐sided\ncomprehensions, and therefore, in spite of their opposition, they are all\ntrue, each from a definite point of view; but as soon as one has risen\nabove this point of view, then they only appear as relatively and\nconditionally true. The highest standpoint alone, from which one surveys\nthem all and knows them in their relative truth, but also beyond this, in\ntheir falseness, can be that of absolute truth so far as this is in\ngeneral attainable. Accordingly we see, as was shown above, that in the\nvery crude, and therefore very old, point of view of materialism proper\nthe indestructibility of our true nature in itself is represented, as by a\nmere shadow of it, the imperishableness of matter; as in the already\nhigher naturalism of an absolute physics it is represented by the ubiquity\nand eternity of the natural forces, among which the vital force is at\nleast to be counted. Thus even these crude points of view contain the\nassertion that the living being suffers no absolute annihilation through\ndeath, but continues to exist in and with the whole of nature.\n\nThe considerations which have brought us to this point, and to which the\nfurther explanations link themselves on, started from the remarkable fear\nof death which fills all living beings. But now we will change the\nstandpoint and consider how, in contrast to the individual beings, the\n_whole_ of nature bears itself with reference to death. In doing this,\nhowever, we still always remain upon the ground of experience.\n\nCertainly we know no higher game of chance than that for death and life.\nEvery decision about this we watch with the utmost excitement, interest,\nand fear; for in our eyes all in all is at stake. On the other hand,\nnature, which never lies, but is always straightforward and open, speaks\nquite differently upon this theme, speaks like Krishna in the\nBhagavadgita. What it says is: The death or the life of the individual is\nof no significance. It expresses this by the fact that it exposes the life\nof every brute, and even of man, to the most insignificant accidents\nwithout coming to the rescue. Consider the insect on your path; a slight,\nunconscious turning of your step is decisive as to its life or death. Look\nat the wood‐snail, without any means of flight, of defence, of deception,\nof concealment, a ready prey for all. Look at the fish carelessly playing\nin the still open net; the frog restrained by its laziness from the flight\nwhich might save it; the bird that does not know of the falcon that soars\nabove it; the sheep which the wolf eyes and examines from the thicket. All\nthese, provided with little foresight, go about guilelessly among the\ndangers that threaten their existence every moment. Since now nature\nexposes its organisms, constructed with such inimitable skill, not only to\nthe predatory instincts of the stronger, but also to the blindest chance,\nto the humour of every fool, the mischievousness of every child without\nreserve, it declares that the annihilation of these individuals is\nindifferent to it, does it no harm, has no significance, and that in these\ncases the effect is of no more importance than the cause. It says this\nvery distinctly, and it does not lie; only it makes no comments on its\nutterances, but rather expresses them in the laconic style of an oracle.\nIf now the all‐mother sends forth her children without protection to a\nthousand threatening dangers, this can only be because she knows that if\nthey fall they fall back into her womb, where they are safe; therefore\ntheir fall is a mere jest. Nature does not act otherwise with man than\nwith the brutes. Therefore its declaration extends also to man: the life\nand death of the individual are indifferent to it. Accordingly, in a\ncertain sense, they ought also to be indifferent to us, for we ourselves\nare indeed nature. Certainly, if only we saw deep enough, we would agree\nwith nature, and regard life and death as indifferently as it does.\nMeanwhile, by means of reflection, we must attribute that carelessness and\nindifference of nature towards the life of the individuals to the fact\nthat the destruction of such a phenomenon does not in the least affect its\ntrue and proper nature.\n\nIf we further ponder the fact, that not only, as we have just seen, are\nlife and death dependent upon the most trifling accidents, but that the\nexistence of the organised being in general is an ephemeral one, that\nanimal and plant arise to‐day and pass away to‐morrow, and birth and death\nfollow in quick succession, while to the unorganised things which stand so\nmuch lower an incomparably longer duration is assured, and an infinite\nduration to the absolutely formless matter alone, to which, indeed, we\nattribute this _a priori_,—then, I think, the thought must follow of its\nown accord, even from the purely empirical, but objective and unprejudiced\ncomprehension of such an order of things, that this is only a superficial\nphenomenon, that such a constant arising and passing away can by no means\ntouch the root of things, but can only be relative, nay, only apparent, in\nwhich the true inner nature of that thing is not included, the nature\nwhich everywhere evades our glance and is thoroughly mysterious, but\nrather that this continues to exist undisturbed by it; although we can\nneither apprehend nor conceive the manner in which this happens, and must\ntherefore think of it only generally as a kind of _tour de passe‐passe_\nwhich took place there. For that, while what is most imperfect, the\nlowest, the unorganised, continues to exist unassailed, it is just the\nmost perfect beings, the living creatures, with their infinitely\ncomplicated and inconceivably ingenious organisations, which constantly\narise, new from the very foundation, and after a brief span of time\nabsolutely pass into nothingness, to make room for other new ones like\nthem coming into existence out of nothing—this is something so obviously\nabsurd that it can never be the true order of things, but rather a mere\nveil which conceals this, or, more accurately, a phenomenon conditioned by\nthe nature of our intellect. Nay, the whole being and not being itself of\nthese individuals, in relation to which death and life are opposites, can\nonly be relative. Thus the language of nature, in which it is given us as\nabsolute, cannot be the true and ultimate expression of the nature of\nthings and of the order of the world, but indeed only a _patois du pays_,\n_i.e._, something merely relatively true,—something to be understood _cum\ngrano salis_, or, to speak properly, something conditioned by our\nintellect; I say, an immediate, intuitive conviction of the kind which I\nhave tried to describe in words will press itself upon every one; _i.e._,\ncertainly only upon every one whose mind is not of an utterly ordinary\nspecies, which is absolutely only capable of knowing the particular simply\nand solely as such, which is strictly limited to the knowledge of\nindividuals, after the manner of the intellect of the brutes. Whoever, on\nthe other hand, by means of a capacity of an only somewhat higher power,\neven just begins to see in the individual beings their universal, their\nIdeas, will also, to a certain extent, participate in that conviction, and\nthat indeed as an immediate, and therefore certain, conviction. In fact,\nit is also only small, limited minds that fear death quite seriously as\ntheir annihilation, and persons of decidedly superior capacity are\ncompletely free from such terrors. Plato rightly bases the whole of\nphilosophy upon the knowledge of the doctrine of Ideas, _i.e._, upon the\nperception of the universal in the particular. But the conviction here\ndescribed, which proceeds directly from the comprehension of nature, must\nhave been exceedingly vivid in those sublime authors of the Upanishads of\nthe Vedas, who can scarcely be thought of as mere men, for it speaks to us\nso forcibly out of an innumerable number of their utterances that we must\nascribe this immediate illumination of their mind to the fact that these\nwise men, standing nearer the origin of our race in time, comprehended the\nnature of things more clearly and profoundly than the already deteriorated\nrace, ὁιοι νυν βροτοι εισιν, is able to do. But certainly their\ncomprehension is assisted by the natural world of India, which is endowed\nwith life in a very different degree from our northern world. However,\nthorough reflection, as pursued by Kant’s great mind, leads by another\npath to the same result, for it teaches us that our intellect, in which\nthat phenomenal world which changes so fast exhibits itself, does not\ncomprehend the true ultimate nature of things, but merely its phenomenal\nmanifestation, and indeed, as I add, because it is originally only\ndestined to present the motives to our will, _i.e._, to be serviceable to\nit in the pursuit of its paltry ends.\n\nLet us, however, carry our objective and unprejudiced consideration of\nnature still further. If I kill a living creature, whether a dog, a bird,\na frog, or even only an insect, it is really inconceivable that this\nbeing, or rather the original force by virtue of which such a marvellous\nphenomenon exhibited itself just the moment before, in its full energy and\nlove of life, should have been annihilated by my wicked or thoughtless\nact. And again, on the other hand, the millions of animals of every kind\nwhich come into existence every moment, in infinite variety, full of force\nand activity, can never, before the act of their generation, have been\nnothing at all, and have attained from nothing to an absolute beginning.\nIf now in this way I see one of these withdraw itself from my sight,\nwithout me knowing where it goes, and another appear without me knowing\nwhence it comes; if, moreover, both have the same form, the same nature,\nthe same character, and only not the same matter, which yet during their\nexistence they continually throw off and renew; then certainly the\nassumption, that that which vanishes and that which appears in its place\nare one and the same, which has only experienced a slight alteration, a\nrenewal of the form of its existence, and that consequently death is for\nthe species what sleep is for the individual; this assumption, I say, lies\nso close at hand that it is impossible not to light upon it, unless the\nmind, perverted in early youth by the imprinting of false views, hurries\nit out of the way, even from a distance, with superstitious fear. But the\nopposite assumption that the birth of an animal is an arising out of\nnothing, and accordingly that its death is its absolute annihilation, and\nthis with the further addition that man, who has also originated out of\nnothing, has yet an individual, endless existence, and indeed a conscious\nexistence, while the dog, the ape, the elephant, are annihilated by death,\nis really something against which the healthy mind revolts and which it\nmust regard as absurd. If, as is sufficiently often repeated, the\ncomparison of the results of a system with the utterances of the healthy\nmind is supposed to be a touchstone of its truth, I wish the adherents of\nthe system which was handed down from Descartes to the pre‐Kantian\neclectics, nay, which even now is still the prevailing view of the great\nmajority of cultured people in Europe, would apply this touchstone here.\n\nThroughout and everywhere the true symbol of nature is the circle, because\nit is the schema or type of recurrence. This is, in fact, the most\nuniversal form in nature, which it carries out in everything, from the\ncourse of the stars down to the death and the genesis of organised beings,\nand by which alone, in the ceaseless stream of time, and its content, a\npermanent existence, _i.e._, a nature, becomes possible.\n\nIf in autumn we consider the little world of insects, and see how one\nprepares its bed to sleep the long, rigid winter‐sleep; another spins its\ncocoon to pass the winter as a chrysalis, and awake in spring rejuvenated\nand perfected; and, finally, how most of them, intending themselves to\nrest in the arms of death, merely arrange with care the suitable place for\ntheir egg, in order to issue forth again from it some day renewed;—this is\nnature’s great doctrine of immortality, which seeks to teach us that there\nis no radical difference between sleep and death, but the one endangers\nexistence just as little as the other. The care with which the insect\nprepares a cell, or hole, or nest, deposits its egg in it, together with\nfood for the larva that will come out of it in the following spring, and\nthen quietly dies, is just like the care with which in the evening a man\nlays ready his clothes and his breakfast for the next morning, and then\nquietly goes to sleep; and at bottom it could not take place at all if it\nwere not that the insect which dies in autumn is in itself, and according\nto its true nature, just as much identical with the one which is hatched\nout in the spring as the man who lies down to sleep is identical with the\nman who rises from it.\n\nIf now, after these considerations, we return to ourselves and our own\nspecies, then cast our glance forward far into the future, and seek to\npresent to our minds the future generations, with the millions of their\nindividuals in the strange form of their customs and pursuits, and then\ninterpose with the question: Whence will all these come? Where are they\nnow? Where is the fertile womb of that nothing, pregnant with worlds,\nwhich still conceals the coming races? Would not the smiling and true\nanswer to this be, Where else should they be than there where alone the\nreal always was and will be, in the present and its content?—thus with\nthee, the foolish questioner, who in this mistaking of his own nature is\nlike the leaf upon the tree, which, fading in autumn and about to fall,\ncomplains at its destruction, and will not be consoled by looking forward\nto the fresh green which will clothe the tree in spring, but says\nlamenting, “I am not these! These are quite different leaves!” Oh, foolish\nleaf! Whither wilt thou? And whence should others come? Where is the\nnothing whose abyss thou fearest? Know thine own nature, that which is so\nfilled with thirst for existence; recognise it in the inner, mysterious,\ngerminating force of the tree, which, constantly _one_ and the same in all\ngenerations of leaves, remains untouched by all arising and passing away.\nAnd now, οἱη περ φυλλων γενεη, τοιηδε και ανδρων (_Qualis foliorum\ngeneratio, talis et hominum_). Whether the fly which now buzzes round me\ngoes to sleep in the evening, and buzzes again tomorrow, or dies in the\nevening, and in spring another fly buzzes which has sprung from its egg:\nthat is in itself the same thing; but therefore the knowledge which\nexhibits this as two fundamentally different things is not unconditioned,\nbut relative, a knowledge of the phenomenon, not of the thing in itself.\nIn the morning the fly exists again; it also exists again in the spring.\nWhat distinguishes for it the winter from the night? In Burdach’s\n“Physiology,” vol. i. § 275, we read, “Till ten o’clock in the morning no\n_Cercaria ephemera_ (one of the infusoria) is to be seen (in the\ninfusion), and at twelve the whole water swarms with them. In the evening\nthey die, and the next morning they again appear anew.” So it was observed\nby Nitzsch six days running.\n\nSo everything lingers but a moment, and hastens on to death. The plant and\nthe insect die at the end of the summer, the brute and the man after a few\nyears: death reaps unweariedly. Yet notwithstanding this, nay, as if this\nwere not so at all, everything is always there and in its place, just as\nif everything were imperishable. The plant always thrives and blooms, the\ninsect hums, the brute and the man exist in unwasted youth, and the\ncherries that have already been enjoyed a thousand times we have again\nbefore us every summer. The nations also exist as immortal individuals,\nalthough sometimes their names change; even their action, what they do and\nsuffer, is always the same; although history always pretends to relate\nsomething different: for it is like the kaleidoscope, which at every turn\nshows a new figure, while we really always have the same thing before our\neyes. What then presses itself more irresistibly upon us than the thought\nthat that arising and passing away does not concern the real nature of\nthings, but this remains untouched by it, thus is imperishable, and\ntherefore all and each that _wills_ to exist actually exists continuously\nand without end. Accordingly at every given point of time all species of\nanimals, from the gnat to the elephant, exist together complete. They have\nalready renewed themselves many thousand times, and withal have remained\nthe same. They know nothing of others like them, who have lived before\nthem, or will live after them; it is the species which always lives, and\nin the consciousness of the imperishable nature of the species and their\nidentity with it the individuals cheerfully exist. The will to live\nmanifests itself in an endless present, because this is the form of the\nlife of the species, which, therefore, never grows old, but remains always\nyoung. Death is for it what sleep is for the individual, or what winking\nis for the eye, by the absence of which the Indian gods are known, if they\nappear in human form. As through the entrance of night the world vanishes,\nbut yet does not for a moment cease to exist, so man and brute apparently\npass away through death, and yet their true nature continues, just as\nundisturbed by it. Let us now think of that alternation of death and birth\nas infinitely rapid vibrations, and we have before us the enduring\nobjectification of the will, the permanent Ideas of being, fixed like the\nrainbow on the waterfall. This is temporal immortality. In consequence of\nthis, notwithstanding thousands of years of death and decay, nothing has\nbeen lost, not an atom of the matter, still less anything of the inner\nbeing, that exhibits itself as nature. Therefore every moment we can\ncheerfully cry, “In spite of time, death, and decay, we are still all\ntogether!”\n\nPerhaps we would have to except whoever had once said from the bottom of\nhis heart, with regard to this game, “I want no more.” But this is not yet\nthe place to speak of this.\n\nBut we have certainly to draw attention to the fact that the pain of birth\nand the bitterness of death are the two constant conditions under which\nthe will to live maintains itself in its objectification, _i.e._, our\ninner nature, untouched by the course of time and the death of races,\nexists in an everlasting present, and enjoys the fruit of the assertion of\nthe will to live. This is analogous to the fact that we can only be awake\nduring the day on condition that we sleep during the night; indeed the\nlatter is the commentary which nature offers us for the understanding of\nthat difficult passage.(29)\n\nFor the substratum, or the content, πληρωμα, or the material of the\n_present_, is through all time really the same. The impossibility of\nknowing this identity directly is just _time_, a form and limitation of\nour intellect. That on account of it, for example, the future event is not\nyet, depends upon an illusion of which we become conscious when that event\nhas come. That the essential form of our intellect introduces such an\nillusion explains and justifies itself from the fact that the intellect\nhas come forth from the hands of nature by no means for the apprehension\nof the nature of things, but merely for the apprehension of motives, thus\nfor the service of an individual and temporal phenomenon of will.(30)\n\nWhoever comprehends the reflections which here occupy us will also\nunderstand the true meaning of the paradoxical doctrine of the Eleatics,\nthat there is no arising and passing away, but the whole remains\nimmovable: “Παρμενιδης και Μελισσος ανῃρουν γενεσιν και φθοραν, δια το\nνομιξειν το παν ακινητον” (_Parmenides et Melissus ortum et interitum\ntollebant, quoniam nihil moveri putabant_), _Stob. Ecl._, i. 21. Light is\nalso thrown here upon the beautiful passage of Empedocles which Plutarch\nhas preserved for us in the book, “_Adversus Coloten_,” c. 12:—\n\n    “Νηπιοι; ου γαρ σφιν δολιχοφρονες εισι μεριμναι,\n    Οἱ δη γινεσθαι παρος ουκ εον ελπιζουσι,\n    Η τι καταθνησκειν και εξολλυσθαι ἁπαντη.\n    Ουκ αν ανηρ τοιαυτα σοφος φρεσι μαντευσαιτο,\n    Ὡς οφρα μεν τε βιωσι (το δη βιοτον καλεουσι),\n    Τοφρα μεν ουν εισιν, και σφιν παρα δεινα και ἐσθλα\n    Πριν τε παγεν τε βροτοι, και επει λυθεν, ουδεν αρ᾽ ἐισιν.”\n\n    _(Stulta, et prolixas non admittentia curas_\n    _Pectora: qui sperant, existere posse, quod ante_\n    _Non fuit, aut ullam rem pessum protinus ire_;—\n    _Non animo prudens homo quod præsentiat ullus_,\n    _Dum vivunt (namque hoc vitaï nomine signant)_,\n    _Sunt, et fortuna tum conflictantur utraque_:\n    _Ante ortum nihil est homo, nec post funera quidquam.)_\n\nThe very remarkable and, in its place, astonishing passage in Diderot’s\n“_Jacques le fataliste_,” deserves not less to be mentioned here: “_Un\nchâteau immense, au frontispice duquel on lisait: __‹ __Je n’appartiens à\npersonne, et j’appartiens à tout le monde: vous y étiez avant que d’y\nentrer, vous y serez encore, quand vous en sortirez__ ›_.”\n\nCertainly in the sense in which, when he is begotten, the man arises out\nof nothing, he becomes nothing through death. But really to learn to know\nthis “nothing” would be very interesting; for it only requires moderate\nacuteness to see that this empirical nothing is by no means absolute,\n_i.e._, such as would in every sense be nothing. We are already led to\nthis insight by the observation that all qualities of the parents recur in\nthe children, thus have overcome death. Of this, however, I will speak in\na special chapter.\n\nThere is no greater contrast than that between the ceaseless flight of\ntime, which carries its whole content with it, and the rigid immobility of\nwhat is actually present, which at all times is one and the same. And if\nfrom this point of view we watch in a purely objective manner the\nimmediate events of life, the _Nunc stans_ becomes clear and visible to us\nin the centre of the wheel of time. To the eye of a being of incomparably\nlonger life, which at _one_ glance comprehended the human race in its\nwhole duration, the constant alternation of birth and death would present\nitself as a continuous vibration, and accordingly it would not occur to it\nat all to see in this an ever new arising out of nothing and passing into\nnothing; but just as to our sight the quickly revolving spark appears as a\ncontinuous circle, the rapidly vibrating spring as a permanent triangle,\nthe vibrating cord as a spindle, so to this eye the species would appear\nas that which has being and permanence, death and life as vibrations.\n\nWe will have false conceptions of the indestructibility of our true nature\nby death, so long as we do not make up our minds to study it primarily in\nthe brutes, but claim for ourselves alone a class apart from them, under\nthe boastful name of immortality. But it is this pretension alone, and the\nnarrowness of view from which it proceeds, on account of which most men\nstruggle so obstinately against the recognition of the obvious truth that\nwe are essentially, and in the chief respect, the same as the brutes; nay,\nthat they recoil at every hint of our relationship with these. But it is\nthis denial of the truth which more than anything else closes against them\nthe path to real knowledge of the indestructibility of our nature. For if\nwe seek anything upon a wrong path, we have just on that account forsaken\nthe right path, and upon the path we follow we will never attain to\nanything in the end but late disillusion. Up, then, follow the truth, not\naccording to preconceived notions, but as nature leads! First of all,\nlearn to recognise in the aspect of every young animal the existence of\nthe species that never grows old, which, as a reflection of its eternal\nyouth, imparts to every individual a temporary youth, and lets it come\nforth as new and fresh as if the world were of to‐day. Let one ask himself\nhonestly whether the swallow of this year’s spring is absolutely a\ndifferent one from the swallow of the first spring, and whether really\nbetween the two the miracle of the creation out of nothing has repeated\nitself millions of times, in order to work just as often into the hands of\nabsolute annihilation. I know well that if I seriously assured any one\nthat the cat which now plays in the yard is still the same one which made\nthe same springs and played the same tricks there three hundred years ago,\nhe would think I was mad; but I also know that it is much madder to\nbelieve that the cat of to‐day is through and through and in its whole\nnature quite a different one from the cat of three hundred years ago. One\nonly requires truly and seriously to sink oneself in the contemplation of\none of these higher vertebrates in order to become distinctly conscious\nthat this unfathomable nature, taken as a whole, as it exists there,\ncannot possibly become nothing; and yet, on the other hand, one knows its\ntransitoriness. This depends upon the fact that in this animal the\ninfinite nature of its Idea (species) is imprinted in the finiteness of\nthe individual. For in a certain sense it is of course true that in the\nindividual we always have before us another being—in the sense which\ndepends upon the principle of sufficient reason, in which are also\nincluded time and space, which constitute the _principium\nindividuationis_. But in another sense it is not true—in the sense in\nwhich reality belongs to the permanent forms of things, the Ideas alone,\nand which was so clearly evident to Plato that it became his fundamental\nthought, the centre of his philosophy; and he made the comprehension of it\nthe criterion of capacity for philosophising in general.\n\nAs the scattered drops of the roaring waterfall change with lightning\nrapidity, while the rainbow, whose supporter they are, remains immovably\nat rest, quite untouched by that ceaseless change, so every Idea, _i.e._,\nevery species of living creature remains quite untouched by the continual\nchange of its individuals. But it is the Idea, or the species in which the\nwill to live is really rooted, and manifests itself; and therefore also\nthe will is only truly concerned in the continuance of the species. For\nexample, the lions which are born and die are like the drops of the\nwaterfall; but the _leonitas_, the Idea or form of the lion, is like the\nunshaken rainbow upon it. Therefore Plato attributed true being to the\nIdeas alone, _i.e._, to the species; to the individuals only a ceaseless\narising and passing away. From the profound consciousness of his\nimperishable nature really springs also the confidence and peace of mind\nwith which every brute, and even human individual, moves unconcernedly\nalong amid a host of chances, which may annihilate it any moment, and,\nmoreover, moves straight on to death: out of its eyes, however, there\nshines the peace of the species, which that death does not affect, and\ndoes not concern. Even to man this peace could not be imparted by\nuncertain and changing dogmas. But, as was said, the contemplation of\nevery animal teaches that death is no obstacle to the kernel of life, to\nthe will in its manifestation. What an unfathomable mystery lies, then, in\nevery animal! Look at the nearest one; look at your dog, how cheerfully\nand peacefully he lives! Many thousands of dogs have had to die before it\ncame to this one’s turn to live. But the death of these thousands has not\naffected the Idea of the dog; it has not been in the least disturbed by\nall that dying. Therefore the dog exists as fresh and endowed with\nprimitive force as if this were its first day and none could ever be its\nlast; and out of its eyes there shines the indestructible principle in it,\nthe archæus. What, then, has died during those thousands of years? Not the\ndog—it stands unscathed before us; merely its shadow, its image in our\nform of knowledge, which is bound to time. Yet how can one even believe\nthat that passes away which for ever and ever exists and fills all time?\nCertainly the matter can be explained empirically; in proportion as death\ndestroyed the individuals, generation produced new ones. But this\nempirical explanation is only an apparent explanation: it puts one riddle\nin the place of the other. The metaphysical understanding of the matter,\nalthough not to be got so cheaply, is yet the only true and satisfying\none.\n\nKant, in his subjective procedure, brought to light the truth that time\ncannot belong to the thing in itself, because it lies pre‐formed in our\napprehension. Now death is the temporal end of the temporal phenomenon;\nbut as soon as we abstract time, there is no longer any end, and this word\nhas lost all significance. But I, here upon the objective path, am trying\nto show the positive side of the matter, that the thing in itself remains\nuntouched by time, and by that which is only possible through time,\narising and passing away, and that the phenomena in time could not have\neven that ceaselessly fleeting existence which stands next to nothingness,\nif there were not in them a kernel of the infinite. Eternity is certainly\na conception which has no perception as its foundation; accordingly it has\nalso a merely negative content; it signifies a timeless existence. Time is\nyet merely an image of eternity, ὁ χρονος εἰκων τον αἰωνος, as Plotinus\nhas it; and in the same way our temporal existence is a mere image of our\ntrue nature. This must lie in eternity, just because time is only the form\nof our knowledge; but on account of this alone do we know our own\nexistence, and that of all things as transitory, finite, and subject to\nannihilation.\n\nIn the second book I have shown that the adequate objectivity of the will\nas the thing in itself, at each of its grades, is the (Platonic) Idea;\nsimilarly in the third book that the Ideas of things have the pure subject\nof knowledge as their correlative; consequently the knowledge of them only\nappears exceptionally and temporarily under specially favourable\nconditions. For individual knowledge, on the other hand, thus in time, the\n_Idea_ presents itself under the form of the _species_, which is the Idea\nbroken up through its entrance into time. Therefore the species is the\nmost immediate objectification of the thing in itself, _i.e._, of the will\nto live. The inmost nature of every brute, and also of man, accordingly\nlies in the species; thus the will to live, which is so powerfully active,\nis rooted in this, not really in the individual. On the other hand, in the\nindividual alone lies the immediate consciousness: accordingly it imagines\nitself different from the species, and therefore fears death. The will to\nlive manifests itself in relation to the individual as hunger and the fear\nof death: in relation to the species as sexual instinct and passionate\ncare for the offspring. In agreement with this we find nature, which is\nfree from that delusion of the individual, as careful for the maintenance\nof the species as it is indifferent to the destruction of the individuals:\nthe latter are always only means, the former is the end. Therefore a\nglaring contrast appears between its niggardliness in the endowment of the\nindividuals and its prodigality when the species is concerned. In the\nlatter case from _one_ individual are often annually obtained a hundred\nthousand germs, and more; for example, from trees, fishes, crabs,\ntermites, and many others. In the former case, on the contrary, only\nbarely enough in the way of powers and organs is given to each to enable\nit with ceaseless effort to maintain its life. And, therefore, if an\nanimal is injured or weakened it must, as a rule, starve. And where an\nincidental saving was possible, through the circumstance that one part\ncould upon necessity be dispensed with, it has been withheld, even out of\norder. Hence, for example, many caterpillars are without eyes; the poor\ncreatures grope in the dark from leaf to leaf, which, since they lack\nfeelers, they do by moving three‐fourths of their body back and forward in\nthe air, till they find some object. Hence they often miss their food\nwhich is to be found close by. But this happens in consequence of the _lex\nparsimoniæ naturæ_, to the expression of which _natura nihil facit\nsupervacaneum_ one may add _et nihil largitur_. The same tendency of\nnature shows itself also in the fact that the more fit the individual is,\non account of his age, for the propagation of the species, the more\npowerfully does the _vis naturæ medicatrix_ manifest itself in him, and\ntherefore his wounds heal easily, and he easily recovers from diseases.\nThis diminishes along with the power of generation, and sinks low after it\nis extinct; for now in the eyes of nature the individual has become\nworthless.\n\nIf now we cast another glance at the scale of existences, with the whole\nof their accompanying gradations of consciousness, from the polyp up to\nman, we see this wonderful pyramid, kept in ceaseless oscillation\ncertainly by the constant death of the individuals, yet by means of the\nbond of generation, enduring in the species through the infinite course of\ntime. While, then, as was explained above, the _objective_, the species,\npresents itself as indestructible, the _subjective_, which consists merely\nin the self‐consciousness of these beings, seems to be of the shortest\nduration, and to be unceasingly destroyed, in order, just as often, to\ncome forth again from nothing in an incomprehensible manner. But, indeed,\none must be very short‐sighted to let oneself be deceived by this\nappearance, and not to comprehend that, although the form of temporal\npermanence only belongs to the objective, the subjective, _i.e._, the\nwill, which lives and manifests itself in all, and with it the subject of\nthe _knowledge_ in which all exhibits itself, must be not less\nindestructible; because the permanence of the objective, or external, can\nyet only be the phenomenal appearance of the indestructibility of the\nsubjective or internal; for the former can possess nothing which it has\nnot received on loan from the latter; and cannot be essentially and\noriginally an objective, a phenomenon, and then secondarily and\naccidentally a subjective, a thing in itself, a self‐consciousness. For\nclearly the former as a manifestation presupposes something which\nmanifests itself, as being for other presupposes a being for self, and as\nobject presupposes a subject; and not conversely: because everywhere the\nroot of things must lie in that which they are for themselves, thus in the\nsubjective, not in the objective, _i.e._, in that which they are only for\nothers, in a foreign consciousness. Accordingly we found in the first book\nthat the right starting‐point for philosophy is essentially and\nnecessarily the subjective, _i.e._, the idealistic starting‐point; and\nalso that the opposite starting‐point, that which proceeds from the\nobjective, leads to materialism. At bottom, however, we are far more one\nwith the world than we commonly suppose: its inner nature is our will, its\nphenomenal appearance is our idea. For any one who could bring this unity\nof being to distinct consciousness, the difference between the continuance\nof the external world after his death and his own continuance after death\nwould vanish. The two would present themselves to him as one and the same;\nnay, he would laugh at the delusion that could separate them. For the\nunderstanding of the indestructibility of our nature coincides with that\nof the identity of the macrocosm and the microcosm. Meanwhile one may\nobtain light upon what is said here by a peculiar experiment, performed by\nmeans of the imagination, an experiment which might be called\nmetaphysical. Let any one try to present vividly to his mind the time, in\nany case not far distant, when he will be dead. Then he thinks himself\naway and lets the world go on existing; but soon, to his own astonishment,\nhe will discover that he was nevertheless still there. For he intended to\npresent the world to his mind without himself; but the ego is the\nimmediate element in consciousness, through which alone the world is\nbrought about, and for which alone it exists. This centre of all\nexistence, this kernel of all reality, is to be abolished, and yet the\nworld is to go on existing; it is a thought which can be conceived in the\nabstract, but not realised. The endeavour to accomplish this, the attempt\nto think the secondary without the primary, the conditioned without the\ncondition, that which is supported without the supporter, always fails,\nmuch in the same way as the attempt to think an equilateral, right‐angled\ntriangle, or a destruction or origination of matter, and similar\nimpossibilities. Instead of what was intended, the feeling here presses\nupon us that the world is not less in us than we in it, and that the\nsource of all reality lies within us. The result is really this: the time\nwhen I shall not be will objectively come; but subjectively it can never\ncome. It might therefore, indeed, be asked, how far every one, in his\nheart, actually believes in a thing which he really cannot conceive at\nall; or whether, since the profound consciousness of the\nindestructibleness of our true nature associates itself with that merely\nintellectual experiment, which, however, has already been made more or\nless distinctly by every one, whether, I say, our own death is not perhaps\nfor us at bottom the most incredible thing in the world.\n\nThe deep conviction of the indestructibleness of our nature through death,\nwhich, as is also shown by the inevitable qualms of conscience at its\napproach, every one carries at the bottom of his heart, depends altogether\nupon the consciousness of the original and eternal nature of our being:\ntherefore Spinoza expresses it thus: “_Sentimus, experimurque, nos æternos\nesse_.” For a reasonable man can only think of himself as imperishable,\nbecause he thinks of himself as without beginning, as eternal, in fact as\ntimeless. Whoever, on the other hand, regards himself as having become out\nof nothing must also think that he will again become nothing; for that an\neternity had passed before he was, and then a second eternity had begun,\nthrough which he will never cease to be, is a monstrous thought. Really\nthe most solid ground for our immortality is the old principle: “_Ex\nnihilo nihil fit, et in nihilum nihil potest reverti_.” Theophrastus\nParacelsus very happily says (Works, Strasburg, 1603, vol. ii. p. 6): “The\nsoul in me has arisen out of something; therefore it does not come to\nnothing; for it comes out of something.” He gives the true reason. But\nwhoever regards the birth of the man as his absolute beginning must regard\ndeath as his absolute end. For both are what they are in the same sense;\nconsequently every one can only think of himself as _immortal_ so far as\nhe also thinks of himself as _unborn_, and in the same sense. What birth\nis, that also is death, according to its nature and significance: it is\nthe same line drawn in two directions. If the former is an actual arising\nout of nothing, then the latter is also an actual annihilation. But in\ntruth it is only by means of the _eternity_ of our real being that we can\nconceive it as imperishable, and consequently this imperishableness is not\ntemporal. The assumption that man is made out of nothing leads necessarily\nto the assumption that death is his absolute end. Thus in this the Old\nTestament is perfectly consistent; for no doctrine of immortality is\nsuitable to a creation out of nothing. New Testament Christianity has such\na doctrine because it is Indian in spirit, and therefore more than\nprobably also of Indian origin, although only indirectly, through Egypt.\nBut to the Jewish stem, upon which that Indian wisdom had to be grafted in\nthe Holy Land, such a doctrine is as little suited as the freedom of the\nwill to its determinism, or as\n\n    “_Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam Jungere si velit._”\n\nIt is always bad if one cannot be thoroughly original, and dare not carve\nout of the whole wood. Brahmanism and Buddhism, on the other hand, have\nquite consistently, besides the continued existence after death, an\nexistence before birth to expiate the guilt of which we have this life.\nMoreover, how distinctly conscious they were of the necessary consistency\nin this is shown by the following passage from Colebrooke’s “History of\nthe Indian Philosophy” in the “Transac. of the Asiatic London Society,”\nvol. i. p. 577: “Against the system of the Bhagavatas which is but\npartially heretical, the objection upon which the chief stress is laid by\nVyaso is, that the soul would not be eternal if it were a production, and\nconsequently had a beginning.” Further, in Upham’s “Doctrine of Buddhism,”\np. 110, it is said: “The lot in hell of impious persons called Deitty is\nthe most severe: these are they who, discrediting the evidence of Buddha,\nadhere to the heretical doctrine that all living beings had their\nbeginning in the mother’s womb, and will have their end in death.”\n\nWhoever conceives his existence as merely accidental must certainly fear\nthat he will lose it by death. On the other hand, whoever sees, even only\nin general, that his existence rests upon some kind of original necessity\nwill not believe that this which has produced so wonderful a thing is\nlimited to such a brief span of time, but that it is active in every one.\nBut he will recognise his existence as necessary who reflects that up till\nnow, when he exists, already an infinite time, thus also an infinity of\nchanges, has run its course, but in spite of this he yet exists; thus the\nWhole range of all possible states has already exhausted itself without\nbeing able to destroy his existence. _If he could ever not be, he would\nalready not be now._ For the infinity of the time that has already\nelapsed, with the exhausted possibility of the events in it, guarantees\nthat _what exists, exists necessarily_. Therefore every one must conceive\nhimself as a necessary being, _i.e._, as a being whose existence would\nfollow from its true and exhaustive definition if one only had it. In this\nline of thought, then, really lies the only immanent proof of the\nimperishableness of our nature, _i.e._, the only proof of this that holds\ngood within the sphere of empirical data. In this nature existence must\ninhere, because it shows itself as independent of all states which can\npossibly be introduced through the chain of causes; for these states have\nalready done what they could, and yet our existence has remained unshaken\nby it, as the ray of light by the storm wind which it cuts through. If\ntime, of its own resources, could bring us to a happy state, then we would\nalready have been there long ago; for an infinite time lies behind us. But\nalso: if it could lead us to destruction, we would already have long been\nno more. From the fact that we now exist, it follows, if well considered,\nthat we must at all times exist. For we are ourselves the nature which\ntime has taken up into itself in order to fill its void; consequently it\nfills the whole of time, present, past, and future, in the same way, and\nit is just as impossible for us to fall out of existence as to fall out of\nspace. Carefully considered, it is inconceivable that what once exists in\nall the strength of reality should ever become nothing, and then not be,\nthrough an infinite time. Hence has arisen the Christian doctrine of the\nrestoration of all things, that of the Hindus of the constantly repeated\ncreation of the world by Brahma, together with similar dogmas of the Greek\nphilosophers. The great mystery of our being and not being, to explain\nwhich these and all kindred dogmas have been devised, ultimately rests\nupon the fact that the same thing which objectively constitutes an\ninfinite course of time is subjectively an indivisible, ever present\npresent: but who comprehends it? It has been most distinctly set forth by\nKant in his immortal doctrine of the ideality of time and the sole reality\nof the thing in itself. For it results from this that the really essential\npart of things, of man, of the world, lies permanently and enduringly in\nthe _Nunc stans_, firm and immovable; and that the change of the phenomena\nand events is a mere consequence of our apprehension of them by means of\nour form of perception, which is time. Accordingly, instead of saying to\nmen, “Ye have arisen through birth, but are immortal,” one ought to say to\nthem, “Ye are not nothing,” and teach them to understand this in the sense\nof the saying attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, “Το γαρ ὀν ἀει ἐσται”\n(_Quod enim est, erit semper_), _Stob. Ecl._, i. 43, 6. If, however, this\ndoes not succeed, but the anxious heart raises its old lament, “I see all\nbeings arise through birth out of nothing, and after a brief term again\nreturn to this; my existence also, now in the present, will soon lie in\nthe distant past, and I will be nothing!”—the right answer is, “Dost thou\nnot exist? Hast thou not within thee the valuable present, after which ye\nchildren of time so eagerly strive, now within, actually within? And dost\nthou understand how thou hast attained to it? Knowest thou the paths which\nhave led thee to it, that thou canst know they will be shut against thee\nby death? An existence of thyself after the destruction of thy body is not\nconceivable by thee as possible; but can it be more inconceivable to thee\nthan thy present existence, and how thou hast attained to it? Why shouldst\nthou doubt but that the secret paths to this present, which stood open to\nthee, will also stand open to every future present?”\n\nIf, then, considerations of this kind are at any rate adapted to awaken\nthe conviction that there is something in us which death cannot destroy,\nthis yet only takes place by raising us to a point of view from which\nbirth is not the beginning of our existence. But from this it follows that\nwhat is proved to be indestructible by death is not properly the\nindividual, which, moreover, as having arisen through generation, and\nhaving in itself the qualities of the father and mother, presents itself\nas a mere difference of the species, but as such can only be finite. As,\nin accordance with this, the individual has no recollection of its\nexistence before its birth, so it can have no remembrance of its present\nexistence after death. But every one places his ego in _consciousness_;\nthis seems to him therefore to be bound to individuality, with which,\nbesides, everything disappears which is peculiar to him, as to this, and\ndistinguishes him from others. His continued existence without\nindividuality becomes to him therefore indistinguishable from the\ncontinuance of other beings, and he sees his ego sink. But whoever thus\nlinks his existence to the identity of consciousness, and therefore\ndesires an endless existence after death for this, ought to reflect that\nhe can certainly only attain this at the price of just as endless a past\nbefore birth. For since he has no remembrance of an existence before\nbirth, thus his consciousness begins with birth, he must accept his birth\nas an origination of his existence out of nothing. But then he purchases\nthe endless time of his existence after death for just as long a time\nbefore birth; thus the account balances without any profit for him. If, on\nthe other hand, the existence which death leaves untouched is different\nfrom that of the individual consciousness, then it must be independent of\nbirth, just as of death; and therefore, with regard to it, it must be\nequally true to say, “I will always be,” and “I have always been;” which\nthen gives two infinities for one. But the great equivocation really lies\nin the word “I,” as any one will see at once who remembers the \n\nThe most thorough answer to the question as to the continued existence of\nthe individual after death lies in Kant’s great doctrine of the _ideality\nof time_, which just here shows itself specially fruitful and rich in\nconsequences, for it substitutes a purely theoretical but well‐proved\ninsight for dogmas which upon one path as upon the other lead to the\nabsurd, and thus settles at once the most exciting of all metaphysical\nquestions. Beginning, ending, and continuing are conceptions which derive\ntheir significance simply and solely from time, and are therefore valid\nonly under the presupposition of this. But time has no absolute existence;\nit is not the manner of being of the thing in itself, but merely the form\nof our _knowledge_ of our existence and nature, and that of all things,\nwhich is just on this account very imperfect, and is limited to mere\nphenomena. Thus with reference to this knowledge alone do the conceptions\nof ceasing and continuing find application, not with reference to that\nwhich exhibits itself in these, the inner being of things in relation to\nwhich these conceptions have therefore no longer any meaning. For this\nshows itself also in the fact that an answer to the question which arises\nfrom those time‐conceptions is impossible, and every assertion of such an\nanswer, whether upon one side or the other, is open to convincing\nobjections. One might indeed assert that our true being continues after\ndeath because it is false that it is destroyed; but one might just as well\nassert that it is destroyed because it is false that it continues: at\nbottom the one is as true as the other. Accordingly something like an\nantinomy might certainly be set up here. But it would rest upon mere\nnegations. In it one would deny two contradictorily opposite predicates of\nthe subject of the judgment, but only because the whole category of these\npredicates would be inapplicable to that subject. But if now one denies\nthese two predicates, not together, but separately, it appears as if the\ncontradictory opposite of the predicate which in each case is denied were\nproved of the subject of the judgment. This, however, depends upon the\nfact that here incommensurable quantities are compared, for the problem\nremoves us to a scene where time is abolished, and yet asks about temporal\nproperties which it is consequently equally false to attribute to, or to\ndeny of the subject. This just means: the problem is transcendent. In this\nsense death remains a mystery.\n\nOn the other hand, adhering to that distinction between phenomenon and\nthing in itself, we can make the assertion that, as phenomenon, man is\ncertainly perishable, but yet his true being will not be involved in this.\nThus this true being is indestructible, although, on account of the\nelimination of time‐conceptions which is connected with it, we cannot\nattribute to it continuance. Accordingly we would be led here to the\nconception of an indestructibility which would yet be no continuance. Now\nthis is a conception which, having been obtained on the path of\nabstraction, can certainly also be thought in the abstract, but yet cannot\nbe supported by any perception, and consequently cannot really become\ndistinct; yet, on the other hand, we must here keep in mind that we have\nnot, like Kant, absolutely given up the knowledge of the thing in itself,\nbut know that it is to be sought for in the will. It is true that we have\nnever asserted an absolute and exhaustive knowledge of the thing in\nitself, but rather have seen very well that it is impossible to know\nanything as it is absolutely and in itself. For as soon as I _know_, I\nhave an idea; but this idea, just because it is _my_ idea, cannot be\nidentical with what is known, but repeats it in an entirely different\nform, for it makes a being for other out of a being for self, and is thus\nalways to be regarded as a phenomenal appearance of the thing in itself.\nTherefore for a _knowing_ consciousness, however it may be constituted,\nthere can be always only phenomena. This is not entirely obviated even by\nthe fact that it is my own nature which is known; for, since it falls\nwithin my _knowing_ consciousness, it is already a reflex of my nature,\nsomething different from this itself, thus already in a certain degree\nphenomenon. So far, then, as I am a knowing being, I have even in my own\nnature really only a phenomenon; so far, on the other hand, as I am\ndirectly this nature itself, I am not a _knowing_ being. For it is\nsufficiently proved in the second book that knowledge is only a secondary\nproperty of our being, and introduced by its animal nature. Strictly\nspeaking, then, we know even our own will always merely as phenomenon, and\nnot as it may be absolutely in and for itself. But in that second book,\nand also in my work upon the will in nature, it is fully explained and\nproved that if, in order to penetrate into the inner nature of things,\nleaving what is given merely indirectly and from without, we stick to the\nonly phenomenon into the nature of which an immediate insight from within\nis attainable, we find in this quite definitely, as the ultimate kernel of\nreality, the will, in which therefore we recognise the thing in itself in\nso far as it has here no longer space, although it still has time, for its\nform consequently really only in its most immediate manifestation, and\nwith the reservation that this knowledge of it is still not exhaustive and\nentirely adequate. Thus in this sense we retain here also the conception\nof will as that of the thing in itself.\n\nThe conception of ceasing to be is certainly applicable to man as a\nphenomenon in time, and empirical knowledge plainly presents death as the\nend of this temporal existence. The end of the person is just as real as\nwas its beginning, and in the same sense as before birth we were not,\nafter death we shall be no more. Yet no more can be destroyed by death\nthan was produced by birth; thus not that through which birth first became\npossible. In this sense _natus et denatus_ is a beautiful expression. But\nnow the whole of empirical knowledge affords us merely phenomena;\ntherefore only phenomena are involved in the temporal processes of coming\ninto being and passing away, and not that which manifests itself in the\nphenomena, the thing in itself. For this the opposition of coming into\nbeing and passing away conditioned by the brain, does not exist at all,\nbut has here lost meaning and significance. It thus remains untouched by\nthe temporal end of a temporal phenomenon, and constantly retains that\nexistence to which the conceptions of beginning, end, and continuance are\nnot applicable. But the thing in itself, so far as we can follow it, is in\nevery phenomenal being the will of this being: so also in man.\nConsciousness, on the other hand, consists in knowledge. But knowledge, as\nactivity of the brain, and consequently as function of the organism,\nbelongs, as has been sufficiently proved, to the mere phenomenon, and\ntherefore ends with this. The will alone, whose work, or rather whose\nimage was the body, is that which is indestructible. The sharp distinction\nof will from knowledge, together with the primacy of the former, which\nconstitutes the fundamental characteristic of my philosophy, is therefore\nthe only key to the contradiction which presents itself in so many ways,\nand arises ever anew in every consciousness, even the most crude, that\ndeath is our end, and that yet we must be eternal and indestructible, thus\nthe _sentimus, experimurque nos æternos esse_ of Spinoza. All philosophers\nhave erred in this: they place the metaphysical, the indestructible, the\neternal element in man in the _intellect_. It lies exclusively in the\n_will_, which is entirely different from the intellect, and alone is\noriginal. The intellect, as was most fully shown in the second book, is a\nsecondary phenomenon, and conditioned by the brain, therefore beginning\nand ending with this. The will alone is that which conditions, the kernel\nof the whole phenomenon, consequently free from the forms of the\nphenomenon to which time belongs, thus also indestructible. Accordingly\nwith death consciousness is certainly lost, but not that which produced\nand sustained consciousness; life is extinguished, but not the principle\nof life also, which manifested itself in it. Therefore a sure feeling\ninforms every one that there is something in him which is absolutely\nimperishable and indestructible. Indeed the freshness and vividness of\nmemories of the most distant time, of earliest childhood, bears witness to\nthe fact that something in us does not pass away with time, does not grow\nold, but endures unchanged. But what this imperishable element is one\ncould not make clear to oneself. It is not consciousness any more than it\nis the body upon which clearly consciousness depends. But it is just that\nwhich, when it appears in consciousness, presents itself as _will_. Beyond\nthis immediate manifestation of it we certainly cannot go; because we\ncannot go beyond consciousness; therefore the question what that may be\nwhen it does not come within consciousness, _i.e._, what it is absolutely\nin itself, remains unanswerable.\n\nIn the phenomenon, and by means of its forms, time and space, as\n_principium individuationis_, what presents itself is that the human\nindividual perishes, while the human race, on the contrary, always remains\nand lives. But in the true being of things, which is free from these\nforms, this whole distinction between the individual and the race also\ndisappears, and the two are immediately one. The whole will to live is in\nthe individual, as it is in the race, and therefore the continuance of the\nspecies is merely the image of the indestructibility of the individual.\n\nSince, then, the infinitely important understanding of the\nindestructibility of our true nature by death depends entirely upon the\ndistinction between phenomenon and thing in itself, I wish now to bring\nthis difference into the clearest light by explaining it in the opposite\nof death, thus in the origin of the animal existence, _i.e._, generation.\nFor this process, which is just as mysterious as death, presents to us\nmost directly the fundamental opposition between the phenomenal appearance\nand the true being of things, _i.e._, between the world as idea and the\nworld as will, and also the entire heterogeneity of the laws of these two.\nThe act of procreation presents itself to us in a twofold manner: first,\nfor self‐consciousness, whose only object, as I have often shown, is the\nwill, with all its affections; and then for the consciousness of other\nthings, _i.e._, the world of idea, or the empirical reality of things.\nNow, from the side of the will, thus inwardly, subjectively, for self‐\nconsciousness, that act presents itself as the most immediate and complete\nsatisfaction of the will, _i.e._, as sensual pleasure. From the side of\nthe idea, on the other hand, thus externally, objectively, for the\nconsciousness of other things, this act is just the woof of the most\ncunning of webs, the foundation of the inexpressibly complicated animal\norganism, which then only requires to be developed to become visible to\nour astonished eyes. This organism, whose infinite complication and\nperfection is only known to him who has studied anatomy, cannot, from the\nside of the idea, be otherwise conceived and thought of than as a system\ndevised with the most ingenious forethought and carried out with the most\nconsummate skill and exactness, as the most arduous work of profound\nreflection. But from the side of the will we know, through self‐\nconsciousness, the production of this organism as the work of an act which\nis exactly the opposite of all reflection, an impetuous, blind impulse, an\nexceedingly pleasurable sensation. This opposition is closely related to\nthe infinite contrast, which is shown above, between the absolute facility\nwith which nature produces its works, together with the correspondingly\nboundless carelessness with which it abandons them to destruction, and the\nincalculably ingenious and studied construction of these very works,\njudging from which they must have been infinitely difficult to make, and\ntheir maintenance should have been provided for with all conceivable care;\nwhile we have the opposite before our eyes. If now by this certainly very\nunusual consideration, we have brought together in the boldest manner the\ntwo heterogeneous sides of the world, and, as it were, grasped them with\none hand, we must now hold them fast in order to convince ourselves of the\nentire invalidity of the laws of the phenomenon, or the world as idea, for\nthat of will, or the thing in itself. Then it will become more\ncomprehensible to us that while on the side of the idea, that is, in the\nphenomenal world, there exhibits itself to us now an arising out of\nnothing, and now an entire annihilation of what has arisen, from that\nother side, or in itself, a nature lies before us with reference to which\nthe conceptions of arising and passing away have no significance. For, by\ngoing back to the root, where, by means of self‐consciousness, the\nphenomenon and the thing in itself meet, we have just, as it were,\npalpably apprehended that the two are absolutely incommensurable, and the\nwhole manner of being of the one, together with all the fundamental laws\nof its being, signify nothing, and less than nothing, in the other. I\nbelieve that this last consideration will only be rightly understood by a\nfew, and that it will be displeasing and even offensive to all who do not\nunderstand it, but I shall never on this account omit anything that can\nserve to illustrate my fundamental thought.\n\nAt the beginning of this chapter I have explained that the great clinging\nto life, or rather fear of death, by no means springs from knowledge, in\nwhich case it would be the result of the known value of life; but that\nthat fear of death has its root directly in the _will_, out of the\noriginal nature of which it proceeds, in which it is entirely without\nknowledge, and therefore blind will to live. As we are allured into life\nby the wholly illusory inclination to sensual pleasure, so we are retained\nin it by the fear of death, which is certainly just as illusory. Both\nspring directly from the will, which in itself is unconscious. If, on the\ncontrary, man were merely a _knowing_ being, then death would necessarily\nbe to him not only indifferent, but even welcome. The reflection to which\nwe have here attained now teaches that what is affected by death is merely\nthe _knowing_ consciousness, and the will, on the other hand, because it\nis the thing in itself, which lies at the foundation of every phenomenon,\nis free from all that depends upon temporal determinations, thus is also\nimperishable. Its striving towards existence and manifestation, from which\nthe world results, is constantly satisfied, for this accompanies it as the\nshadow accompanies the body, for it is merely the visibility of its\nnature. That yet in us it fears death results from the fact that here\nknowledge presents its existence to it as merely in the individual\nphenomenon, whence the illusion arises that it will perish with this, as\nmy image in a mirror seems to be destroyed along with it if the mirror is\nbroken; this then, as contrary to its original nature, which is a blind\nstriving towards existence, fills it with horror. From this now it follows\nthat that in us which alone is capable of fearing death, and also alone\nfears it, the _will_, is not affected by it; and that, on the other hand,\nwhat is affected by it and really perishes is that which from its nature\nis capable of no fear, and in general of no desire or emotion, and is\ntherefore indifferent to being and not being, the mere subject of\nknowledge, the intellect, whose existence consists in its relation to the\nworld of idea, _i.e._, the objective world, whose correlative it is, and\nwith whose existence its own is ultimately one. Thus, although the\nindividual consciousness does not survive death, yet that survives it\nwhich alone struggles against it—the will. This also explains the\ncontradiction that from the standpoint of knowledge philosophers have\nalways proved with cogent reasons that death is no evil; yet the fear of\ndeath remains inevitable for all, because it is rooted, not in knowledge,\nbut in the will. It is also a result of the fact that only the will, and\nnot the intellect, is indestructible, that all religions and philosophies\npromise a reward in eternity only to the virtues of the will, or heart,\nnot to those of the intellect, or head.\n\nThe following may also serve to illustrate this consideration. The will,\nwhich constitutes our true being, is of a simple nature; it merely wills,\nand does not know. The subject of knowledge, on the other hand, is a\nsecondary phenomenon, arising from the objectification of the will; it is\nthe point of unity of the sensibility of the nervous system, as it were\nthe focus in which the rays of the activity of all the parts of the brain\nunite. With this, then, it must perish. In self‐consciousness, as that\nwhich alone knows, it stands over against the will as its spectator, and,\nalthough sprung from it, knows it as something different from itself,\nsomething foreign to it, and consequently also only empirically, in time,\nby degrees, in its successive excitements and acts, and also learns its\ndecisions only _a posteriori_, and often very indirectly. This explains\nthe fact that our own nature is a riddle to us, _i.e._, to our intellect,\nand that the individual regards itself as having newly arisen and as\nperishable; although its true nature is independent of time, thus is\neternal. As now the _will_ does not _know_, so conversely the intellect,\nor the subject of knowledge, is simply and solely _knowing_, without ever\n_willing_. This can be proved even physically in the fact that, as was\nalready mentioned in the second book, according to Bichat, the various\nemotions directly affect all parts of the organism and disturb their\nfunctions, with the exception of the brain, which can only be affected by\nthem very indirectly, _i.e._, just in consequence of those disturbances\n(_De la vie et de la mort_, art. 6, § 2). But from this it follows that\nthe subject of knowledge, for itself and as such, cannot take part or\ninterest in anything, but for it the being or not being of everything,\nnay, even of its own self, is a matter of indifference. Now why should\nthis purely neutral being be immortal? It ends with the temporal\nmanifestation of the will, _i.e._, the individual, as it arose with it. It\nis the lantern which is extinguished when it has served its end. The\nintellect, like the perceptible world which exists only in it, is a mere\nphenomenon; but the finiteness of both does not affect that of which they\nare the phenomenal appearance. The intellect is the function of the\ncerebral nervous system; but the latter, like the rest of the body, is the\nobjectivity of the _will_. Therefore the intellect depends upon the\nsomatic life of the organism; but this itself depends upon the will. The\norganised body may thus, in a certain sense, be regarded as the link\nbetween the will and the intellect; although really it is only the will\nitself exhibiting itself spatially in the perception of the intellect.\nDeath and birth are the constant renewal of the consciousness of the will,\nin itself without end and without beginning, which alone is, as it were,\nthe substance of existence (but each such renewal brings a new possibility\nof the denial of the will to live). Consciousness is the life of the\nsubject of knowledge, or the brain, and death is its end. And therefore,\nfinally, consciousness is always new, in each case beginning at the\nbeginning. The will alone is permanent; and, moreover, it is it alone that\npermanence concerns; for it is the will to live. The knowing subject for\nitself is not concerned about anything. In the ego, however, the two are\nbound up together. In every animal existence the will has achieved an\nintellect which is the light by which it here pursues its ends. It may be\nremarked by the way that the fear of death may also partly depend upon the\nfact that the individual will is so loath to separate from the intellect\nwhich has fallen to its lot through the course of nature, its guide and\nguard, without which it knows that it is helpless and blind.\n\nFinally, this explanation also agrees with the commonplace moral\nexperience which teaches us that the will alone is real, while its\nobjects, on the other hand, as conditioned by knowledge, are only\nphenomena, are only froth and vapour, like the wine which Mephistopheles\nprovided in Auerbach’s cellar: after every sensuous pleasure we also say,\n“And yet it seemed as I were drinking wine.”\n\nThe terrors of death depend for the most part upon the false illusion that\nnow the ego vanishes and the world remains. But rather is the opposite the\ncase; the world vanishes, but the inmost kernel of the ego, the supporter\nand producer of that subject, in whose idea alone the world has its\nexistence, remains. With the brain the intellect perishes, and with the\nintellect the objective world, its mere idea. That in other brains,\nafterwards as before, a similar world lives and moves is, with reference\nto the intellect which perishes, a matter of indifference. If, therefore,\nreality proper did not lie in the _will_, and if the moral existence were\nnot that which extends beyond death, then, since the intellect, and with\nit its world, is extinguished, the true nature of things in general would\nbe no more than an endless succession of short and troubled dreams,\nwithout connection among themselves; for the permanence of unconscious\nnature consists merely in the idea of time of conscious nature. Thus a\nworld‐spirit dreaming without end or aim, dreams which for the most part\nare very troubled and heavy, would then be all in all.\n\nWhen, now, an individual experiences the fear of death, we have really\nbefore us the extraordinary, nay, absurd, spectacle of the lord of the\nworlds, who fills all with his being, and through whom alone everything\nthat is has its existence, desponding and afraid of perishing, of sinking\ninto the abyss of eternal nothingness;—while, in truth, all is full of\nhim, and there is no place where he is not, no being in which he does not\nlive; for it is not existence that supports him, but he that supports\nexistence. Yet it is he who desponds in the individual who suffers from\nthe fear of death, for he is exposed to the illusion produced by the\n_principium individuationis_ that his existence is limited to the nature\nwhich is now dying. This illusion belongs to the heavy dream into which,\nas the will to live, he has fallen. But one might say to the dying\nindividual: “Thou ceasest to be something which thou hadst done better\nnever to become.”\n\nSo long as no denial of the will takes place, what death leaves untouched\nis the germ and kernel of quite another existence, in which a new\nindividual finds itself again, so fresh and original that it broods over\nitself in astonishment. What sleep is for the individual, death is for the\nwill as thing in itself. It would not endure to continue the same actions\nand sufferings throughout an eternity without true gain, if memory and\nindividuality remained to it. It flings them off, and this is lethe; and\nthrough this sleep of death it reappears refreshed and fitted out with\nanother intellect, as a new being—“a new day tempts to new shores.”\n\nAs the self‐asserting will to live man has the root of his existence in\nthe species. Accordingly death is the loss of one individuality and the\nassumption of another, consequently a change of individuality under the\nexclusive guidance of one’s own will. For in this alone lies the eternal\npower which could produce its existence with its ego, yet, on account of\nits nature, was not able to maintain it in existence. For death is the\n_démenti_ which the essence (_essentia_) of every one receives in its\nclaim to existence (_existentia_), the appearance of a contradiction which\nlies in every individual existence:\n\n          “For all that arises\n    Is worthy of being destroyed.”\n\nBut an infinite number of such existences, each with its ego, stands\nwithin reach of this power, thus of the will, which, however, will again\nprove just as transitory and perishable. Since now every ego has its\nseparate consciousness, that infinite number of them is, with reference to\nsuch an ego, not different from a single one. From this point of view it\nappears to me not accidental that _ævum_, αἰων, signifies both the\nindividual term of life and infinite time. Indeed from this point of view\nit may be seen, although indistinctly, that ultimately and in themselves\nboth are the same; and according to this there would really be no\ndifference whether I existed only through my term of life or for an\ninfinite time.\n\nCertainly, however, we cannot obtain an idea of all that is said above\nentirely without time‐concepts; yet when we are dealing with the thing in\nitself these ought to be excluded. But it belongs to the unalterable\nlimitations of our intellect that it can never entirely cast off this\nfirst and most immediate form of all its ideas, in order to operate\nwithout it. Therefore we certainly come here upon a kind of\nmetempsychosis, although with the important difference that it does not\nconcern the whole ψυχη, not the _knowing_ being, but the _will_ alone; and\nthus, with the consciousness that the form of time only enters here as an\nunavoidable concession to the limitation of our intellect, so many\nabsurdities which accompany the doctrine of metempsychosis disappear. If,\nindeed, we now call in the assistance of the fact, to be explained in\nchapter 43, that the character, _i.e._, the will, is inherited from the\nfather, and the intellect, on the other hand, from the mother, it agrees\nvery well with our view that the will of a man, in itself individual,\nseparated itself in death from the intellect received from the mother in\ngeneration, and in accordance with its now modified nature, under the\nguidance of the absolutely necessary course of the world harmonising with\nthis, received through a new generation a new intellect, with which it\nbecame a new being, which had no recollection of an earlier existence; for\nthe intellect, which alone has the faculty of memory, is the mortal part\nor the form, while the will is the eternal part, the substance. In\naccordance with this, this doctrine is more correctly denoted by the word\npalingenesis than by metempsychosis. These constant new births, then,\nconstitute the succession of the life‐dreams of a will which in itself is\nindestructible, until, instructed and improved by so much and such various\nsuccessive knowledge in a constantly new form, it abolishes or abrogates\nitself.\n\nThe true and, so to speak, esoteric doctrine of Buddhism, as we have come\nto know it through the latest investigations, also agrees with this view,\nfor it teaches not metempsychosis, but a peculiar palingenesis, resting\nupon a moral basis which it works out and explains with great profundity.\nThis may be seen from the exposition of the subject, well worth reading\nand pondering, which is given in Spence Hardy’s “Manual of Buddhism,” pp.\n394‐96 (with which compare pp. 429, 440, and 445 of the same book), the\nconfirmation of which is to be found in Taylor’s “_Prabodh Chandro Daya_,”\nLondon, 1812, p. 35; also in Sangermano’s “Burmese Empire,” p. 6, and in\nthe “Asiatic Researches,” vol. vi. p. 179, and vol. ix. p. 256. The very\nuseful German compendium of Buddhism by Köppen is also right upon this\npoint. Yet for the great mass of Buddhists this doctrine is too subtle;\ntherefore to them simple metempsychosis is preached as a comprehensible\nsubstitute.\n\nBesides, it must not be neglected that even empirical grounds support a\npalingenesis of this kind. As a matter of fact there does exist a\nconnection between the birth of the newly appearing beings and the death\nof those that are worn out. It shows itself in the great fruitfulness of\nthe human race which appears as a consequence of devastating diseases.\nWhen in the fourteenth century the black death had for the most part\ndepopulated the old world, a quite abnormal fruitfulness appeared among\nthe human race, and twin‐births were very frequent. The circumstance was\nalso very remarkable that none of the children born at this time obtained\ntheir full number of teeth; thus nature, exerting itself to the utmost,\nwas niggardly in details. This is related by F. Schnurrer, “_Chronik der\nSeuchen_,” 1825. Casper also, “_Ueber die wahrscheinliche Lebensdauer des\nMenschen_,” 1835, confirms the principle that the number of births in a\ngiven population has the most decided influence upon the length of life\nand mortality in it, as this always keeps pace with the mortality: so that\nalways and everywhere the deaths and the births increase and decrease in\nlike proportion; which he places beyond doubt by an accumulation of\nevidence collected from many lands and their various provinces. And yet it\nis impossible that there can be a _physical_ causal connection between my\nearly death and the fruitfulness of a marriage with which I have nothing\nto do, or conversely. Thus here the metaphysical appears undeniably and in\na stupendous manner as the immediate ground of explanation of the\nphysical. Every new‐born being indeed comes fresh and blithe into the new\nexistence, and enjoys it as a free gift: but there is, and can be, nothing\nfreely given. Its fresh existence is paid for by the old age and death of\na worn‐out existence which has perished, but which contained the\nindestructible seed out of which this new existence has arisen: they are\n_one_ being. To show the bridge between the two would certainly be the\nsolution of a great riddle.\n\nThe great truth which is expressed here has never been entirely\nunacknowledged, although it could not be reduced to its exact and correct\nmeaning, which is only possible through the doctrine of the primacy and\nmetaphysical nature of the will and the secondary, merely organic nature\nof the intellect. We find the doctrine of metempsychosis, springing from\nthe earliest and noblest ages of the human race, always spread abroad in\nthe earth as the belief of the great majority of mankind, nay, really as\nthe teaching of all religions, with the exception of that of the Jews and\nthe two which have proceeded from it: in the most subtle form, however,\nand coming nearest to the truth, as has already been mentioned, in\nBuddhism. Accordingly, while Christians console themselves with the\nthought of meeting again in another world, in which one regains one’s\ncomplete personality and knows oneself at once, in those other religions\nthe meeting again is already going on now, only incognito. In the\nsuccession of births, and by virtue of metempsychosis or palingenesis, the\npersons who now stand in close connection or contact with us will also be\nborn along with us at the next birth, and will have the same or analogous\nrelations and sentiments towards us as now, whether these are of a\nfriendly or a hostile description. (_Cf._, for example, Spence Hardy’s\n“Manual of Buddhism,” p. 162.) Recognition is certainly here limited to an\nobscure intimation, a reminiscence which cannot be brought to distinct\nconsciousness, and refers to an infinitely distant time;—with the\nexception, however, of Buddha himself, who has the prerogative of\ndistinctly knowing his own earlier births and those of others;—as this is\ndescribed in the “Jâtaka.” But, in fact, if at favourable moment one\ncontemplates, in a purely objective manner, the action of men in reality;\nthe intuitive conviction is forced upon one that it not only is and\nremains constantly the same, according to the (Platonic) Idea, but also\nthat the present generation, in its true inner nature, is precisely and\nsubstantially identical with every generation that has been before it. The\nquestion simply is in what this true being consists. The answer which my\ndoctrine gives to this question is well known. The intuitive conviction\nreferred to may be conceived as arising from the fact that the\nmultiplying‐glasses, time and space, lose for a moment their effect. With\nreference to the universality of the belief in metempsychosis, Obry says\nrightly, in his excellent book, “_Du Nirvana Indien_,” p. 13: “_Cette\nvieille croyance a fait le tour du monde, et était tellement répandue dans\nla haute antiquité, qu’un docte Anglican l’avait jugée sans père, sans\nmère, et sans généalogie_” (_Ths. Burnet, dans Beausobre, Hist. du\nManichéisme_, ii. p. 391). Taught already in the \"Vedas,\" as in all the\nsacred books of India, metempsychosis is well known to be the kernel of\nBrahmanism and Buddhism. It accordingly prevails at the present day in the\nwhole of non‐Mohammedan Asia, thus among more than half of the whole human\nrace, as the firmest conviction, and with an incredibly strong practical\ninfluence. It was also the belief of the Egyptians (Herod., ii. 123), from\nwhom it was received with enthusiasm by Orpheus. Pythagoras, and Plato:\nthe Pythagoreans, however, specially retained it. That it was also taught\nin the mysteries of the Greeks undeniably follows from the ninth book of\nPlato’s “Laws” (pp. 38 and 42, ed. Bip.) Nemesius indeed (_De nat. hom._,\nc. 2) says: “Κοινη μεν οὐν παντες Ἑλληνες, οἱ την ψυχην αθανατον\nαποφηναμενοι, την μετενσωματωσιν δογματιζουσι.” (_Communiter igitur omnes\nGræci, qui animam immortalem statuerunt, eam de uno corpore in aliud\ntransferri censuerunt._) The “Edda” also, especially in the “Völuspá,”\nteaches metempsychosis. Not less was it the foundation of the religion of\nthe Druids (_Cæs. de bello Gall._, vi.; _A. Pictet, Le mystère des Bardes\nde l’ile de Bretagne_, 1856). Even a Mohammedan sect in Hindostan, the\nBohrahs, of which Colebrooke gives a full account in the “Asiatic\nResearches,” vol. vii. p. 336 _sqq._, believes in metempsychosis, and\naccordingly refrains from all animal food. Also among American Indians and\nnegro tribes, nay, even among the natives of Australia, traces of this\nbelief are found, as appears from a minute description given in the\n_Times_ of 29th January 1841 of the execution of two Australian savages\nfor arson and murder. It is said there: “The younger of the two prisoners\nmet his end with a dogged and a determined spirit, as it appeared, of\nrevenge; the only intelligible expressions made use of conveyed an\nimpression that he would rise up a ‘white fellow,’ which it was considered\nstrengthened his resolution.” Also in a book by Ungewitter, “_Der\nWelttheil Australien_,” it is related that the Papuas in Australia\nregarded the whites as their own relations who had returned to the world.\nAccording to all this, the belief in metempsychosis presents itself as the\nnatural conviction of man, whenever he reflects at all in an unprejudiced\nmanner. It would really be that which Kant falsely asserts of his three\npretended Ideas of the reason, a philosopheme natural to human reason,\nwhich proceeds from its forms; and when it is not found it must have been\ndisplaced by positive religious doctrines coming from a different source.\nI have also remarked that it is at once obvious to every one who hears of\nit for the first time. Let any one only observe how earnestly Lessing\ndefends it in the last seven paragraphs of his “_Erziehung des\nMenschengeschlechts_.” Lichtenberg also says in his\n“_Selbstcharacteristik_:” “I cannot get rid of the thought that I died\nbefore I was born.” Even the excessively empirical Hume says in his\nsceptical essay on immortality, p. 23: “The metempsychosis is therefore\nthe only system of this kind that philosophy can hearken to.”(31) What\nresists this belief, which is spread over the whole human race and\ncommends itself alike to the wise and to the vulgar, is Judaism, together\nwith the two religions which have sprung from it, because they teach the\ncreation of man out of nothing, and he has then the hard task of linking\non to this the belief in an endless existence _a parte post_. They\ncertainly have succeeded, with fire and sword, in driving out of Europe\nand part of Asia that consoling primitive belief of mankind; it is still\ndoubtful for how long. Yet how difficult this was is shown by the oldest\nChurch histories. Most of the heretics were attached to this primitive\nbelief; for example, Simonists, Basilidians, Valentinians, Marcionists,\nGnostics, and Manichæans. The Jews themselves have in part fallen into it,\nas Tertullian and Justinus (in his dialogues) inform us. In the Talmud it\nis related that Abel’s soul passed into the body of Seth, and then into\nthat of Moses. Even the passage of the Bible, Matt. xvi. 13‐15, only\nobtains a rational meaning if we understand it as spoken under the\nassumption of the dogma of metempsychosis. Luke, it is true, who also has\nthe passage (ix. 18‐20), adds the words ὁτι προφητης τις των αρχαιων\nανεστῃ, and thus attributes to the Jews the assumption that such an\nancient prophet can rise again body and all, which, since they know that\nhe has already lain between six and seven hundred years in his grave, and\nconsequently has long since turned to dust, would be a palpable absurdity.\nIn Christianity, however, the doctrine of original sin, _i.e._, the\ndoctrine of punishment for the sins of another individual, has taken the\nplace of the transmigration of souls and the expiation in this way of all\nthe sins committed in an earlier life. Both identify, and that with a\nmoral tendency, the existing man with one who has existed before; the\ntransmigration of souls does so directly, original sin indirectly.\n\nDeath is the great reprimand which the will to live, or more especially\nthe egoism, which is essential to this, receives through the course of\nnature; and it may be conceived as a punishment for our existence.(32) It\nis the painful loosing of the knot which the act of generation had tied\nwith sensual pleasure, the violent destruction coming from without of the\nfundamental error of our nature: the great disillusion. We are at bottom\nsomething that ought not to be: therefore we cease to be. Egoism consists\nreally in the fact that man limits all reality to his own person, in that\nhe imagines that he lives in this alone and not in others. Death teaches\nhim better, for it destroys this person, so that the true nature of man,\nwhich is his will, will henceforth live only in other individuals; while\nhis intellect, which itself belonged only to the phenomenon, _i.e._, to\nthe world as idea, and was merely the form of the external world, also\ncontinues to exist in the condition of being idea, _i.e._, in the\n_objective_ being of things as such, thus also only in the existence of\nwhat was hitherto the external world. His whole ego thus lives from this\ntime forth only in that which he had hitherto regarded as non‐ego: for the\ndifference between external and internal ceases. We call to mind here that\nthe better man is he who makes the least difference between himself and\nothers, does not regard them as absolute non‐ego, while for the bad man\nthis difference is great, nay, absolute. I have worked this out in my\nprize essay on the foundation of morals. According to what was said above,\nthe degree in which death can be regarded as the annihilation of the man\nis in proportion to this difference. But if we start from the fact that\nthe distinction of outside me and in me, as a spatial distinction, is only\nfounded in the phenomenon, not in the thing in itself, thus is no\nabsolutely real distinction, then we shall see in the losing of our own\nindividuality only the loss of a phenomenon, thus only an apparent loss.\nHowever much reality that distinction has in the empirical consciousness,\nyet from the metaphysical standpoint the propositions, “I perish, but the\nworld endures,” and “The world perishes but I endure,” are at bottom not\nreally different.\n\nBut, besides all this, death is the great opportunity no longer to be\nI;—to him who uses it. During life the will of man is without freedom: his\naction takes place with necessity upon the basis of his unalterable\ncharacter in the chain of motives. But every one remembers much that he\nhas done, and on account of which he is by no means satisfied with\nhimself. If now he were to go on living, he would go on acting in the same\nway, on account of the unalterable nature of his character. Accordingly he\nmust cease to be what he is in order to be able to arise out of the germ\nof his nature as a new and different being. Therefore death looses these\nbonds; the will again becomes free; for freedom lies in the _Esse_, not in\nthe _Operari_. “_Finditur nodus cordis, dissolvuntur omnes dubitationes,\nejusque opera evanescunt_,” is a very celebrated saying of the Vedas,\nwhich all Vedantic writers frequently repeat.(33) Death is the moment of\nthat deliverance from the one‐sidedness of an individuality which does not\nconstitute the inmost kernel of our being, but is rather to be thought of\nas a kind of aberration of it. The true original freedom re‐enters at this\nmoment, which, in the sense indicated, may be regarded as a _restitutio in\nintegrum_. The peace and quietness upon the countenance of most dead\npersons seems to have its origin in this. Quiet and easy is, as a rule,\nthe death of every good man: but to die willingly, to die gladly, to die\njoyfully, is the prerogative of the resigned, of him who surrenders and\ndenies the will to live. For only he wills to die _really_, and not merely\n_apparently_, and consequently he needs and desires no continuance of his\nperson. The existence which we know he willingly gives up: what he gets\ninstead of it is in our eyes _nothing_, because our existence is, with\nreference to that, _nothing_. The Buddhist faith calls it Nirvana,(34)\n_i.e._, extinction.\n\nChapter XLII. The Life Of The Species.\n\nIn the preceding chapter it was called to mind that the (Platonic) Ideas\nof the different grades of beings, which are the adequate objectification\nof the will to live, exhibit themselves in the knowledge of the\nindividual, which is bound to the form of time, as the _species_, _i.e._,\nas the successive individuals of one kind connected by the bond of\ngeneration, and that therefore the species is the Idea (εἰδος, _species_)\nbroken up in time. Accordingly the true nature of every living thing lies\nprimarily in its species: yet the species again has its existence only in\nthe individuals. Now, although the will only attains to self‐consciousness\nin the individual, thus knows itself immediately only as the individual,\nyet the deep‐seated consciousness that it is really the species in which\nhis true nature objectifies itself appears in the fact that for the\nindividual the concerns of the species as such, thus the relations of the\nsexes, the production and nourishment of the offspring, are of\nincomparably greater importance and consequence than everything else.\nHence, then, arises in the case of the brutes, heat or rut (an excellent\ndescription of the vehemence of which will be found in Burdach’s\n“Physiology,” vol. i. §§ 247, 257), and, in the case of man, the careful\nand capricious selection of the other individual for the satisfaction of\nthe sexual impulse, which can rise to the height of passionate love, to\nthe fuller investigation of which I shall devote a special chapter: hence\nalso, finally the excessive love of parents for their offspring.\n\nIn the supplements to the second book the will was compared to the root\nand the intellect to the crown of the tree; and this is the case inwardly\nor psychologically. But outwardly or physiologically the genitals are the\nroot and the head the crown. The nourishing part is certainly not the\ngenitals, but the villi of the intestines: yet not the latter but the\nformer are the root; because through them the individual is connected with\nthe species in which it is rooted. For physically the individual is a\nproduction of the species, metaphysically a more or less perfect picture\nof the Idea, which, in the form of time, exhibits itself as species. In\nagreement with the relation expressed here, the greatest vitality, and\nalso the decrepitude of the brain and the genital organs, is simultaneous\nand stands in connection. The sexual impulse is to be regarded as the\ninner life of the tree (the species) upon which the life of the individual\ngrows, like a leaf that is nourished by the tree, and assists in\nnourishing the tree; this is why that impulse is so strong, and springs\nfrom the depths of our nature. To castrate an individual means to cut him\noff from the tree of the species upon which he grows, and thus severed,\nleave him to wither: hence the degradation of his mental and physical\npowers. That the service of the species, _i.e._, fecundation, is followed\nin the case of every animal individual by momentary exhaustion and\ndebility of all the powers, and in the case of most insects indeed by\nspeedy death, on account of which Celsus said, “_Seminis emissio est\npartis animæ jactura_;” that in the case of man the extinction of the\ngenerative power shows that the individual approaches death; that\nexcessive use of this power at every age shortens life, while, on the\nother hand, temperance in this respect increases all the powers, and\nespecially the muscular powers, on which account it was part of the\ntraining of the Greek athletes; that the same restraint lengthens the life\nof the insect even to the following spring; all this points to the fact\nthat the life of the individual is at bottom only borrowed from the\nspecies, and that all vital force is, as it were, force of the species\nrestricted by being dammed up. But this is to be explained from the fact\nthat the metaphysical substratum of life reveals itself directly in the\nspecies and only by means of this in the individual. Accordingly the\nLingam with the Yoni, as the symbol of the species and its immortality, is\nworshipped in India, and, as the counterpoise of death, is ascribed as an\nattribute to the very divinity who presides over death, Siva.\n\nBut without myth or symbol, the vehemence of the sexual impulse, the keen\nintentness and profound seriousness with which every animal, including\nman, pursues its concerns, shows that it is through the function which\nserves it that the animal belongs to that in which really and principally\nits true being lies, the _species_; while all other functions and organs\ndirectly serve only the individual, whose existence is at bottom merely\nsecondary. In the vehemence of that impulse, which is the concentration of\nthe whole animal nature, the consciousness further expresses itself that\nthe individual does not endure, and therefore all must be staked on the\nmaintenance of the species, in which its true existence lies.\n\nTo illustrate what has been said, let us now imagine a brute in rut, and\nin the act of generation. We see a seriousness and intentness never known\nin it at any other time. Now what goes on in it? Does it know that it must\ndie, and that through its present occupation a new individual, which yet\nentirely resembles itself, will arise in order to take its place? Of all\nthis it knows nothing, for it does not think. But it is as intently\ncareful for the continuance of the species in time as if it knew all that.\nFor it is conscious that it desires to live and exist, and it expresses\nthe highest degree of this volition in the act of generation; this is all\nthat then takes place in its consciousness. This is also quite sufficient\nfor the permanence of the kind; just because the will is the radical and\nknowledge the adventitious. On this account the will does not require to\nbe guided by knowledge throughout; but whenever in its primitive\noriginality it has resolved, this volition will objectify itself of its\nown accord in the world of the idea. If now in this way it is that\ndefinite animal form which we have thought of that wills life and\nexistence, it does not will life and existence in general, but in this\nparticular form. Therefore it is the sight of its form in the female of\nits species that stimulates the will of the brute to the act of\ngeneration. This volition of the brute, when regarded from without and\nunder the form of time, presents itself as such an animal form maintained\nthrough an infinite time by the constantly repeated replacement of one\nindividual by another, thus by the alternation of death and reproduction,\nwhich so regarded appear only as the pulse‐beats of that form (ιδεα,\nεἰδος, _species_) which endures through all time. They may be compared to\nthe forces of attraction and repulsion in which matter consists. That\nwhich is shown here in the brute holds good also of man; for although in\nhim the act of generation is accompanied by complete knowledge of its\nfinal cause, yet it is not guided by this knowledge, but proceeds directly\nfrom the will to live as its concentration. It is accordingly to be\nreckoned among instinctive actions. For in reproduction the brute is just\nas little guided by knowledge of the end as in mechanical instincts; in\nthese also the will manifests itself, in the main, without the mediation\nof knowledge, which here, as there, is only concerned with details.\nReproduction is, to a certain extent, the most marvellous of all\ninstincts, and its work the most astonishing.\n\nThese considerations explain why the sexual desire has a very different\ncharacter from every other; it is not only the strongest, but even\nspecifically of a more powerful kind than any other. It is everywhere\ntacitly assumed as necessary and inevitable, and is not, like other\ndesires, a matter of taste and disposition. For it is the desire which\neven constitutes the nature of man. In conflict with it no motive is so\nstrong that it would be certain of victory. It is so pre‐eminently the\nchief concern that no other pleasures make up for the deprivation of its\nsatisfaction; and, moreover, for its sake both brute and man undertake\nevery danger and every conflict. A very naïve expression of this\ndisposition is the well‐known inscription on the door of the _fornix_ at\nPompeii, decorated with the phallus: “_Heic habitat felicitas_:” this was\nfor those going in naïve, for those coming out ironical, and in itself\nhumorous. On the other hand, the excessive power of the sexual passion is\nseriously and worthily expressed in the inscription which (according to\nTheon of Smyrna, _De Musica_, c. 47), Osiris had placed upon the column he\nerected to the eternal gods: “To Eros, the spirit, the heaven, the sun,\nthe moon, the earth, the night, the day, and the father of all that is and\nthat shall be;” also in the beautiful apostrophe with which Lucretius\nbegins his work:\n\n    “_Æneadum genetrix, hominum divomque voluptas,_\n    _Alma Venus cet._”\n\nTo all this corresponds the important _rôle_ which the relation of the\nsexes plays in the world of men, where it is really the invisible central\npoint of all action and conduct, and peeps out everywhere in spite of all\nveils thrown over it. It is the cause of war and the end of peace, the\nbasis of what is serious, and the aim of the jest, the inexhaustible\nsource of wit, the key to all allusions, and the meaning of all mysterious\nhints, of all unspoken offers and all stolen glances, the daily meditation\nof the young, and often also of the old, the hourly thought of the\nunchaste, and even against their will the constantly recurring imagination\nof the chaste, the ever ready material of a joke, just because the\nprofoundest seriousness lies at its foundation. It is, however, the\npiquant element and the joke of life that the chief concern of all men is\nsecretly pursued and ostensibly ignored as much as possible. But, in fact,\nwe see it every moment seat itself, as the true and hereditary lord of the\nworld, out of the fulness of its own strength, upon the ancestral throne,\nand looking down from thence with scornful glances, laugh at the\npreparations which have been made to bind it, imprison it, or at least to\nlimit it and wherever it is possible to keep it concealed, or even so to\nmaster it that it shall only appear as a subordinate, secondary concern of\nlife. But all this agrees with the fact that the sexual passion is the\nkernel of the will to live, and consequently the concentration of all\ndesire; therefore in the text I have called the genital organs the focus\nof the will. Indeed, one may say man is concrete sexual desire; for his\norigin is an act of copulation and his wish of wishes is an act of\ncopulation, and this tendency alone perpetuates and holds together his\nwhole phenomenal existence. The will to live manifests itself indeed\nprimarily as an effort to sustain the individual; yet this is only a step\nto the effort to sustain the species, and the latter endeavour must be\nmore powerful in proportion as the life of the species surpasses that of\nthe individual in duration, extension, and value. Therefore sexual passion\nis the most perfect manifestation of the will to live, its most distinctly\nexpressed type; and the origin of the individual in it, and its primacy\nover all other desires of the natural man, are both in complete agreement\nwith this.\n\nOne other remark of a physiological nature is in place here, a remark\nwhich throws light upon my fundamental doctrine expounded in the second\nbook. As the sexual impulse is the most vehement of desires, the wish of\nwishes, the concentration of all our volition, and accordingly the\nsatisfaction of it which exactly corresponds to the individual wish of any\none, that is, the desire fixed upon a definite individual, is the summit\nand crown of his happiness, the ultimate goal of his natural endeavours,\nwith the attainment of which everything seems to him to have been\nattained, and with the frustrating of which everything seems to him to\nhave been lost:—so we find, as its physiological correlative, in the\nobjectified will, thus in the human organism, the sperm or semen as the\nsecretion of secretions, the quintessence of all animal fluids, the last\nresult of all organic functions, and have in it a new proof of the fact\nthat the body is only the objectivity of the will, _i.e._, is the will\nitself under the form of the idea.\n\nWith reproduction is connected the maintenance of the offspring, and with\nthe sexual impulse, parental love; and thus through these the life of the\nspecies is carried on. Accordingly the love of the brute for its young\nhas, like the sexual impulse, a strength which far surpasses that of the\nefforts which merely concerns itself as an individual. This shows itself\nin the fact that even the mildest animals are ready to undertake for the\nsake of their young even the most unequal battle for life and death, and\nwith almost all species of animals the mother encounters any danger for\nthe protection of her young, nay, in many cases even faces certain death.\nIn the case of man this instinctive parental love is guided and directed\nby reason, _i.e._, by reflection. Sometimes, however, it is also in this\nway restricted, and with bad characters this may extend to the complete\nrepudiation of it. Therefore we can observe its effects most purely in the\nlower animals. In itself, however, it is not less strong in man; here\nalso, in particular cases, we see it entirely overcome self‐love, and even\nextend to the sacrifice of life. Thus, for example, the French newspapers\nhave just announced that at Cahors, in the department of Lot, a father has\ntaken his own life in order that his son, who had been drawn for military\nservice, should be the eldest son of a widow, and therefore exempt\n(_Galignani’s Messenger_ of 22d June 1843). Yet in the case of the lower\nanimals, since they are capable of no reflection, the instinctive maternal\naffection (the male is generally ignorant of his paternity) shows itself\ndirectly and unsophisticated, and therefore with perfect distinctness and\nin its whole strength. At bottom it is the expression of the consciousness\nin the brute that its true being lies more immediately in the species than\nin the individual, and therefore, when necessary, it sacrifices its life\nthat the species may be maintained in the young. Thus here, as also in the\nsexual impulse, the will to live becomes to a certain extent transcendent,\nfor its consciousness extends beyond the individual, in which it is\ninherent, to the species. In order to avoid expressing this second\nmanifestation of the life of the species in a merely abstract manner, and\nto present it to the reader in its magnitude and reality, I will give a\nfew examples of the extraordinary strength of instinctive maternal\naffection.\n\nThe sea‐otter, when pursued, seizes its young one and dives with it; when\nit comes up again to take breath, it covers the young one with its body,\nand receives the harpoon of the hunter while the young one is escaping. A\nyoung whale is killed merely to attract the mother, who hurries to it and\nseldom forsakes it so long as it still lives, even although she is struck\nwith several harpoons (Scoresby’s “Journal of a Whaling Voyage;” from the\nEnglish of Kreis, p. 196). At Three Kings Island, near New Zealand, there\nare colossal seals called sea‐elephants (_phoca proboscidea_). They swim\nround the island in regular herds and feed upon fishes, but yet have\ncertain terrible enemies below water unknown to us, by whom they are often\nseverely wounded; hence their swimming together requires special tactics.\nThe females bring forth their young upon the shore; while they are\nsuckling them, which lasts from seven to eight weeks, all the males form a\ncircle round them in order to prevent them, driven by hunger, from\nentering the sea, and if this is attempted they prevent it by biting. Thus\nthey all fast together for between seven and eight weeks, and all become\nvery thin, simply in order that the young may not enter the sea before\nthey are able to swim well and observe the necessary tactics which are\nthen taught them with blows and bites (Freycinet, _Voy. aux terres\nAustrales_, 1826). We also see here how parental affection, like every\nstrong exertion of the will (_cf._ chap. xix. 6), heightens the\nintelligence. Wild ducks, white‐throats, and many other birds, when the\nsportsman comes near their nest, fly in front of him with loud cries and\nflap about as if their wings were injured, in order to attract his\nattention from their young to themselves. The lark tries to entice the dog\naway from its nest by exposing itself. In the same way hinds and does\ninduce the hunter to pursue them in order that their young may not be\nattacked. Swallows have flown into burning houses to rescue their young or\nperish with them. At Delft, in a great fire, a stork allowed itself to be\nburnt in its nest rather than forsake its tender young, which could not\nyet fly (Hadr. Junius, _Descriptio Hollandiæ_). Mountain‐cocks and\nwoodcocks allow themselves to be taken upon the nest when brooding.\n_Muscicapa tyrannus_ protects its nest with remarkable courage, and\ndefends itself against eagles. An ant has been cut in two, and the fore\nhalf been seen to bring the pupæ to a place of safety. A bitch whose\nlitter had been cut out of her belly crept up to them dying, caressed\nthem, and began to whine violently only when they were taken from her\n(Burdach, _Physiologie als Erfahrungswissenschaft_, vol. ii. and iii.).\n\nChapter XLIII. On Heredity.\n\nThe most ordinary experience teaches that in generation the combined seed\nof the parents not only propagates the peculiarities of the species, but\nalso those of the individual, as far as bodily (objective, external)\nqualities are concerned, and this has also always been recognised—\n\n    “_Naturæ sequitur semina quisque suæ._”\n\n    —CATULL.\n\nNow whether this also holds good of mental (subjective, internal)\nqualities, so that these also are transmitted by the parents to the\nchildren, is a question which has already often been raised, and almost\nalways answered in the affirmative. More difficult, however, is the\nproblem whether it is possible to distinguish what belongs to the father\nand what to the mother, thus what is the mental inheritance which we\nreceive from each of our parents. If now we cast upon this problem the\nlight of our fundamental knowledge that the will is the true being, the\nkernel, the radical element in man, and the intellect, on the other hand,\nis what is secondary, adventitious, the accident of that substance; before\nquestioning experience we will assume it as at least probable that the\nfather, as _sexus potior_ and the procreative principle, imparts the\nbasis, the radical element, of the new life, thus the _will_, and the\nmother, as _sexus sequior_ and merely conceiving principle, imparts the\nsecondary element, the _intellect_; that thus the man inherits his moral\nnature, his character, his inclinations, his heart, from the father, and,\non the other hand, the grade, quality, and tendency of his intelligence\nfrom the mother. Now this assumption actually finds its confirmation in\nexperience; only this cannot be decided by a physical experiment upon the\ntable, but results partly from the careful and acute observation of many\nyears, and partly from history.\n\nOne’s own experience has the advantage of complete certainty and the\ngreatest speciality, and this outweighs the disadvantage that arises from\nit, that its sphere is limited and its examples not generally known.\nTherefore, primarily, I refer every one to his own experience. First of\nall let him consider himself, confess to himself his inclinations and\npassions, his characteristic errors and weaknesses, his vices, and also\nhis excellences and virtues, if he has any. Then let him think of his\nfather, and he cannot fail to recognise all these characteristic traits in\nhim also. On the other hand, he will often find his mother of an entirely\ndifferent character, and a moral agreement with her will very seldom\noccur, indeed only through the exceptional accident of a similarity of the\ncharacter of the two parents. Let him make this examination, for example,\nwith reference to quick temper or patience, avarice or prodigality,\ninclination to sensuality, or to intemperance, or to gambling, hard‐\nheartedness or kindliness, honesty or hypocrisy, pride or condescension,\ncourage or cowardice, peaceableness or quarrelsomeness, placability or\nresentfulness, &c. Then let him make the same investigation with regard to\nall those whose characters and whose parents he has accurately known. If\nhe proceeds attentively, with correct judgment, and candidly, the\nconfirmation of our principle will not be lacking. Thus, for example, he\nwill find the special tendency to lie, which belongs to many men, equally\npresent in two brothers, because they have inherited it from the father;\non this account also the comedy, “The Liar and his Son,” is\npsychologically correct. However, two inevitable limitations must here be\nborne in mind, which only open injustice could interpret as evasions.\nFirst, _pater semper incertus_. Only a decided physical resemblance to the\nfather removes this limitation; a superficial resemblance, on the other\nhand, is not sufficient to do so; for there is an after‐effect of earlier\nimpregnation by virtue of which the children of the second marriage have\nsometimes still a slight resemblance to the first husband, and children\nbegotten in adultery to the legitimate father. Such an after‐effect has\nbeen still more distinctly observed in the case of brutes. The second\nlimitation is, that in the son the moral character of the father certainly\nappears, yet under the modification which it has received through another\nand often very different _intellect_ (the inheritance from the mother),\nand thus a correction of the observation becomes necessary. This\nmodification may be important or trifling in proportion to that\ndifference, but it can never be so great that the fundamental traits of\nthe paternal character do not always appear under it recognisably enough,\nlike a man who has disguised himself by an entirely different kind of\ndress, wig, and beard. For example, if by inheritance from the mother a\nman is pre‐eminently endowed with reason, thus with the power of\nreflection and deliberation, the passions inherited from his father are\npartly bridled by this, partly concealed, and accordingly only attain to a\nmethodical, systematic, or secret manifestation, and thus a very different\nphenomenon from that of the father, who perhaps had only a very limited\nmind, will then result; and in the same way the converse case may occur.\nThe inclinations and passions of the mother, on the other hand, do not\nreappear at all in the children, often indeed their opposite.\n\nHistorical examples have the advantage over those of private life of being\nuniversally known; but, on the other hand, they are of course impaired by\nthe uncertainty and frequent falsification of all tradition, and\nespecially also by the fact that as a rule they only contain the public,\nnot the private life, and consequently only the political actions, not the\nfiner manifestations of character. However, I wish to support the truth we\nare speaking of by a few historical examples, to which those who have made\na special study of history can no doubt add a far larger number of equally\npertinent cases.\n\nIt is well known that P. Decius Mus sacrificed his life for his country\nwith heroic nobleness; for, solemnly committing himself and the enemy to\nthe infernal deities, with covered face he plunged into the army of the\nLatins. About forty years later his son, of the same name, did exactly the\nsame thing in the war against the Gauls (Liv. viii. 6; x. 28). Thus a\nthorough proof of the Horatian _fortes creantur fortibus et bonis_: the\nconverse of which is thus given by Shakspeare—\n\n    “Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base.”\n\n    —CYMBELINE, iv. 2.\n\nEarly Roman history presents to us whole families whose members in long\nsuccession distinguished themselves by devoted patriotism and courage;\nsuch were the _gens Fabia_ and the _gens Fabricia_. Again, Alexander the\nGreat was fond of power and conquest, like his father Philip. The pedigree\nof Nero which, with a moral intention, Suetonius (c. 4 _et_ 5) gives at\nthe beginning of his sketch of this monster is very well worth\nconsidering. It is the _gens Claudia_ he describes, which flourished in\nRome through six centuries, and produced not only capable, but arrogant\nand cruel men. From it sprang Tiberius, Caligula, and finally Nero. In his\ngrandfather, and still more strongly in his father, all those atrocious\nqualities show themselves, which could only attain their perfect\ndevelopment in Nero, partly because his higher position afforded them\nfreer scope, partly because he had for his mother the irrational\nBacchante, Agrippina, who could impart to him no intellect to bridle his\npassions. Quite in our sense, therefore, Suetonius relates that at his\nbirth _præsagio fuit etiam Domitii, patris, vox, inter gratulationes\namicorum, negantis, quidquam ex se __ et Agrippina, nisi detestabile et\nmalo publico nasci potuisse_. On the other hand, Cimon was the son of\nMiltiades, and Hannibal of Hamilcar, and the Scipios make up a whole\nfamily of heroes and noble defenders of their country. But the son of Pope\nAlexander VI. was his hideous image, Cæsar Borgia. The son of the\nnotorious Duke of Alba was just as cruel and wicked a man as his father.\nThe malicious and unjust Philip IV. of France, who is specially known by\nhis cruel torture and execution of the knights templars, had for his\ndaughter Isabella, wife of Edward II. of England, who rebelled against her\nhusband, took him prisoner, and after he had signed his abdication, since\nthe attempt to kill him by ill‐usage was unsuccessful, caused him to be\nput to death in prison in a manner which is too horrible for me to care to\nrelate. The blood‐thirsty tyrant and _defensor fidei_, Henry VIII. of\nEngland had a daughter by his first marriage, Queen Mary, equally\ndistinguished for bigotry and cruelty, who from her numerous burnings of\nheretics has won the name of Bloody Mary. His daughter by his second\nmarriage, Elizabeth, received an excellent understanding from her mother,\nAnne Boleyn, which prevented bigotry and curbed the parental character in\nher, yet did not do away with it; so that it still always shone through on\noccasions, and distinctly appeared in her cruel treatment of Mary of\nScotland. Van Geuns(35) tells a story, after Marcus Donatus, of a Scotch\ngirl whose father had been burnt as a highway robber and a cannibal when\nshe was only one year old. Although she was brought up among quite\ndifferent people, there developed in her the same craving for human flesh,\nand being caught in the act of satisfying it, she was buried alive. In the\n_Freimüthigen_ of the 13th July 1821 we read that in the department of\nAube the police pursued a girl because she had murdered two children, whom\nshe ought to have taken to the foundling hospital, in order to keep the\nlittle money given to the children. At last the police found the girl on\nthe road to Paris, near Romilly, drowned, and her own father gave himself\nup as her murderer. Finally, let me mention a couple of cases which have\noccurred recently, and have therefore only the newspapers as their\nvouchers. In October 1836 a Count Belecznai was condemned to death in\nHungary because he had murdered an official and severely wounded his own\nrelations. His elder brother was executed earlier as a patricide, and his\nfather also had been a murderer (_Frankfurter Postzeitung_ of the 26th\nOctober 1836). A year later the youngest brother of this Count, in the\nsame street where the latter had murdered the official, fired a pistol at\nthe steward of his estates, but missed him (_Frankfurter Journal_, 16th\nSeptember 1837). In the _Frankfurter Postzeitung_ of the 19th November\n1857 a correspondent in Paris announces the condemnation to death of a\nvery dangerous highway robber, Lemaire, and his companions, and adds: “The\ncriminal tendency seems hereditary in his family and in those of his\nconfederates, as several of their race have died on the scaffold.” It\nfollows from a passage in the Laws of Plato that similar cases were\nalready known in Greece (_Stob. Flor._, vol. ii. p. 213). The annals of\ncrime will certainly have many similar pedigrees to show. The tendency to\nsuicide is specially hereditary.\n\nOn the other hand, when we see the excellent Marcus Aurelius have the\nwicked Commodus for a son, this does not not lead us astray; for we know\nthat the _Diva Faustina_ was a _uxor infamis_. On the contrary, we mark\nthis case in order in analogous cases to presume an analogous reason; for\nexample, that Domitian was the full brother of Titus I can never believe,\nbut that Vespasian also was a deceived husband.\n\nNow, as regards the second part of the principle set up thus the\ninheritance of the intellect from the mother, this enjoys a far more\ngeneral acceptance than the first part, which in itself appeals to the\n_liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ_, while its separate apprehension is\nopposed by the doctrine of the simplicity and indivisibility of the soul.\nEven the old and popular expression “mother‐wit” shows the early\nrecognition of this second truth, which depends upon the experience both\nwith regard to small and great intellectual endowments, that they are the\npossession of those whose mothers proportionately distinguished themselves\nby their intelligence. That, on the other hand, the intellectual qualities\nof the father are not transmitted to the son is proved both by the fathers\nand the sons of men distinguished by the most eminent faculties, for, as a\nrule, they are quite ordinary men, without a trace of the paternal mental\ngifts. But if now an isolated exception to this experience, so often\nconfirmed, should appear; such, for example, as is presented by Pitt and\nhis father, Lord Chatham, we are warranted in ascribing it to accident,\nnay, obliged to do so, although, on account of the exceptional rarity of\ngreat talents, it is certainly an accident of a most extraordinary kind.\nHere, however, the rule holds good: it is improbable that the improbable\n_never_ happens. Besides, great statesmen (as was already mentioned in\nchapter 22) are so just as much through the qualities of their character,\nthus through what is inherited from the father, as through the superiority\nof their mind. On the other hand, among artists, poets, and philosophers,\nto whose works alone _genius_ is properly ascribed, I know of no case\nanalogous to that. Raphael’s father was certainly a painter, but not a\ngreat one; Mozart’s father, and also his son, were musicians, but not\ngreat ones. However, it is indeed wonderful that the fate which had\ndestined a very short life to both of these men, each the greatest in his\nown sphere, as it were by way of compensation, took care, by letting them\nbe born already in their workshop, that, without suffering the loss of\ntime in youth which for the most part occurs in the case of other men of\ngenius, they received even from childhood, through paternal example and\ninstruction, the necessary introduction into the art to which they were\nexclusively destined. This secret and mysterious power which seems to\nguide the individual life I have made the subject of special\ninvestigations, which I have communicated in the essay, “_Ueber die\nscheinbare Absichtlichkeit im Schicksale des Einzelnen_” (_Parerga_, vol.\ni.). It is further to be observed here that there are certain scientific\noccupations which certainly presuppose good native faculties, yet not\nthose which are really rare and extraordinary; while the principal\nrequirements are zealous efforts, diligence, patience, early instruction,\nsustained study, and much practice. From this, and not from the\ninheritance of the intellect of the father, the fact is to be explained\nthat, since the son always willingly follows the path that has been opened\nup by the father, and almost all businesses are hereditary in certain\nfamilies, in some sciences also, which before everything demand diligence\nand persistence, individual families can show a succession of men of\nmerit; such are the Scaligers, the Bernouillis, the Cassinis, the\nHerschels.\n\nThe number of proofs of the actual inheritance of the intellect of the\nmother would be much greater than it appears if it were not that the\ncharacter and disposition of the female sex is such that women rarely give\npublic proof of their mental faculties; and therefore these do not become\nhistorical, and thus known to posterity. Besides, on account of the weaker\nnature in general of the female sex, these faculties themselves can never\nreach the grade in them to which they may afterwards rise in the son;\nthus, with reference to themselves, we have to estimate their achievements\nhigher in this proportion. Accordingly, in the first instance, only the\nfollowing examples present themselves as proofs of our truth. Joseph II.\nwas the son of Maria Theresia. Cardanus says in the third chapter, “_De\nvita propria_:” “_Mater mea fuit memoria et ingenio pollens_.” J. J.\nRousseau says in the first book of the “Confessions:” “_La beauté de ma\nmère, son __ esprit, ses talents,—elle en avait de trop brillans pour son\nétat_,” &c., and then quotes some delightful lines of hers. D’Alembert was\nthe illegitimate son of Claudine de Tencin, a woman of superior mind, and\nthe author of several romances and similar works, which met with great\napprobation in her day, and should even still be enjoyable (see her\nbiography in the “_Blätter für litterarische Unterhaltung_,” March 1845,\nNos. 71‐73). That Buffon’s mother was a remarkable woman is shown by the\nfollowing passage from the “_Voyage à Montbar, par Hérault de Sechelles_,”\nwhich Flourens quotes in his “_Histoire des travaux de Buffon_,” p. 288:\n“_Buffon avait ce principe qu’en général les enfants tenaient de leur mère\nleurs qualités intellectuelles et morales: et lorsqu’il l’avait développé\ndans la conversation, il en faisait sur‐le‐champ l’application à lui‐même,\nen faisant un éloge pompeux de sa mère, qui avait en effet, beaucoup\nd’esprit, des connaissances étandues, et une tête très bien organisée._”\nThat he includes the moral qualities is an error which is either committed\nby the reporter, or depends upon the fact that his mother had accidentally\nthe same character as himself and his father. The contrary of this is\nshown in innumerable cases in which the mother and the son have opposite\ncharacters. Hence the greatest dramatists could present, in Orestes and\nHamlet, mother and son in hostile conflict, in which the son appears as\nthe moral representative and avenger of his father. On the other hand, the\nconverse case, that the son should appear as the moral representative and\navenger of the mother against the father, would be revolting and, at the\nsame time, almost absurd. This depends upon the fact that between father\nand son there is actual identity of nature, which is the will, but between\nmother and son there is merely identity of intellect, and even this only\nin a conditioned manner. Between mother and son the greatest moral\nopposition can exist, between father and son only an intellectual\nopposition. From this point of view, also, one should recognise the\nnecessity of the Salic law: the woman cannot carry on the race. Hume says\nin his short autobiography: “Our mother was a woman of singular merit.” It\nis said of Kant’s mother in the most recent biography by F. W. Schubert:\n“According to the judgment of her son himself, she was a woman of great\nnatural understanding. For that time, when there was so little opportunity\nfor the education of girls, she was exceptionally well instructed, and she\nalso continued later to care for her further education by herself. In the\ncourse of walks she drew the attention of her son to all kinds of natural\nphenomena, and tried to explain to him through them the power of God.”\nWhat a remarkably able, clever, and superior woman Goethe’s mother was is\nnow universally known. How much she has been spoken of in literature!\nwhile his father has not been spoken of at all; Goethe himself describes\nhim as a man of subordinate faculties. Schiller’s mother was susceptible\nto poetry, and made verses herself, a fragment of which will be found in\nhis biography by Schwab. Bürger, that genuine poetic genius, to whom\nperhaps the first place after Goethe among German poets belongs—for\ncompared with his ballads those of Schiller seem cold and laboured—has\ngiven an account of his parents which for us is significant, and which his\nfriend and physician, Althof repeats in his biography which appeared in\n1798, in these words: “Bürger’s father was certainly provided with a\nvariety of knowledge after the manner of study prevalent at the time, and\nwas also a good, honourable man; but he loved his quiet comfort and his\npipe of tobacco so much, that, as my friend used to say, he had always\nfirst to pull himself together if he was going to apply himself for a\nquarter of an hour or so to the instruction of his son. His wife was a\nwoman of extraordinary mental endowments, which, however, were so little\ncultivated that she had scarcely learnt to write legibly. Bürger thought\nthat with proper culture his mother would have been the most famous of her\nsex, although he several times expressed a strong disapproval of different\ntraits of her moral character. However, he believed that he inherited from\nhis mother some mental gifts, and from his father an agreement with his\nmoral character.” Walter Scott’s mother was a poetess, and was in\ncommunication with the wits of her time, as we learn from the obituary\nnotice of Walter Scott in the _Globe_ of 24th September 1832. That poems\nof hers appeared in print in 1789 I find from an article entitled “Mother‐\nwit,” in the _Blätter für litterarische Unterhaltung_ of 4th October 1841,\npublished by Brockhaus, which gives a long list of clever mothers of\ndistinguished men, from which I shall only take two: “Bacon’s mother was a\ndistinguished linguist, wrote and translated several works, and in all of\nthem showed learning, acuteness, and taste. Boerhave’s mother\ndistinguished herself through medical knowledge.” On the other hand,\nHaller has preserved for us a strong proof of the inheritance of the\nmental weakness of the mother, for he says: “_E duabus patriciis\nsororibus, ob divitias maritos nactis, quum tamen fatuis essent proximæ,\nnovimus in nobilissimas gentes nunc a seculo retro ejus morbi manasse\nsemina, ut etiam in quarta generatione, quintave, omnium posterorum aliqui\nfatui supersint_” (_Elementa physiol._, Lib. xxix. § 8). Also, according\nto Esquirol, madness is more frequently inherited from the mother than the\nfather. If, however, it is inherited from the father, I attribute this to\nthe disposition of the character whose influence occasions it.\n\nIt seems to follow from our principle that sons of the same mother have\nequal mental capacity, and if one should be highly gifted the other must\nbe so also. Sometimes it is so. Examples of this are the Carracci, Joseph\nand Michael Haydn, Bernard and Andreas Romberg, George and Frederic\nCuvier. I would also add the brothers Schlegel, if it were not that the\nyounger, Friedrich, made himself unworthy of the honour of being named\nalong with his excellent, blameless, and highly distinguished brother,\nAugust Wilhelm, by the disgraceful obscurantism which in the last quarter\nof his life he pursued along with Adam Müller. For obscurantism is a sin,\npossibly not against the Holy Spirit, but yet against the human spirit,\nwhich one ought therefore never to forgive, but always and everywhere\nimplacably to remember against whoever has been guilty of it, and take\nevery opportunity of showing contempt for him so long as he lives, nay,\nafter he is dead. But just as often the above result does not take place;\nfor example, Kant’s brother was quite an ordinary man. To explain this I\nmust remind the reader of what is said in the thirty‐first chapter on the\nphysiological conditions of genius. Not only an extraordinarily developed\nand absolutely correctly formed brain (the share of the mother) is\nrequired, but also a very energetic action of the heart to animate it,\n_i.e._, subjectively a passionate will, a lively temperament: this is the\ninheritance from the father. But this quality is at its height only during\nthe father’s strongest years; and the mother ages still more quickly.\nAccordingly the highly gifted sons will, as a rule, be the eldest,\nbegotten in the full strength of both parents; thus Kant’s brother was\neleven years younger than him. Even in the case of two distinguished\nbrothers, as a rule, the elder will be the superior. But not only the age,\nbut every temporary ebb of the vital force or other disturbance of health\nin the parents at the time when the child is begotten may interfere with\nthe part of one or other, and prevent the appearance of a man of eminent\ntalent, which is therefore so exceedingly rare a phenomenon. It may be\nsaid, in passing, that in the case of twins the absence of all the\ndifferences just mentioned is the cause of the quasi‐identity of their\nnature.\n\nIf single cases should be found in which a highly gifted son had a mother\nwho was not mentally distinguished at all, this may be explained from the\nfact that this mother herself had a phlegmatic father, and on this account\nher more than ordinarily developed brain was not adequately excited by a\ncorresponding energy of the circulation—a necessary condition, as I have\nexplained above in chapter 31. Nevertheless, her highly perfected nervous\nand cerebral system was transmitted to the son, in whose case a father\nwith a lively and passionate disposition and an energetic action of the\nheart was added, and thus the other physical condition of great mental\npower first appeared here. Perhaps this was Byron’s case, since we nowhere\nfind the mental advantages of his mother mentioned. The same explanation\nis also to be applied to the case in which the mother of a son of genius\nwho was herself distinguished for mental gifts had a mother who was by no\nmeans clever, for the father of the latter has been a man of a phlegmatic\ndisposition.\n\nThe inharmonious, disproportionate, ambiguous element in the character of\nmost men might perhaps be referred to the fact that the individual has not\na simple origin, but derives the will from the father and the intellect\nfrom the mother. The more heterogeneous and ill‐adapted to each other the\ntwo parents were, the greater will that want of harmony, that inner\nvariance, be. While some excel through their heart and others through\ntheir head, there are still others whose excellence lies in a certain\nharmony and unity of the whole nature, which arises from the fact that in\nthem heart and head are so thoroughly adapted that they mutually support\nand advance each other; which leads us to assume that the parents were\npeculiarly suited to each other, and agreed in an exceptional measure.\n\nWith reference to the physiological side of the theory set forth, I wish\nnow to mention that Burdach, who erroneously assumes that the same\npsychical qualities may be inherited now from the father, now from the\nmother, yet adds (_Physiologie als Erfahrungswissenschaft_, vol. i. §\n306): “As a whole, the male element has more influence in determining the\nirritable life, and the female element, on the other hand, has more\ninfluence on the sensibility.” What Linné says in the “_Systema naturæ_,”\nTom. i. p. 8, is also in point here: “_Mater prolifera promit, ante\ngenerationem, __ vivum compendium medullare novi animalis suique\nsimillimi, carinam Malpighianam dictum, tanquam plumulam vegetabilium: hoc\nex genitura Cor adsociat ramificandum in corpus. Punctum emin saliens ovi\nincubantis avis ostendit primum cor micans, cerebrumque cum medulla:\ncorculum hoc, cessans a frigore, excitatur calido halitu, premitque bulla\naërea, sensim dilatata, liquores, secundum canales fluxiles. Punctum\nvitalitatis itaque in viventibus est tanquam a prima creatione continuata\nmedullaris vitæ ramificatio, cum ovum sit gemma medullaris matris a\nprimordio viva, licet non sua ante proprium cor paternum._”\n\nIf we now connect the conviction we have gained here of the inheritance of\nthe character from the father and the intellect from the mother with our\nearlier investigation of the wide gulf which nature has placed between man\nand man in a moral as in an intellectual regard, and also with our\nknowledge of the absolute unalterableness both of the character and of the\nmental faculties, we shall be led to the view that a real and thorough\nimprovement of the human race might be attained to not so much from\nwithout as from within, thus not so much by instruction and culture as\nrather upon the path of generation. Plato had already something of the\nkind in his mind when in the fifth book of his Republic he set forth his\nwonderful plan for increasing and improving his class of warriors. If we\ncould castrate all scoundrels, and shut up all stupid geese in\nmonasteries, and give persons of noble character a whole harem, and\nprovide men, and indeed complete men, for all maidens of mind and\nunderstanding, a generation would soon arise which would produce a better\nage than that of Pericles. But, without entering into such utopian plans,\nit might be taken into consideration that if, as, if I am not mistaken,\nwas actually the case among certain ancient nations, castration was the\nseverest punishment after death, the world would be delivered from whole\nraces of scoundrels, all the more certainly as it is well known that most\ncrimes are committed between the age of twenty and thirty.(36) In the same\nway, it might be considered whether, as regards results, it would not be\nmore advantageous to give the public dowries which upon certain occasions\nhave to be distributed, not, as is now customary, to the girls who are\nsupposed to be the most virtuous, but to those who have most understanding\nand are the cleverest; especially as it is very difficult to judge as to\nvirtue, for, as it is said, only God sees the heart. The opportunities for\ndisplaying a noble character are rare, and a matter of chance; besides,\nmany a girl has a powerful support to her virtue in her plainness; on the\nother hand, as regards understanding, those who themselves are gifted with\nit can judge with great certainty after some examination. The following is\nanother practical application. In many countries, among others in South\nGermany, the bad custom prevails of women carrying burdens, often very\nconsiderable, upon the head. This must act disadvantageously upon the\nbrain, which must thereby gradually deteriorate in the female sex of the\nnation; and since from that sex the male sex receives its brain, the whole\nnation becomes ever more stupid; which in many cases is by no means\nnecessary. Accordingly by the abolition of this custom the quantum of\nintelligence in the whole nation would be increased, which would\npositively be the greatest increase of the national wealth.\n\nBut if now, leaving such practical applications to others, we return to\nour special point of view, the ethico‐metaphysical standpoint—since we\nconnect the content of chapter 41 with that of the present chapter—the\nfollowing result will present itself to us, which, with all its\ntranscendence, has yet a direct empirical support. It is the same\ncharacter, thus the same individually determined will, that lives in all\nthe descendants of one stock, from the remote ancestor to the present\nrepresentative of the family. But in each of these a different intellect\nis given with it, thus a different degree and a different kind of\nknowledge. Thus in each of these life presents itself to it from another\nside and in a different light: it receives a new fundamental view of it, a\nnew instruction. It is true that, since the intellect is extinguished with\nthe individual, that will cannot supplement the insight of one course of\nlife with that of another. But in consequence of each fundamentally new\nview of life, such as only a renewed personality can impart to it, its\nwilling itself receives a different tendency, thus experiences a\nmodification from it, and what is the chief concern, the will, has, in\nthis new direction, either to assert life anew or deny it. In this way\ndoes the arrangement of nature of an ever‐changing connection of a will\nwith an intellect, which arises from the necessity of two sexes for\nreproduction, become the basis of a method of salvation. For by virtue of\nthis arrangement life unceasingly presents new sides to the will (whose\nimage and mirror it is), turns itself about, as it were, without\nintermission before its sight, allows different and ever different modes\nof perception to try their effect upon it, so that upon each of these it\nmust decide for assertion or denial, both of which constantly stand open\nto it, only that, if once denial is chosen, the whole phenomenon ceases\nfor it with death. Now because, according to this, it is just the constant\nrenewal and complete alteration of the intellect for the same will which,\nas imparting a new view of the world, holds open the path of salvation,\nand because the intellect comes from the mother, the profound reason may\nlie here on account of which all nations (with very few and doubtful\nexceptions) abominate and forbid the marriage of brothers and sisters,\nnay, even on account of which sexual love does not arise at all between\nbrothers and sisters, unless in very rare exceptions, which depend upon an\nunnatural perversity of the instinct, if not upon the fact that one of the\ntwo is illegitimate. For from a marriage of brothers and sisters nothing\ncould proceed but constantly ever the same will with the same intellect,\nas both already exist united in both the parents, thus the hopeless\nrepetition of the phenomenon which has already been.\n\nBut if now, in the particular case and close at hand, we contemplate the\nincredibly great and yet manifest difference of characters—find one so\ngood and philanthropic, another so wicked, nay, ferocious; again, behold\none just, honest, and upright, and another completely false, as a sneak, a\nswindler, a traitor, an incorrigible scoundrel—there discloses itself to\nus a chasm in our investigation, for in vain we ponder, reflecting on the\norigin of such a difference. Hindus and Buddhists solve the problem by\nsaying, “It is the consequence of the deeds of the preceding courses of\nlife.” This solution is certainly the oldest, also the most\ncomprehensible, and has come from the wisest of mankind; but it only\npushes the question further back. Yet a more satisfactory answer will\nhardly be found. From the point of view of my whole teaching, it remains\nfor me to say that here, where we are speaking of the will as thing in\nitself, the principle of sufficient reason, as merely the form of the\nphenomenon, is no longer applicable; with it, however, all why and whence\ndisappear. Absolute freedom just consists in this, that something is not\nsubject at all to the principle of sufficient reason, as the principle of\nall necessity. Such freedom, therefore, only belongs to the thing in\nitself. And this is just the will. Accordingly, in its phenomenal\nmanifestation, consequently in the _Operari_, it is subject to necessity;\nbut in the _Esse_, where it has determined itself as thing in itself, it\nis free. Whenever, therefore, we come to this, as happens here, all\nexplanation by means of reasons and consequents ceases, and nothing\nremains for us but to say that here manifests itself the true freedom of\nthe will, which belongs to it because it is the thing in itself, which,\nhowever, just as such, is groundless, _i.e._, knows no why. But on this\naccount all understanding ceases for us here, because all our\nunderstanding depends upon the principle of sufficient reason, for it\nconsists in the mere application of that principle.\n\nChapter XLIV. The Metaphysics Of The Love Of The Sexes.\n\n    “Ye wise men, highly, deeply learned,\n    Who think it out and know,\n    How, when, and where do all things pair?\n    Why do they kiss and love?\n    Ye men of lofty wisdom, say\n    What happened to me then;\n    Search out and tell me where, how, when,\n    And why it happened thus.”\n\n    —BÜRGER.\n\nThis chapter is the last of four whose various reciprocal relations, by\nvirtue of which, to a certain extent, they constitute a subordinate whole,\nthe attentive reader will recognise without it being needful for me to\ninterrupt my exposition by recalling them or referring to them.\n\nWe are accustomed to see poets principally occupied with describing the\nlove of the sexes. This is as a rule the chief theme of all dramatic\nworks, tragical as well as comical, romantic as well as classical, Indian\nas well as European. Not less is it the material of by far the largest\npart of lyrical and also of epic poetry, especially if we class with the\nlatter the enormous piles of romances which for centuries every year has\nproduced in all the civilised countries of Europe as regularly as the\nfruits of the earth. As regards their main \n\nCertainly, however, it is also confirmed by experience, although not by\nthe experience of every day, that that which as a rule only appears as a\nstrong yet still controllable inclination may rise under certain\ncircumstances to a passion which exceeds all others in vehemence, and\nwhich then sets aside all considerations, overcomes all obstacles with\nincredible strength and perseverance, so that for its satisfaction life is\nrisked without hesitation, nay, if that satisfaction is still withheld, is\ngiven as the price of it. Werthers and Jacopo Ortis exist not only in\nromance, but every year can show at least half a dozen of them in Europe:\n_Sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi_; for their sorrows find no other\nchroniclers than the writers of official registers or the reporters of the\nnewspapers. Yet the readers of the police news in English and French\njournals will attest the correctness of my assertion. Still greater,\nhowever, is the number of those whom the same passion brings to the\nmadhouse. Finally, every year can show cases of the double suicide of a\npair of lovers who are opposed by outward circumstances. In such cases,\nhowever, it is inexplicable to me how those who, certain of mutual love,\nexpect to find the supremest bliss in the enjoyment of this, do not\nwithdraw themselves from all connections by taking the extremest steps,\nand endure all hardships, rather than give up with life a pleasure which\nis greater than any other they can conceive. As regards the lower grades\nof that passion, and the mere approaches to it, every one has them daily\nbefore his eyes, and, as long as he is not old, for the most part also in\nhis heart.\n\nSo then, after what has here been called to mind, no one can doubt either\nthe reality or the importance of the matter; and therefore, instead of\nwondering that a philosophy should also for once make its own this\nconstant theme of all poets, one ought rather to be surprised that a thing\nwhich plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto\npractically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before\nus as raw material. The one who has most concerned himself with it is\nPlato, especially in the “Symposium” and the “Phædrus.” Yet what he says\non the subject is confined to the sphere of myths, fables, and jokes, and\nalso for the most part concerns only the Greek love of youths. The little\nthat Rousseau says upon our theme in the “_Discours sur l’inégalité_” (p.\n96, ed. Bip.) is false and insufficient. Kant’s explanation of the subject\nin the third part of the essay, “_Ueber das Gefühl des Schönen und\nErhabenen_” (p. 435 _seq._ of Rosenkranz’s edition), is very superficial\nand without practical knowledge, therefore it is also partly incorrect.\nLastly, Platner’s treatment of the matter in his “Anthropology” (§ 1347\n_seq._) every one will find dull and shallow. On the other hand, Spinoza’s\ndefinition, on account of its excessive naïveté, deserves to be quoted for\nthe sake of amusement: “_Amor est titillatio, concomitante idea causæ\nexternæ_” (_Eth._ iv., prop. 44, _dem._) Accordingly I have no\npredecessors either to make use of or to refute. The subject has pressed\nitself upon me objectively, and has entered of its own accord into the\nconnection of my consideration of the world. Moreover, least of all can I\nhope for approbation from those who are themselves under the power of this\npassion, and who accordingly seek to express the excess of their feelings\nin the sublimest and most ethereal images. To them my view will appear too\nphysical, too material, however metaphysical and even transcendent it may\nbe at bottom. Meanwhile let them reflect that if the object which to‐day\ninspires them to write madrigals and sonnets had been born eighteen years\nearlier it would scarcely have won a glance from them.\n\nFor all love, however ethereally it may bear itself, is rooted in the\nsexual impulse alone, nay, it absolutely is only a more definitely\ndetermined, specialised, and indeed in the strictest sense individualised\nsexual impulse. If now, keeping this in view, one considers the important\npart which the sexual impulse in all its degrees and nuances plays not\nonly on the stage and in novels, but also in the real world, where, next\nto the love of life, it shows itself the strongest and most powerful of\nmotives, constantly lays claim to half the powers and thoughts of the\nyounger portion of mankind, is the ultimate goal of almost all human\neffort, exerts an adverse influence on the most important events,\ninterrupts the most serious occupations every hour, sometimes embarrasses\nfor a while even the greatest minds, does not hesitate to intrude with its\ntrash interfering with the negotiations of statesmen and the\ninvestigations of men of learning, knows how to slip its love letters and\nlocks of hair even into ministerial portfolios and philosophical\nmanuscripts, and no less devises daily the most entangled and the worst\nactions, destroys the most valuable relationships, breaks the firmest\nbonds, demands the sacrifice sometimes of life or health, sometimes of\nwealth, rank, and happiness, nay, robs those who are otherwise honest of\nall conscience, makes those who have hitherto been faithful, traitors;\naccordingly, on the whole, appears as a malevolent demon that strives to\npervert, confuse, and overthrow everything;—then one will be forced to\ncry, Wherefore all this noise? Wherefore the straining and storming, the\nanxiety and want? It is merely a question of every Hans finding his\nGrethe.(37) Why should such a trifle play so important a part, and\nconstantly introduce disturbance and confusion into the well‐regulated\nlife of man? But to the earnest investigator the spirit of truth gradually\nreveals the answer. It is no trifle that is in question here; on the\ncontrary, the importance of the matter is quite proportionate to the\nseriousness and ardour of the effort. The ultimate end of all love\naffairs, whether they are played in sock or cothurnus, is really more\nimportant than all other ends of human life, and is therefore quite worthy\nof the profound seriousness with which every one pursues it. That which is\ndecided by it is nothing less than _the composition of the next\ngeneration_. The _dramatis personæ_ who shall appear when we are withdrawn\nare here determined, both as regards their existence and their nature, by\nthese frivolous love affairs. As the being, the _existentia_, of these\nfuture persons is absolutely conditioned by our sexual impulse generally,\nso their nature, _essentia_, is determined by the individual selection in\nits satisfaction, _i.e._, by sexual love, and is in every respect\nirrevocably fixed by this. This is the key of the problem: we shall arrive\nat a more accurate knowledge of it in its application if we go through the\ndegrees of love, from the passing inclination to the vehement passion,\nwhen we shall also recognise that the difference of these grades arises\nfrom the degree of the individualisation of the choice.\n\nThe collective love affairs of the present generation taken together are\naccordingly, of the whole human race, the serious _meditatio compositionis\ngenerationis futuræ, e qua iterum pendent innumeræ generationes_. This\nhigh importance of the matter, in which it is not a question of individual\nweal or woe, as in all other matters, but of the existence and special\nnature of the human race in future times, and therefore the will of the\nindividual appears at a higher power as the will of the species;—this it\nis on which the pathetic and sublime elements in affairs of love depend,\nwhich for thousands of years poets have never wearied of representing in\ninnumerable examples; because no theme can equal in interest this one,\nwhich stands to all others which only concern the welfare of individuals\nas the solid body to the surface, because it concerns the weal and woe of\nthe species. Just on this account, then, is it so difficult to impart\ninterest to a drama without the element of love, and, on the other hand,\nthis theme is never worn out even by daily use.\n\nThat which presents itself in the individual consciousness as sexual\nimpulse in general, without being directed towards a definite individual\nof the other sex, is in itself, and apart from the phenomenon, simply the\nwill to live. But what appears in consciousness as a sexual impulse\ndirected to a definite individual is in itself the will to live as a\ndefinitely determined individual. Now in this case the sexual impulse,\nalthough in itself a subjective need, knows how to assume very skilfully\nthe mask of an objective admiration, and thus to deceive our\nconsciousness; for nature requires this stratagem to attain its ends. But\nyet that in every case of falling in love, however objective and sublime\nthis admiration may appear, what alone is looked to is the production of\nan individual of a definite nature is primarily confirmed by the fact that\nthe essential matter is not the reciprocation of love, but possession,\n_i.e._, the physical enjoyment. The certainty of the former can therefore\nby no means console us for the want of the latter; on the contrary, in\nsuch a situation many a man has shot himself. On the other hand, persons\nwho are deeply in love, and can obtain no return of it, are contented with\npossession, _i.e._, with the physical enjoyment. This is proved by all\nforced marriages, and also by the frequent purchase of the favour of a\nwoman, in spite of her dislike, by large presents or other sacrifices,\nnay, even by cases of rape. That this particular child shall be begotten\nis, although unknown to the parties concerned, the true end of the whole\nlove story; the manner in which it is attained is a secondary\nconsideration. Now, however loudly persons of lofty and sentimental soul,\nand especially those who are in love, may cry out here about the gross\nrealism of my view, they are yet in error. For is not the definite\ndetermination of the individualities of the next generation a much higher\nand more worthy end than those exuberant feelings and super‐sensible soap\nbubbles of theirs? Nay, among earthly aims, can there be one which is\ngreater or more important? It alone corresponds to the profoundness with\nwhich passionate love is felt, to the seriousness with which it appears,\nand the importance which it attributes even to the trifling details of its\nsphere and occasion. Only so far as this end is assumed as the true one do\nthe difficulties encountered, the infinite exertions and annoyances made\nand endured for the attainment of the loved object, appear proportionate\nto the matter. For it is the future generation, in its whole individual\ndeterminateness, that presses into existence by means of those efforts and\ntoils. Nay, it is itself already active in that careful, definite, and\narbitrary choice for the satisfaction of the sexual impulse which we call\nlove. The growing inclination of two lovers is really already the will to\nlive of the new individual which they can and desire to produce; nay, even\nin the meeting of their longing glances its new life breaks out, and\nannounces itself as a future individuality harmoniously and well composed.\nThey feel the longing for an actual union and fusing together into a\nsingle being, in order to live on only as this; and this longing receives\nits fulfilment in the child which is produced by them, as that in which\nthe qualities transmitted by them both, fused and united in one being,\nlive on. Conversely, the mutual, decided and persistent aversion between a\nman and a maid is a sign that what they could produce would only be a\nbadly organised, in itself inharmonious and unhappy being. Hence there\nlies a deeper meaning in the fact that Calderon, though he calls the\natrocious Semiramis the daughter of the air, yet introduces her as the\ndaughter of rape followed by the murder of the husband.\n\nBut, finally, what draws two individuals of different sex exclusively to\neach other with such power is the will to live, which exhibits itself in\nthe whole species, and which here anticipates in the individual which\nthese two can produce an objectification of its nature answering to its\naims. This individual will have the will, or character, from the father,\nthe intellect from the mother, and the corporisation from both; yet, for\nthe most part, the figure will take more after the father, the size after\nthe mother,—according to the law which comes out in the breeding of\nhybrids among the brutes, and principally depends upon the fact that the\nsize of the fœtus must conform to the size of the uterus. Just as\ninexplicable as the quite special individuality of any man, which is\nexclusively peculiar to him, is also the quite special and individual\npassion of two lovers; indeed at bottom the two are one and the same: the\nformer is _explicite_ what the latter was _implicite_. The moment at which\nthe parents begin to love each other—to fancy each other, as the very\nhappy English expression has it—is really to be regarded as the first\nappearance of a new individual and the true _punctum saliens_ of its life,\nand, as has been said, in the meeting and fixing of their longing glances\nthere appears the first germ of the new being, which certainly, like all\ngerms, is generally crushed out. This new individual is to a certain\nextent a new (Platonic) Idea; and now, as all Ideas strive with the\ngreatest vehemence to enter the phenomenal world, eagerly seizing for this\nend upon the matter which the law of causality divides among them all, so\nalso does this particular Idea of a human individuality strive with the\ngreatest eagerness and vehemence towards its realisation in the\nphenomenon. This eagerness and vehemence is just the passion of the two\nfuture parents for each other. It has innumerable degrees, the two\nextremes of which may at any rate be described as Αφροδιτη πανδημος and\nουρανια; in its nature, however, it is everywhere the same. On the other\nhand, it will be in degree so much the more powerful the more\n_individualised_ it is; that is, the more the loved individual is\nexclusively suited, by virtue of all his or her parts and qualities, to\nsatisfy the desire of the lover and the need established by his or her own\nindividuality. What is really in question here will become clear in the\nfurther course of our exposition. Primarily and essentially the\ninclination of love is directed to health, strength, and beauty,\nconsequently also to youth; because the will first of all seeks to exhibit\nthe specific character of the human species as the basis of all\nindividuality: ordinary amorousness (Αφροδιτη πανδημος) does not go much\nfurther. To these, then, more special claims link themselves on, which we\nshall investigate in detail further on, and with which, when they see\nsatisfaction before them, the passion increases. But the highest degrees\nof this passion spring from that suitableness of two individualities to\neach other on account of which the will, _i.e._, the character, of the\nfather and the intellect of the mother, in their connection, make up\nprecisely that individual towards which the will to live in general which\nexhibits itself in the whole species feels a longing proportionate to this\nits magnitude, and which therefore exceeds the measure of a mortal heart,\nand the motives of which, in the same way, lie beyond the sphere of the\nindividual intellect. This is thus the soul of a true and great passion.\nNow the more perfect is the mutual adaptation of two individuals to each\nother in each of the many respects which have further to be considered,\nthe stronger will be their mutual passion. Since there do not exist two\nindividuals exactly alike, there must be for each particular man a\nparticular woman—always with reference to what is to be produced—who\ncorresponds most perfectly. A really passionate love is as rare as the\naccident of these two meeting. Since, however, the possibility of such a\nlove is present in every one, the representations of it in the works of\nthe poets are comprehensible to us. Just because the passion of love\nreally turns about that which is to be produced, and its qualities, and\nbecause its kernel lies here, a friendship without any admixture of sexual\nlove can exist between two young and good‐looking persons of different\nsex, on account of the agreement of their disposition, character, and\nmental tendencies; nay, as regards sexual love there may even be a certain\naversion between them. The reason of this is to be sought in the fact that\na child produced by them would have physical or mental qualities which\nwere inharmonious; in short, its existence and nature would not answer the\nends of the will to live as it exhibits itself in the species. On the\nother hand, in the case of difference of disposition, character, and\nmental tendency, and the dislike, nay, enmity, proceeding from this,\nsexual love may yet arise and exist; when it then blinds us to all that;\nand if it here leads to marriage it will be a very unhappy one.\n\nLet us now set about the more thorough investigation of the matter. Egoism\nis so deeply rooted a quality of all individuals in general, that in order\nto rouse the activity of an individual being egoistical ends are the only\nones upon which we can count with certainty. Certainly the species has an\nearlier, closer, and greater claim upon the individual than the perishable\nindividuality itself. Yet when the individual has to act, and even make\nsacrifices for the continuance and quality of the species, the importance\nof the matter cannot be made so comprehensible to his intellect, which is\ncalculated merely with regard to individual ends, as to have its\nproportionate effect. Therefore in such a case nature can only attain its\nends by implanting a certain illusion in the individual, on account of\nwhich that which is only a good for the species appears to him as a good\nfor himself, so that when he serves the species he imagines he is serving\nhimself; in which process a mere chimera, which vanishes immediately\nafterwards, floats before him, and takes the place of a real thing as a\nmotive. This illusion is instinct. In the great majority of cases this is\nto be regarded as the sense of the species, which presents what is of\nbenefit to _it_ to the will. Since, however, the will has here become\nindividual, it must be so deluded that it apprehends through the sense of\nthe individual what the sense of the species presents to it, thus imagines\nit is following individual ends while in truth it is pursuing ends which\nare merely general (taking this word in its strictest sense). The external\nphenomenon of instinct we can best observe in the brutes where its rôle is\nmost important; but it is in ourselves alone that we arrive at a knowledge\nof its internal process, as of everything internal. Now it is certainly\nsupposed that man has almost no instinct; at any rate only this, that the\nnew‐born babe seeks for and seizes the breast of its mother. But, in fact,\nwe have a very definite, distinct, and complicated instinct, that of the\nselection of another individual for the satisfaction of the sexual\nimpulse, a selection which is so fine, so serious, and so arbitrary. With\nthis satisfaction in itself, _i.e._, so far as it is a sensual pleasure\nresting upon a pressing want of the individual, the beauty or ugliness of\nthe other individual has nothing to do. Thus the regard for this which is\nyet pursued with such ardour, together with the careful selection which\nsprings from it, is evidently connected, not with the chooser\nhimself—although he imagines it is so—but with the true end, that which is\nto be produced, which is to receive the type of the species as purely and\ncorrectly as possible. Through a thousand physical accidents and moral\naberrations there arise a great variety of deteriorations of the human\nform; yet its true type, in all its parts, is always again established:\nand this takes place under the guidance of the sense of beauty, which\nalways directs the sexual impulse, and without which this sinks to the\nlevel of a disgusting necessity. Accordingly, in the first place, every\none will decidedly prefer and eagerly desire the most beautiful\nindividuals, _i.e._, those in whom the character of the species is most\npurely impressed; but, secondly, each one will specially regard as\nbeautiful in another individual those perfections which he himself lacks,\nnay, even those imperfections which are the opposite of his own. Hence,\nfor example, little men love big women, fair persons like dark, &c. &c.\nThe delusive ecstasy which seizes a man at the sight of a woman whose\nbeauty is suited to him, and pictures to him a union with her as the\nhighest good, is just the _sense of the species_, which, recognising the\ndistinctly expressed stamp of the same, desires to perpetuate it with this\nindividual. Upon this decided inclination to beauty depends the\nmaintenance of the type of the species: hence it acts with such great\npower. We shall examine specially further on the considerations which it\nfollows. Thus what guides man here is really an instinct which is directed\nto doing the best for the species, while the man himself imagines that he\nonly seeks the heightening of his own pleasure. In fact, we have in this\nan instructive lesson concerning the inner nature of all instinct, which,\nas here, almost always sets the individual in motion for the good of the\nspecies. For clearly the pains with which an insect seeks out a particular\nflower, or fruit, or dung, or flesh, or, as in the case of the\nichneumonidæ, the larva of another insect, in order to deposit its eggs\nthere only, and to attain this end shrinks neither from trouble nor\ndanger, is thoroughly analogous to the pains with which for his sexual\nsatisfaction a man carefully chooses a woman with definite qualities which\nappeal to him individually, and strives so eagerly after her that in order\nto attain this end he often sacrifices his own happiness in life, contrary\nto all reason, by a foolish marriage, by love affairs which cost him\nwealth, honour, and life, even by crimes such as adultery or rape, all\nmerely in order to serve the species in the most efficient way, although\nat the cost of the individual, in accordance with the will of nature which\nis everywhere sovereign. Instinct, in fact, is always an act which seems\nto be in accordance with the conception of an end, and yet is entirely\nwithout such a conception. Nature implants it wherever the acting\nindividual is incapable of understanding the end, or would be unwilling to\npursue it. Therefore, as a rule, it is given only to the brutes, and\nindeed especially to the lowest of them which have least understanding;\nbut almost only in the case we are here considering it is also given to\nman, who certainly could understand the end, but would not pursue it with\nthe necessary ardour, that is, even at the expense of his individual\nwelfare. Thus here, as in the case of all instinct, the truth assumes the\nform of an illusion, in order to act upon the will. It is a voluptuous\nillusion which leads the man to believe he will find a greater pleasure in\nthe arms of a woman whose beauty appeals to him than in those of any\nother; or which indeed, exclusively directed to a single individual,\nfirmly convinces him that the possession of her will ensure him excessive\nhappiness. Therefore he imagines he is taking trouble and making\nsacrifices for his own pleasure, while he does so merely for the\nmaintenance of the regular type of the species, or else a quite special\nindividuality, which can only come from these parents, is to attain to\nexistence. The character of instinct is here so perfectly present, thus an\naction which seems to be in accordance with the conception of an end, and\nyet is entirely without such a conception, that he who is drawn by that\nillusion often abhors the end which alone guides it, procreation, and\nwould like to hinder it; thus it is in the case of almost all illicit love\naffairs. In accordance with the character of the matter which has been\nexplained, every lover will experience a marvellous disillusion after the\npleasure he has at last attained, and will wonder that what was so\nlongingly desired accomplishes nothing more than every other sexual\nsatisfaction; so that he does not see himself much benefited by it. That\nwish was related to all his other wishes as the species is related to the\nindividual, thus as the infinite to the finite. The satisfaction, on the\nother hand, is really only for the benefit of the species, and thus does\nnot come within the consciousness of the individual, who, inspired by the\nwill of the species, here served an end with every kind of sacrifice,\nwhich was not his own end at all. Hence, then, every lover, after the\nultimate consummation of the great work, finds himself cheated; for the\nillusion has vanished by means of which the individual was here the dupe\nof the species, Accordingly Plato very happily says: “ἡδονη ἁπαντων\nαλαζονεστατον” (_voluptas ommlum maxime vaniloqua_), _Phileb._ 319.\n\nBut all this reflects light on the instincts and mechanical tendencies of\nthe brutes. They also are, without doubt, involved in a kind of illusion,\nwhich deceives them with the prospect of their own pleasure, while they\nwork so laboriously and with so much self‐denial for the species, the bird\nbuilds its nest, the insect seeks the only suitable place for its eggs, or\neven hunts for prey which, unsuited for its own enjoyment, must be laid\nbeside the eggs as food for the future larvæ, the bees, the wasps, the\nants apply themselves to their skilful dwellings and highly complicated\neconomy. They are all guided with certainty by an illusion, which conceals\nthe service of the species under the mask of an egotistical end. This is\nprobably the only way to comprehend the inner or subjective process that\nlies at the foundation of the manifestations of instinct. Outwardly,\nhowever, or objectively, we find in those creatures which are to a large\nextent governed by instinct, especially in insects, a preponderance of the\nganglion system, _i.e._, the _subjective_ nervous system, over the\nobjective or cerebral system; from which we must conclude that they are\nmoved, not so much by objective, proper apprehension as by subjective\nideas exciting desire, which arise from the influence of the ganglion\nsystem upon the brain, and accordingly by a kind of illusion; and this\nwill be the _physiological_ process in the case of all instinct. For the\nsake of illustration I will mention as another example of instinct in the\nhuman species, although a weak one, the capricious appetite of women who\nare pregnant. It seems to arise from the fact that the nourishment of the\nembryo sometimes requires a special or definite modification of the blood\nwhich flows to it, upon which the food which produces such a modification\nat once presents itself to the pregnant woman as an object of ardent\nlonging, thus here also an illusion arises. Accordingly woman has one\ninstinct more than man; and the ganglion system is also much more\ndeveloped in the woman. That man has fewer instincts than the brutes and\nthat even these few can be easily led astray, may be explained from the\ngreat preponderance of the brain in his case. The sense of beauty which\ninstinctively guides the selection for the satisfaction of sexual passion\nis led astray when it degenerates into the tendency to pederasty;\nanalogous to the fact that the blue‐bottle (_Musca vomitoria_), instead of\ndepositing its eggs, according to instinct, in putrefying flesh, lays them\nin the blossom of the _Arum dracunculus_, deceived by the cadaverous smell\nof this plant.\n\nNow that an instinct entirely directed to that which is to be produced\nlies at the foundation of all sexual love will receive complete\nconfirmation from the fuller analysis of it, which we cannot therefore\navoid. First of all we have to remark here that by nature man is inclined\nto inconstancy in love, woman to constancy. The love of the man sinks\nperceptibly from the moment it has obtained satisfaction; almost every\nother woman charms him more than the one he already possesses; he longs\nfor variety. The love of the woman, on the other hand, increases just from\nthat moment. This is a consequence of the aim of nature which is directed\nto the maintenance, and therefore to the greatest possible increase, of\nthe species. The man can easily beget over a hundred children a year; the\nwoman, on the contrary, with however many men, can yet only bring one\nchild a year into the world (leaving twin births out of account).\nTherefore the man always looks about after other women; the woman, again,\nsticks firmly to the one man; for nature moves her, instinctively and\nwithout reflection, to retain the nourisher and protector of the future\noffspring. Accordingly faithfulness in marriage is with the man\nartificial, with the woman it is natural, and thus adultery on the part of\nthe woman is much less pardonable than on the part of the man, both\nobjectively on account of the consequences and also subjectively on\naccount of its unnaturalness.\n\nBut in order to be thorough and gain full conviction that the pleasure in\nthe other sex, however objective it may seem to us, is yet merely\ndisguised instinct, _i.e._, sense of the species, which strives to\nmaintain its type, we must investigate more fully the considerations which\nguide us in this pleasure, and enter into the details of this, rarely as\nthese details which will have to be mentioned here may have figured in a\nphilosophical work before. These considerations divide themselves into\nthose which directly concern the type of the species, _i.e._, beauty,\nthose which are concerned with physical qualities, and lastly, those which\nare merely relative, which arise from the requisite correction or\nneutralisation of the one‐sided qualities and abnormities of the two\nindividuals by each other. We shall go through them one by one.\n\nThe first consideration which guides our choice and inclination is age. In\ngeneral we accept the age from the years when menstruation begins to those\nwhen it ceases, yet we give the decided preference to the period from the\neighteenth to the twenty‐eighth year. Outside of those years, on the other\nhand, no woman can attract us: an old woman, _i.e._, one who no longer\nmenstruates, excites our aversion. Youth without beauty has still always\nattraction; beauty without youth has none. Clearly the unconscious end\nwhich guides us here is the possibility of reproduction in general:\ntherefore every individual loses attraction for the opposite sex in\nproportion as he or she is removed from the fittest period for begetting\nor conceiving. The second consideration is that of health. Acute diseases\nonly temporarily disturb us, chronic diseases or cachexia repel us,\nbecause they are transmitted to the child. The third consideration is the\nskeleton, because it is the basis of the type of the species. Next to age\nand disease nothing repels us so much as a deformed figure; even the most\nbeautiful face cannot atone for it; on the contrary, even the ugliest face\nwhen accompanied by a straight figure is unquestionably preferred.\nFurther, we feel every disproportion of the skeleton most strongly; for\nexample, a stunted, dumpy, short‐boned figure, and many such; also a\nhalting gait, where it is not the result of an extraneous accident. On the\nother hand, a strikingly beautiful figure can make up for all defects: it\nenchants us. Here also comes in the great value which all attach to the\nsmallness of the feet: it depends upon the fact that they are an essential\ncharacteristic of the species, for no animal has the tarsus and the\nmetatarsus taken together so small as man, which accords with his upright\nwalk; he is a plantigrade. Accordingly Jesus Sirach also says (xxvi. 23,\naccording to the revised translation by Kraus): “A woman with a straight\nfigure and beautiful feet is like columns of gold in sockets of silver.”\nThe teeth also are important; because they are essential for nourishment\nand quite specially hereditary. The fourth consideration is a certain\nfulness of flesh; thus a predominance of the vegetative function, of\nplasticity; because this promises abundant nourishment for the fœtus;\nhence great leanness repels us in a striking degree. A full female bosom\nexerts an exceptional charm upon the male sex; because, standing in direct\nconnection with the female functions of propagation, it promises abundant\nnourishment to the new‐born child. On the other hand, excessively fat\nwomen excite our disgust: the cause is that this indicates atrophy of the\nuterus, thus barrenness; which is not known by the head, but by instinct.\nThe last consideration of all is the beauty of the face. Here also before\neverything else the bones are considered; therefore we look principally\nfor a beautiful nose, and a short turned‐up nose spoils everything. A\nslight inclination of the nose downwards or upwards has decided the\nhappiness in life of innumerable maidens, and rightly so, for it concerns\nthe type of the species. A small mouth, by means of small maxillæ, is very\nessential as specifically characteristic of the human countenance, as\ndistinguished from the muzzle of the brutes. A receding or, as it were,\ncut‐away chin is especially disagreeable, because _mentum prominulum_ is\nan exclusive characteristic of our species. Finally comes the regard for\nbeautiful eyes and forehead; it is connected with the psychical qualities,\nespecially the intellectual which are inherited from the mother.\n\nThe unconscious considerations which, on the other hand, the inclination\nof women follows naturally cannot be so exactly assigned. In general the\nfollowing may be asserted: They give the preference to the age from thirty\nto thirty‐five years, especially over that of youths who yet really\npresent the height of human beauty. The reason is that they are not guided\nby taste but by instinct, which recognises in the age named the acme of\nreproductive power. In general they look less to beauty, especially of the\nface. It is as if they took it upon themselves alone to impart this to the\nchild. They are principally won by the strength of the man, and the\ncourage which is connected with this; for these promise the production of\nstronger children, and also a brave protector for them. Every physical\ndefect of the man, every divergence from the type, may with regard to the\nchild be removed by the woman in reproduction, through the fact that she\nherself is blameless in these respects, or even exceeds in the opposite\ndirection. Only those qualities of the man have to be excepted which are\npeculiar to his sex, and which therefore the mother cannot give to the\nchild: such are the manly structure of the skeleton, broad shoulders,\nslender hips, straight bones, muscular power, courage, beard, &c. Hence it\narises that women often love ugly men, but never an unmanly man, because\nthey cannot neutralise his defects.\n\nThe second class of the considerations which lie at the foundation of\nsexual love are those which regard psychical qualities. Here we shall find\nthat the woman is throughout attracted by the qualities of the heart or\ncharacter in the man, as those which are inherited from the father. The\nwoman is won especially by firmness of will, decision, and courage, and\nperhaps also by honesty and good‐heartedness. On the other hand,\nintellectual gifts exercise no direct and instinctive power over her, just\nbecause they are not inherited from the father. Want of understanding does\na man no harm with women; indeed extraordinary mental endowment, or even\ngenius, might sooner influence them unfavourably as an abnormity. Hence\none often sees an ugly, stupid, and coarse fellow get the better of a\ncultured, able, and amiable man with women. Also marriages from love are\nsometimes consummated between natures which are mentally very different:\nfor example, the man is rough, powerful, and stupid; the woman tenderly\nsensitive, delicately thoughtful, cultured, æsthetic, &c.; or the man is a\ngenius and learned, the woman a goose:\n\n    “_Sic visum Veneri; cui placet impares_\n    _Formas atque animos sub juga aënea_\n          _Sævo mittere cum joco._”\n\nThe reason is, that here quite other considerations than the intellectual\npredominate,—those of instinct. In marriage what is looked to is not\nintellectual entertainment, but the production of children: it is a bond\nof the heart, not of the head. It is a vain and absurd pretence when women\nassert that they have fallen in love with the mind of a man, or else it is\nthe over‐straining of a degenerate nature. Men, on the other hand, are not\ndetermined in their instinctive love by the qualities of character of the\nwoman; hence so many Socrateses have found their Xantippes; for example,\nShakspeare, Albrecht Dürer, Byron, &c. The intellectual qualities,\nhowever, certainly influence here, because they are inherited from the\nmother. Yet their influence is easily outweighed by that of physical\nbeauty, which acts directly, as concerning a more essential point.\nHowever, it happens, either from the feeling or the experience of that\ninfluence, that mothers have their daughters taught the fine arts,\nlanguages, and so forth in order to make them attractive to men, whereby\nthey wish to assist the intellect by artificial means, just as, in case of\nneed, they assist the hips and the bosom. Observe that here we are\nspeaking throughout only of that entirely immediate instinctive attraction\nfrom which alone love properly so called grows. That a woman of culture\nand understanding prizes understanding and intellect in a man, that a man\nfrom rational reflection should test and have regard to the character of\nhis bride, has nothing to do with the matter with which we are dealing\nhere. Such things lie at the bottom of a rational choice in marriage, but\nnot of the passionate love, which is our theme.\n\nHitherto I have only taken account of the _absolute_ considerations,\n_i.e._, those which hold good for every one: I come now to the _relative_\nconsiderations, which are individual, because in their case what is looked\nto is the rectification of the type of the species, which is already\ndefectively presented, the correction of the divergences from it which the\nchooser’s own person already bears in itself, and thus the return to the\npure presentation of the type. Here, then, each one loves what he lacks.\nStarting from the individual constitution, and directed to the individual\nconstitution, the choice which rests upon such relative considerations is\nmuch more definite, decided, and exclusive than that which proceeds merely\nfrom the absolute considerations; therefore the source of really\npassionate love will lie, as a rule, in these relative considerations, and\nonly that of the ordinary and slighter inclination in the absolute\nconsiderations. Accordingly it is not generally precisely correct and\nperfect beauties that kindle great passions. For such a truly passionate\ninclination to arise something is required which can only be expressed by\na chemical metaphor: two persons must neutralise each other, like acid and\nalkali, to a neutral salt. The essential conditions demanded for this are\nthe following. First: all sex is one‐sided. This one‐sidedness is more\ndistinctly expressed in one individual than in another; therefore in every\nindividual it can be better supplemented and neutralised by one than by\nanother individual of the opposite sex, for each one requires a one‐\nsidedness which is the opposite of his own to complete the type of\nhumanity in the new individual that is to be produced, the constitution of\nwhich is always the goal towards which all tends. Physiologists know that\nmanhood and womanhood admit of innumerable degrees, through which the\nformer sinks to the repulsive gynander and hypospadæus, and the latter\nrises to the graceful androgyne; from both sides complete hermaphrodism\ncan be reached, at which point stand those individuals who, holding the\nexact mean between the two sexes, can be attributed to neither, and\nconsequently are unfit to propagate the species. Accordingly, the\nneutralisation of two individualities by each other, of which we are\nspeaking, demands that the definite degree of _his_ manhood shall exactly\ncorrespond to the definite degree of _her_ womanhood; so that the one‐\nsidedness of each exactly annuls that of the other. Accordingly, the most\nmanly man will seek the most womanly woman, and _vice versâ_, and in the\nsame way every individual will seek another corresponding to him or her in\ndegree of sex. Now how far the required relation exists between two\nindividuals is instinctively felt by them, and, together with the other\nrelative considerations, lies at the foundation of the higher degrees of\nlove. While, therefore, the lovers speak pathetically of the harmony of\ntheir souls, the heart of the matter is for the most part the agreement or\nsuitableness pointed out here with reference to the being which is to be\nproduced and its perfection, and which is also clearly of much more\nimportance than the harmony of their souls, which often, not long after\nthe marriage, resolves itself into a howling discord. Now, here come in\nthe further relative considerations, which depend upon the fact that every\none endeavours to neutralise by means of the other his weaknesses,\ndefects, and deviations from the type, so that they will not perpetuate\nthemselves, or even develop into complete abnormities in the child which\nis to be produced. The weaker a man is as regards muscular power the more\nwill he seek for strong women; and the woman on her side will do the same.\nBut since now a less degree of muscular power is natural and regular in\nthe woman, women as a rule will give the preference to strong men.\nFurther, the size is an important consideration. Little men have a decided\ninclination for big women, and _vice versâ_; and indeed in a little man\nthe preference for big women will be so much the more passionate if he\nhimself was begotten by a big father, and only remains little through the\ninfluence of his mother; because he has inherited from his father the\nvascular system and its energy, which was able to supply a large body with\nblood. If, on the other hand, his father and grandfather were both little,\nthat inclination will make itself less felt. At the foundation of the\naversion of a big woman to big men lies the intention of nature to avoid\ntoo big a race, if with the strength which _this_ woman could impart to\nthem they would be too weak to live long. If, however, such a woman\nselects a big husband, perhaps for the sake of being more presentable in\nsociety, then, as a rule, her offspring will have to atone for her folly.\nFurther, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes\nprefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the\nformer. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a\nvariation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or\nat least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity\nof the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of\nScandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the\nwhite colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has\na black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently\na white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that\nthus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of,\nbut every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange\nworld, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires\nin winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became\nwhite. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four\ncenturies ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our\nown.(38) Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair\nand brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has\nbecome a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels\nus. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the\ncorrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more\ndecidedly the more important the part is. Therefore snub‐nosed individuals\nhave an inexpressible liking for hook‐noses, parrot‐faces; and it is the\nsame with regard to all other parts. Men with excessively slim, long\nbodies and limbs can find beauty in a body which is even beyond measure\nstumpy and short. The considerations with regard to temperament act in an\nanalogous manner. Each will prefer the temperament opposed to his own; yet\nonly in proportion as his one is decided. Whoever is himself in some\nrespect very perfect does not indeed seek and love imperfection in this\nrespect, but is yet more easily reconciled to it than others; because he\nhimself insures the children against great imperfection of this part. For\nexample, whoever is himself very white will not object to a yellow\ncomplexion; but whoever has the latter will find dazzling whiteness\ndivinely beautiful. The rare case in which a man falls in love with a\ndecidedly ugly woman occurs when, besides the exact harmony of the degree\nof sex explained above, the whole of her abnormities are precisely the\nopposite, and thus the corrective, of his. The love is then wont to reach\na high degree.\n\nThe profound seriousness with which we consider and ponder each bodily\npart of the woman, and she on her part does the same, the critical\nscrupulosity with which we inspect a woman who begins to please us, the\ncapriciousness of our choice, the keen attention with which the bridegroom\nobserves his betrothed, his carefulness not to be deceived in any part,\nand the great value which he attaches to every excess or defect in the\nessential parts, all this is quite in keeping with the importance of the\nend. For the new being to be produced will have to bear through its whole\nlife a similar part. For example, if the woman is only a little crooked,\nthis may easily impart to her son a hump, and so in all the rest.\nConsciousness of all this certainly does not exist. On the contrary, every\none imagines that he makes that careful selection in the interest of his\nown pleasure (which at bottom cannot be interested in it at all); but he\nmakes it precisely as, under the presupposition of his own corporisation,\nis most in keeping with the interest of the species, to maintain the type\nof which as pure as possible is the secret task. The individual acts here,\nwithout knowing it, by order of something higher than itself, the species;\nhence the importance which it attaches to things which may and indeed must\nbe, indifferent to itself as such. There is something quite peculiar in\nthe profound unconscious seriousness with which two young persons of\nopposite sex who see each other for the first time regard each other, in\nthe searching and penetrating glance they cast at one another, in the\ncareful review which all the features and parts of their respective\npersons have to endure. This investigating and examining is the\n_meditation of the genius of the species_ on the individual which is\npossible through these two and the combination of its qualities. According\nto the result of this meditation is the degree of their pleasure in each\nother and their yearning for each other. This yearning, even after it has\nattained a considerable degree, may be suddenly extinguished again by the\ndiscovery of something that had previously remained unobserved. In this\nway, then, the genius of the species meditates concerning the coming race\nin all who are capable of reproduction. The nature of this race is the\ngreat work with which Cupid is occupied, unceasingly active, speculating,\nand pondering. In comparison with the importance of his great affair,\nwhich concerns the species and all coming races, the affairs of\nindividuals in their whole ephemeral totality are very trifling; therefore\nhe is always ready to sacrifice these regardlessly. For he is related to\nthem as an immortal to mortals, and his interests to theirs as infinite to\nfinite. Thus, in the consciousness of managing affairs of a higher kind\nthan all those which only concern individual weal or woe, he carries them\non sublimely, undisturbed in the midst of the tumult of war, or in the\nbustle of business life, or during the raging of a plague, and pursues\nthem even into the seclusion of the cloister.\n\nWe have seen in the above that the intensity of love increases with its\nindividualisation, because we have shown that the physical qualities of\ntwo individuals can be such that, for the purpose of restoring as far as\npossible the type of the species, the one is quite specially and perfectly\nthe completion or supplement of the other, which therefore desires it\nexclusively. Already in this case a considerable passion arises, which at\nonce gains a nobler and more sublime appearance from the fact that it is\ndirected to an individual object, and to it alone; thus, as it were,\narises at the special order of the species. For the opposite reason, the\nmere sexual impulse is ignoble, because without individualisation it is\ndirected to all, and strives to maintain the species only as regards\nquantity, with little respect to quality. But the individualising, and\nwith it the intensity of the love, can reach so high a degree that without\nits satisfaction all the good things in the world, and even life itself,\nlose their value. It is then a wish which attains a vehemence that no\nother wish ever reaches, and therefore makes one ready for any sacrifice,\nand in case its fulfilment remains unalterably denied, may lead to madness\nor suicide. At the foundation of such an excessive passion there must lie,\nbesides the considerations we have shown above, still others which we have\nnot thus before our eyes. We must therefore assume that here not only the\ncorporisation, but the _will_ of the man and the _intellect_ of the woman\nare specially suitable to each other, in consequence of which a perfectly\ndefinite individual can be produced by them alone, whose existence the\ngenius of the species has here in view, for reasons which are inaccessible\nto us, since they lie in the nature of the thing in itself. Or, to speak\nmore exactly, the will to live desires here to objectify itself in a\nperfectly definite individual, which can only be produced by this father\nwith this mother. This metaphysical desire of the will in itself has\nprimarily no other sphere of action in the series of existences than the\nhearts of the future parents, which accordingly are seized with this\nardent longing, and now imagine themselves to desire on their own account\nwhat really for the present has only a purely metaphysical end, _i.e._, an\nend which lies outside the series of actually existing things. Thus it is\nthe ardent longing to enter existence of the future individual which has\nfirst become possible here, a longing which proceeds from the primary\nsource of all being, and exhibits itself in the phenomenal world as the\nlofty passion of the future parents for each other, paying little regard\nto all that is outside itself; in fact, as an unparalleled illusion, on\naccount of which such a lover would give up all the good things of this\nworld to enjoy the possession of this woman, who yet can really give him\nnothing more than any other. That yet it is just this possession that is\nkept in view here is seen from the fact that even this lofty passion, like\nall others, is extinguished in its enjoyment—to the great astonishment of\nthose who are possessed by it. It also becomes extinct when, through the\nwoman turning out barren (which, according to Hufeland, may arise from\nnineteen accidental constitutional defects), the real metaphysical end is\nfrustrated; just as daily happens in millions of germs trampled under\nfoot, in which yet the same metaphysical life principle strives for\nexistence; for which there is no other consolation than that an infinity\nof space, time, and matter, and consequently inexhaustible opportunity for\nreturn, stands open to the will to live.\n\nThe view which is here expounded must once have been present to the mind\nof Theophrastus Paracelsus, even if only in a fleeting form, though he has\nnot handled this subject, and my whole system of thought was foreign to\nhim; for, in quite a different context and in his desultory manner, he\nwrote the following remarkable words: “_Hi sunt, quos Deus copulavit, ut\neam, quæ fuit Uriæ et David; quamvis ex diametro (sic enim sibi humana\nmens persuadebat) cum justo et legitimo matrimonio pugnaret hoc.... sed\npropter Salomonem_, QUI ALIUNDE NASCI NON POTUIT, _nisi ex Bathseba,\nconjuncto David semine, quamvis meretrice, conjunxit eos Deus_” (_De vita\nlonga_, i. 5).\n\nThe longing of love, the ἱμερος, which the poets of all ages are\nunceasingly occupied with expressing in innumerable forms, and do not\nexhaust the subject, nay, cannot do it justice, this longing, which\nattaches the idea of endless happiness to the possession of a particular\nwoman, and unutterable pain to the thought that this possession cannot be\nattained,—this longing and this pain cannot obtain their material from the\nwants of an ephemeral individual; but they are the sighs of the spirit of\nthe species, which sees here, to be won or lost, a means for the\nattainment of its ends which cannot be replaced, and therefore groans\ndeeply. The species alone has infinite life, and therefore is capable of\ninfinite desires, infinite satisfaction, and infinite pain. But these are\nhere imprisoned in the narrow breast of a mortal. No wonder, then, if such\na breast seems like to burst, and can find no expression for the\nintimations of infinite rapture or infinite misery with which it is\nfilled. This, then, affords the materials for all erotic poetry of a\nsublime kind, which accordingly rises into transcendent metaphors, soaring\nabove all that is earthly. This is the theme of Petrarch, the material for\nthe St. Preuxs, Werthers, and Jacopo Ortis, who apart from it could not be\nunderstood nor explained. For that infinite esteem for the loved one\ncannot rest upon some spiritual excellences, or in general upon any\nobjective, real qualities of hers; for one thing, because she is often not\nsufficiently well known to the lover, as was the case with Petrarch. The\nspirit of the species alone can see at one glance what _worth_ she has for\n_it_, for its ends. And great passions also arise, as a rule, at the first\nglance:\n\n    “Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”\n\n    —SHAKSPEARE, “As You Like it,” iii. 5.\n\nIn this regard a passage in the romance of “_Guzman de Alfarache_,” by\nMateo Aleman, which has been famous for 250 years, is remarkable: “_No es\nnecessario, para que uno ame, que pase distancia de tiempo, que siga\ndiscurso, ni haga eleccion, sino que con aquella primera y sola vista,\nconcurran juntamente cierta correspondencia ó consonancia, ó lo que acá __\nsolemos vulgarmente decir, una confrontacion de sangre, a que por\nparticular influxo suelen mover las estrellas._” (For one to love it is\nnot necessary that much time should pass, that he should set about\nreflecting and make a choice; but only that at that first and only glance\na certain correspondence and consonance should be encountered on both\nsides, or that which in common life we are wont to call a _sympathy of the\nblood_, and to which a special influence of the stars generally impels),\nP. ii. lib. iii. c. 5. Accordingly the loss of the loved one, through a\nrival, or through death, is also for the passionate lover a pain that\nsurpasses all others, just because it is of a transcendental kind, since\nit affects him not merely as an individual, but attacks him in his\n_essentia æterna_, in the life of the species into whose special will and\nservice he was here called. Hence jealousy is such torment and so grim,\nand the surrender of the loved one is the greatest of all sacrifices. A\nhero is ashamed of all lamentations except the lamentation of love,\nbecause in this it is not he but the species that laments. In Calderon’s\n“Zenobia the Great” there is in the first act a scene between Zenobia and\nDecius in which the latter says:\n\n    “_Cielos, luego tu me quieres? Perdiera cien mil victorias,\n    Volviérame_,” &c.\n\n    (Heaven! then thou lovest me? For this I would lose a thousand\n    victories, would turn about, &c.)\n\nHere, honour, which hitherto outweighed every interest, is beaten out of\nthe field as soon as sexual love, _i.e._, the interest of the species,\ncomes into play, and sees before it a decided advantage; for this is\ninfinitely superior to every interest of mere individuals, however\nimportant it may be. Therefore to this alone honour, duty, and fidelity\nyield after they have withstood every other temptation, including the\nthreat of death. In the same way we find in private life that\nconscientiousness is in no point so rare as in this: it is here sometimes\nset aside even by persons who are otherwise honest and just, and adultery\nis recklessly committed when passionate love, _i.e._, the interest of the\nspecies, has mastered them. It even seems as if in this they believed\nthemselves to be conscious of a higher right than the interests of\nindividuals can ever confer; just because they act in the interest of the\nspecies. In this reference Chamfort’s remark is worth noticing: “_Quand un\nhomme et une femme ont l’un pour l’autre une passion violente, il me\nsemble toujours que quelque soient les obstacles qui les séparent, un\nmari, des parens, etc., les deux amans sont l’un a l’autre, de par la\nNature, qu’ils s’appartiennent de droit divin, malgré les lois et les\nconventions humaines_.” Whoever is inclined to be incensed at this should\nbe referred to the remarkable indulgence which the Saviour shows in the\nGospel to the woman taken in adultery, in that He also assumes the same\nguilt in the case of all present. From this point of view the greater part\nof the “Decameron” appears as mere mocking and jeering of the genius of\nthe species at the rights and interests of individuals which it tramples\nunder foot. Differences of rank and all similar circumstances, when they\noppose the union of passionate lovers, are set aside with the same ease\nand treated as nothing by the genius of the species, which, pursuing its\nends that concern innumerable generations, blows off as spray such human\nlaws and scruples. From the same deep‐lying grounds, when the ends of\npassionate love are concerned, every danger is willingly encountered, and\nthose who are otherwise timorous here become courageous. In plays and\nnovels also we see, with ready sympathy, the young persons who are\nfighting the battle of their love, _i.e._, the interest of the species,\ngain the victory over their elders, who are thinking only of the welfare\nof the individuals. For the efforts of the lovers appear to us as much\nmore important, sublime, and therefore right, than anything that can be\nopposed to them, as the species is more important than the individual.\nAccordingly the fundamental theme of almost all comedies is the appearance\nof the genius of the species with its aims, which are opposed to the\npersonal interest of the individuals presented, and therefore threaten to\nundermine their happiness. As a rule it attains its end, which, as in\naccordance with poetical justice, satisfies the spectator, because he\nfeels that the aims of the species are much to be preferred to those of\nthe individual. Therefore at the conclusion he leaves the victorious\nlovers quite confidently, because he shares with them the illusion that\nthey have founded their own happiness, while they have rather sacrificed\nit to the choice of the species, against the will and foresight of their\nelders. It has been attempted in single, abnormal comedies to reverse the\nmatter and bring about the happiness of the individuals at the cost of the\naims of the species; but then the spectator feels the pain which the\ngenius of the species suffers, and is not consoled by the advantages which\nare thereby assured to the individuals. As examples of this kind two very\nwell‐known little pieces occur to me: “_La reine de 16 ans_,” and “_Le\nmarriage de raison_.” In tragedies containing love affairs, since the aims\nof the species are frustrated, the lovers who were its tools, generally\nperish also; for example, in “Romeo and Juliet,” “Tancred,” “Don Carlos,”\n“Wallenstein,” “The Bride of Messina,” and many others.\n\nThe love of a man often affords comical, and sometimes also tragical\nphenomena; both because, taken possession of by the spirit of the species,\nhe is now ruled by this, and no longer belongs to himself: his conduct\nthereby becomes unsuited to the individual. That which in the higher\ngrades of love imparts such a tinge of poetry and sublimeness to his\nthoughts, which gives them even a transcendental and hyperphysical\ntendency, on account of which he seems to lose sight altogether of his\nreal, very physical aim, is at bottom this, that he is now inspired by the\nspirit of the species whose affairs are infinitely more important than all\nthose which concern mere individuals, in order to find under the special\ndirections of this spirit the whole existence of an indefinitely long\nposterity with this individual and exactly determined nature, which it can\nreceive only from him as father and the woman he loves as mother, and\nwhich otherwise could never, _as such_, attain to existence, while the\nobjectification of the will to live expressly demands this existence. It\nis the feeling that he is acting in affairs of such transcendent\nimportance which raises the lover so high above everything earthly, nay,\neven above himself, and gives such a hyperphysical clothing to his very\nphysical desires, that love becomes a poetical episode even in the life of\nthe most prosaic man; in which last case the matter sometimes assumes a\ncomical aspect. That mandate of the will which objectifies itself in the\nspecies exhibits itself in the consciousness of the lover under the mask\nof the anticipation of an infinite blessedness which is to be found for\nhim in the union with this female individual. Now, in the highest grades\nof love this chimera becomes so radiant that if it cannot be attained life\nitself loses all charm, and now appears so joyless, hollow, and\ninsupportable that the disgust at it even overcomes the fear of death, so\nthat it is then sometimes voluntarily cut short. The will of such a man\nhas been caught in the vortex of the will of the species, or this has\nobtained such a great predominance over the individual will that if such a\nman cannot be effective in the first capacity, he disdains to be so in the\nlast. The individual is here too weak a vessel to be capable of enduring\nthe infinite longing of the will of the species concentrated upon a\ndefinite object. In this case, therefore, the issue is suicide, sometimes\nthe double suicide of the two lovers; unless, to save life, nature allows\nmadness to intervene, which then covers with its veil the consciousness of\nthat hopeless state. No year passes without proving the reality of what\nhas been expounded by several cases of all these kinds.\n\nNot only, however, has the unsatisfied passion of love sometimes a tragic\nissue, but the satisfied passion also leads oftener to unhappiness than to\nhappiness. For its demands often conflict so much with the personal\nwelfare of him who is concerned that they undermine it, because they are\nincompatible with his other circumstances, and disturb the plan of life\nbuilt upon them. Nay, not only with external circumstances is love often\nin contradiction, but even with the lover’s own individuality, for it\nflings itself upon persons who, apart from the sexual relation, would be\nhateful, contemptible, and even abhorrent to the lover. But so much more\npowerful is the will of the species than that of the individual that the\nlover shuts his eyes to all those qualities which are repellent to him,\noverlooks all, ignores all, and binds himself for ever to the object of\nhis passion—so entirely is he blinded by that illusion, which vanishes as\nsoon as the will of the species is satisfied, and leaves behind a detested\ncompanion for life. Only from this can it be explained that we often see\nvery reasonable and excellent men bound to termagants and she‐devils, and\ncannot conceive how they could have made such a choice. On this account\nthe ancients represented love as blind. Indeed, a lover may even know\ndistinctly and feel bitterly the faults of temperament and character of\nhis bride, which promise him a miserable life, and yet not be frightened\naway:—\n\n    “I ask not, I care not,\n      If guilt’s in thy heart,\n    I know that I love thee\n      Whatever thou art.”\n\nFor ultimately he seeks not his own things, but those of a third person,\nwho has yet to come into being, although he is involved in the illusion\nthat what he seeks is his own affair. But it is just this not seeking of\none’s own things which is everywhere the stamp of greatness, that gives to\npassionate love also a touch of sublimity, and makes it a worthy subject\nof poetry. Finally, sexual love is compatible even with the extremest\nhatred towards its object: therefore Plato has compared it to the love of\nthe wolf for the sheep. This case appears when a passionate lover, in\nspite of all efforts and entreaties, cannot obtain a favourable hearing on\nany condition:—\n\n    “I love and hate her.”\n\n    —SHAKSPEARE, _Cymb._, iii. 5.\n\nThe hatred of the loved one which then is kindled sometimes goes so far\nthat the lover murders her, and then himself. One or two examples of this\ngenerally happen every year; they will be found in the newspapers.\nTherefore Goethe’s lines are quite correct:—\n\n    “By all despised love! By hellish element!\n    Would that I knew a worse, that I might swear by!”\n\nIt is really no hyperbole if a lover describes the coldness of his beloved\nand the delight of her vanity, which feeds on his sufferings, as cruelty;\nfor he is under the influence of an impulse which, akin to the instinct of\ninsects, compels him, in spite of all grounds of reason, to pursue his end\nunconditionally, and to undervalue everything else: he cannot give it up.\nNot one but many a Petrarch has there been who was compelled to drag\nthrough life the unsatisfied ardour of love, like a fetter, an iron weight\nat his foot, and breathe his sighs in lonely woods; but only in the one\nPetrarch dwelt also the gift of poetry; so that Goethe’s beautiful lines\nhold good of him:—\n\n    “And when in misery the man was dumb\n    A god gave me the power to tell my sorrow.”\n\nIn fact, the genius of the species wages war throughout with the guardian\ngeniuses of individuals, is their pursuer and enemy, always ready\nrelentlessly to destroy personal happiness in order to carry out its ends;\nnay, the welfare of whole nations has sometimes been sacrificed to its\nhumours. An example of this is given us by Shakspeare in “Henry VI.,” pt.\niii., act 3, sc. 2 and 3. All this depends upon the fact that the species,\nas that in which the root of our being lies, has a closer and earlier\nright to us than the individual; hence its affairs take precedence. From\nthe feeling of this the ancients personified the genius of the species in\nCupid, a malevolent, cruel, and therefore ill‐reputed god, in spite of his\nchildish appearance; a capricious, despotic demon, but yet lord of gods\nand men:\n\n    “Συ δ᾽ω θεων τυραννε κ᾽ανθρωπων, Ερως!”\n\n    (_Tu, deorum hominumque tyranne, Amor!_)\n\nA deadly shot, blindness, and wings are his attributes. The latter signify\ninconstancy; and this appears, as a rule, only with the disillusion which\nis the consequence of satisfaction.\n\nBecause the passion depended upon an illusion, which represented that\nwhich has only value for the species as valuable for the individual, the\ndeception must vanish after the attainment of the end of the species. The\nspirit of the species which took possession of the individual sets it free\nagain. Forsaken by this spirit, the individual falls back into its\noriginal limitation and narrowness, and sees with wonder that after such a\nhigh, heroic, and infinite effort nothing has resulted for its pleasure\nbut what every sexual gratification affords. Contrary to expectation, it\nfinds itself no happier than before. It observes that it has been the dupe\nof the will of the species. Therefore, as a rule, a Theseus who has been\nmade happy will forsake his Ariadne. If Petrarch’s passion had been\nsatisfied, his song would have been silenced from that time forth, like\nthat of the bird as soon as the eggs are laid.\n\nHere let me remark in passing that however much my metaphysics of love\nwill displease the very persons who are entangled in this passion, yet if\nrational considerations in general could avail anything against it, the\nfundamental truth disclosed by me would necessarily fit one more than\nanything else to subdue it. But the saying of the old comedian will, no\ndoubt, remain true: “_Quæ res in se __ neque consilium, neque modum habet\nullum, eam consilio regere non potes._”\n\nMarriages from love are made in the interest of the species, not of the\nindividuals. Certainly the persons concerned imagine they are advancing\ntheir own happiness; but their real end is one which is foreign to\nthemselves, for it lies in the production of an individual which is only\npossible through them. Brought together by this aim, they ought henceforth\nto try to get on together as well as possible. But very often the pair\nbrought together by that instinctive illusion, which is the essence of\npassionate love, will, in other respects, be of very different natures.\nThis comes to light when the illusion vanishes, as it necessarily must.\nAccordingly love marriages, as a rule, turn out unhappy; for through them\nthe coming generation is cared for at the expense of the present. “_Quien\nse casa por amores, ha de vivir con dolores_” (Who marries from love must\nlive in sorrow), says the Spanish proverb. The opposite is the case with\nmarriages contracted for purposes of convenience, generally in accordance\nwith the choice of the parents. The considerations prevailing here, of\nwhatever kind they may be, are at least real, and cannot vanish of\nthemselves. Through them, however, the happiness of the present generation\nis certainly cared for, to the disadvantage of the coming generation, and\nnotwithstanding this it remains problematical. The man who in his marriage\nlooks to money more than to the satisfaction of his inclination lives more\nin the individual than in the species; which is directly opposed to the\ntruth; hence it appears unnatural, and excites a certain contempt. A girl\nwho, against the advice of her parents, rejects the offer of a rich and\nnot yet old man, in order, setting aside all considerations of\nconvenience, to choose according to her instinctive inclination alone,\nsacrifices her individual welfare to the species. But just on this account\none cannot withhold from her a certain approbation; for she has preferred\nwhat is of most importance, and has acted in the spirit of nature (more\nexactly, of the species), while the parents advised in the spirit of\nindividual egoism. In accordance with all this, it appears as if in making\na marriage either the individual or the interests of the species must come\noff a loser. And this is generally the case; for that convenience and\npassionate love should go hand in hand is the rarest of lucky accidents.\nThe physical, moral, or intellectual deficiency of the nature of most men\nmay to some extent have its ground in the fact that marriages are\nordinarily entered into not from pure choice and inclination, but from all\nkinds of external considerations, and on account of accidental\ncircumstances. If, however, besides convenience, inclination is also to a\ncertain extent regarded, this is, as it were, an agreement with the genius\nof the species. Happy marriages are well known to be rare; just because it\nlies in the nature of marriage that its chief end is not the present but\nthe coming generation. However, let me add, for the consolation of tender,\nloving natures, that sometimes passionate sexual love associates itself\nwith a feeling of an entirely different origin—real friendship based upon\nagreement of disposition, which yet for the most part only appears when\nsexual love proper is extinguished in its satisfaction. This friendship\nwill then generally spring from the fact that the supplementing and\ncorresponding physical, moral, and intellectual qualities of the two\nindividuals, from which sexual love arose, with reference to the child to\nbe produced, are, with reference also to the individuals themselves,\nrelated to each other in a supplementary manner as opposite qualities of\ntemperament and mental gifts, and thereby form the basis of a harmony of\ndisposition.\n\nThe whole metaphysics of love here dealt with stands in close connection\nwith my metaphysics in general, and the light which it throws upon this\nmay be summed up as follows.\n\nWe have seen that the careful selection for the satisfaction of the sexual\nimpulse, a selection which rises through innumerable degrees up to that of\npassionate love, depends upon the highly serious interest which man takes\nin the special personal constitution of the next generation. Now this\nexceedingly remarkable interest confirms two truths which have been set\nforth in the preceding chapters. (1.) The indestructibility of the true\nnature of man, which lives on in that coming generation. For that interest\nwhich is so lively and eager, and does not spring from reflection and\nintention, but from the inmost characteristics and tendencies of our\nnature, could not be so indelibly present and exercise such great power\nover man if he were absolutely perishable, and were merely followed in\ntime by a race actually and entirely different from him. (2.) That his\ntrue nature lies more in the species than in the individual. For that\ninterest in the special nature of the species, which is the root of all\nlove, from the passing inclination to the serious passion, is for every\none really the highest concern, the success or failure of which touches\nhim most sensibly; therefore it is called _par excellence_ the affair of\nthe heart. Moreover, when this interest has expressed itself strongly and\ndecidedly, everything which merely concerns one’s own person is postponed\nand necessarily sacrificed to it. Through this, then, man shows that the\nspecies lies closer to him than the individual, and he lives more\nimmediately in the former than in the latter. Why does the lover hang with\ncomplete abandonment on the eyes of his chosen one, and is ready to make\nevery sacrifice for her? Because it is his immortal part that longs after\nher; while it is only his mortal part that desires everything else. That\nvehement or intense longing directed to a particular woman is accordingly\nan immediate pledge of the indestructibility of the kernel of our being,\nand of its continued existence in the species. But to regard this\ncontinued existence as something trifling and insufficient is an error\nwhich arises from the fact that under the conception of the continued life\nof the species one thinks nothing more than the future existence of beings\nsimilar to us, but in no regard identical with us; and this again because,\nstarting from knowledge directed towards without, one takes into\nconsideration only the external form of the species as we apprehend it in\nperception, and not its inner nature. But it is just this inner nature\nwhich lies at the foundation of our own consciousness as its kernel, and\nhence indeed is more immediate than this itself, and, as thing in itself,\nfree from the _principium individuationis_, is really the same and\nidentical in all individuals, whether they exist together or after each\nother. Now this is the will to live, thus just that which desires life and\ncontinuance so vehemently. This accordingly is spared and unaffected by\ndeath. It can attain to no better state than its present one; and\nconsequently for it, with life, the constant suffering and striving of the\nindividuals is certain. To free it from this is reserved for the denial of\nthe will to live, as the means by which the individual will breaks away\nfrom the stem of the species, and surrenders that existence in it. We lack\nconceptions for that which it now is; indeed all data for such conceptions\nare wanting. We can only describe it as that which is free to be will to\nlive or not. Buddhism denotes the latter case by the word Nirvana, the\netymology of which was given in the note at the end of chapter 41. It is\nthe point which remains for ever unattainable to all human knowledge, just\nas such.\n\nIf now, from the standpoint of this last consideration, we contemplate the\nturmoil of life, we behold all occupied with its want and misery,\nstraining all their powers to satisfy its infinite needs and to ward off\nits multifarious sorrows, yet without daring to hope anything else than\nsimply the preservation of this tormented existence for a short span of\ntime. In between, however, in the midst of the tumult, we see the glances\nof two lovers meet longingly: yet why so secretly, fearfully, and\nstealthily? Because these lovers are the traitors who seek to perpetuate\nthe whole want and drudgery, which would otherwise speedily reach an end;\nthis they wish to frustrate, as others like them have frustrated it\nbefore. This consideration already passes over into the subject of the\nfollowing chapter.(39)\n\nChapter XLV.(40) On The Assertion Of The Will To Live.\n\nIf the will to live exhibited itself merely as an impulse to self‐\npreservation, this would only be an assertion of the individual phenomenon\nfor the span of time of its natural duration. The cares and troubles of\nsuch a life would not be great, and consequently existence would be easy\nand serene. Since, on the contrary, the will wills life absolutely and for\nall time, it exhibits itself also as sexual impulse, which has in view an\nendless series of generations. This impulse does away with that\ncarelessness, serenity, and innocence which would accompany a merely\nindividual existence, for it brings unrest and melancholy into the\nconsciousness; misfortunes, cares, and misery into the course of life. If,\non the other hand, it is voluntarily suppressed, as we see in rare\nexceptions, then this is the turning of the will, which changes its\ncourse. The will does not then transcend the individual, but is abolished\nin it. Yet this can only take place by means of the individual doing\npainful violence to itself. If, however, it does take place, then the\nfreedom from care and the serenity of the purely individual existence is\nrestored to the consciousness, and indeed in a higher degree. On the other\nhand, to the satisfaction of that most vehement of all impulses and\ndesires is linked the origin of a new existence, thus the carrying out of\nlife anew, with all its burdens, cares, wants, and pains; certainly in\nanother individual; yet if the two who are different in the phenomenon\nwere so absolutely and in themselves, where would then be eternal justice?\nLife presents itself as a problem, a task to be worked out, and therefore,\nas a rule, as a constant conflict with necessity. Accordingly every one\ntries to get through with it and come off as well as he can. He performs\nlife as a compulsory service which he owes. But who has contracted the\ndebt?—His begetter, in the enjoyment of sensual pleasure. Thus, because\nthe one has enjoyed this, the other must live, suffer, and die. However,\nwe know and look back here to the fact that the difference of the similar\nis conditioned by space and time, which in this sense I have called the\n_principium individuationis_. Otherwise eternal justice could not be\nvindicated. Paternal love, on account of which the father is ready to do,\nto suffer, and to risk more for his child than for himself, and at the\nsame time knows that he owes this, depends simply upon the fact that the\nbegetter recognises himself in the begotten.\n\nThe life of a man, with its endless care, want, and suffering, is to be\nregarded as the explanation and paraphrase of the act of procreation,\n_i.e._, the decided assertion of the will to live; and further, it is also\ndue to this that he owes to nature the debt of death, and thinks with\nanxiety of this debt. Is this not evidence of the fact that our existence\ninvolves guilt? At any rate, we always exist, subject to the periodical\npayment of the toll, birth and death, and successively partake of all the\nsorrows and joys of life, so that none can escape us: this is just the\nfruit of the assertion of the will to live. Thus the fear of death, which\nin spite of all the miseries of life holds us firmly to it, is really\nillusory; but just as illusory is the impulse which has enticed us into\nit. This enticement itself may be seen objectively in the reciprocal\nlonging glances of two lovers; they are the purest expression of the will\nto live, in its assertion. How soft and tender it is here! It wills well‐\nbeing, and quiet pleasure, and mild joys for itself, for others, for all.\nIt is the theme of Anacreon. Thus by allurements and flattery it makes its\nway into life. But when once it is there, misery introduces crime, and\ncrime misery; horror and desolation fill the scene. It is the theme of\nÆschylus.\n\nBut now the act through which the will asserts itself and man arises is\none of which all are, in their inmost being, ashamed, which they therefore\ncarefully conceal; nay, if they are caught in it, are terrified as if they\nhad been taken in a crime. It is an action of which in cold reflection one\ngenerally thinks with dislike, and in a lofty mood with loathing.\nReflections which in this regard approach the matter more closely are\noffered by Montaigne in the fifth chapter of the third book, under the\nmarginal heading: “_Ce que c’est que l’amour_.” A peculiar sadness and\nrepentance follows close upon it, is yet most perceptible after the first\nperformance of the act, and in general is the more distinct the nobler is\nthe character. Hence even Pliny, the pagan, says: “_Homini tantum primi\ncoitus pœnitentia, augurium scilicet vitæ, a pœnitenda origine_” (_Hist.\nNat._, x. 83). And, on the other hand, in Goethe’s “Faust,” what do devil\nand witches practise and sing of on their Sabbath? Lewdness and obscenity.\nAnd in the same work (in the admirable “Paralipomena” to “Faust”) what\ndoes incarnate Satan preach before the assembled multitude? Lewdness and\nobscenity. But simply and solely by means of the continual practice of\nsuch an act as this does the human race subsist. If now optimism were\nright, if our existence were to be thankfully recognised as the gift of\nthe highest goodness guided by wisdom, and accordingly in itself\npraiseworthy, commendable, and agreeable, then certainly the act which\nperpetuates it would necessarily have borne quite another physiognomy. If,\non the other hand, this existence is a kind of false step or error; if it\nis the work of an originally blind will, whose most fortunate development\nis that it comes to itself in order to abolish itself; then the act which\nperpetuates that existence must appear precisely as it does appear.\n\nWith reference to the first fundamental truth of my doctrine, the remark\ndeserves a place here that the shame mentioned above which attaches to the\nact of generation extends even to the parts which are concerned in this,\nalthough, like all other parts, they are given us by nature. This is again\na striking proof that not only the actions but even the body of man is to\nbe regarded as the manifestation, the objectification, of his will, and as\nits work. For he could not be ashamed of a thing which existed without his\nwill.\n\nThe act of generation is further related to the world, as the answer is\nrelated to the riddle. The world is wide in space and old in time, and of\nan inexhaustible multiplicity of forms. Yet all this is only the\nmanifestation of the will to live; and the concentration, the focus of\nthis will is the act of generation. Thus in this act the inner nature of\nthe world expresses itself most distinctly. In this regard it is indeed\nworth noticing that this act itself is also distinctly called “the will”\nin the very significant German phrase, “_Er verlangte von ihr, sie sollte\nihm zu Willen sein_” (He desired her to comply with his wishes). As the\nmost distinct expression of the will, then, this act is the kernel, the\ncompendium, the quintessence of the world. Therefore from it we obtain\nlight as to the nature and tendency of the world: it is the answer to the\nriddle. Accordingly it is understood under “the tree of knowledge,” for\nafter acquaintance with it the eyes of every one are opened as to life, as\nByron also says:\n\n    “The tree of knowledge has been plucked,—all’s known.”\n\n    —_Don Juan_, i. 128.\n\nIt is not less in keeping with this quality that it is the great αρρητον,\nthe open secret, which must never and nowhere be distinctly mentioned, but\nalways and everywhere is understood as the principal matter, and is\ntherefore constantly present to the thoughts of all, wherefore also the\nslightest allusion to it is instantly understood. The leading part which\nthat act, and what is connected with it, plays in the world, because love\nintrigues are everywhere, on the one hand, pursued, and, on the other\nhand, assumed, is quite in keeping with the importance of this _punctum\nsaliens_ of the egg of the world. The source of the amusing is simply the\nconstant concealment of the chief concern.\n\nBut see now how the young, innocent, human intellect, when that great\nsecret of the world first becomes known to it, is startled at the\nenormity! The reason of this is that in the long course which the\noriginally unconscious will had to traverse before it rose to intellect,\nespecially to human, rational intellect, it became so strange to itself\nthat it no longer knows its origin, that _pœnitenda origo_, and now, from\nthe standpoint of pure, and therefore innocent, knowing, is horrified at\nit.\n\nSince now the focus of the will, _i.e._, its concentration and highest\nexpression, is the sexual impulse and its satisfaction, this is very\nsignificantly and naïvely expressed in the symbolical language of nature\nthrough the fact that the individualised will, that is, the man and the\nbrute, makes its entrance into the world through the door of the sexual\norgans.\n\nThe assertion of the will to live, which accordingly has its centre in the\nact of generation, is in the case of the brute infallible. For the will,\nwhich is the _natura naturans_, first arrives at reflection in man. To\narrive at reflection means, not merely to know the momentary necessity of\nthe individual will, how to serve it in the pressing present—as is the\ncase with the brute, in proportion to its completeness and its\nnecessities, which go hand in hand—but to have attained a greater breadth\nof knowledge, by virtue of a distinct remembrance of the past, an\napproximate anticipation of the future, and thereby a general survey of\nthe individual life, both one’s own life and that of others, nay, of\nexistence in general. Really the life of every species of brute, through\nthe thousands of years of its existence, is to a certain extent like a\nsingle moment; for it is mere consciousness of the present, without that\nof the past and the future, and consequently without that of death. In\nthis sense it is to be regarded as a permanent moment, a _Nunc stans_.\nHere we see, in passing, most distinctly that in general the form of life,\nor the manifestation of the will with consciousness, is primarily and\nimmediately merely the present. Past and future are added only in the case\nof man, and indeed merely in conception, are known _in abstracto_, and\nperhaps illustrated by pictures of the imagination. Thus after the will to\nlive, _i.e._, the inner being of nature, in the ceaseless striving towards\ncomplete objectification and complete enjoyment, has run through the whole\nseries of the brutes,—which often occurs in the various periods of\nsuccessive animal series each arising anew on the same planet,—it arrives\nat last at reflection in the being who is endowed with reason, man. Here\nnow to him the thing begins to be doubtful, the question forces itself\nupon him whence and wherefore all this is, and chiefly whether the care\nand misery of his life and effort is really repaid by the gain? “_Le jeu\nvaut‐il bien la chandelle?_” Accordingly here is the point at which, in\nthe light of distinct knowledge, he decides for the assertion or denial of\nthe will to live; although as a rule he can only bring the latter to\nconsciousness in a mythical form. We have consequently no ground for\nassuming that a still more highly developed objectification of the will is\never reached, anywhere; for it has already reached its turning‐point here.\n\nChapter XLVI.(41) On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life.\n\nAwakened to life out of the night of unconsciousness, the will finds\nitself an individual, in an endless and boundless world, among innumerable\nindividuals, all striving, suffering, erring; and as if through a troubled\ndream it hurries back to its old unconsciousness. Yet till then its\ndesires are limitless, its claims inexhaustible, and every satisfied\ndesire gives rise to a new one. No possible satisfaction in the world\ncould suffice to still its longings, set a goal to its infinite cravings,\nand fill the bottomless abyss of its heart. Then let one consider what as\na rule are the satisfactions of any kind that a man obtains. For the most\npart nothing more than the bare maintenance of this existence itself,\nextorted day by day with unceasing trouble and constant care in the\nconflict with want, and with death in prospect. Everything in life shows\nthat earthly happiness is destined to be frustrated or recognised as an\nillusion. The grounds of this lie deep in the nature of things.\nAccordingly the life of most men is troubled and short. Those who are\ncomparatively happy are so, for the most part, only apparently, or else,\nlike men of long life, they are the rare exceptions, a possibility of\nwhich there had to be,—as decoy‐birds. Life presents itself as a continual\ndeception in small things as in great. If it has promised, it does not\nkeep its word, unless to show how little worth desiring were the things\ndesired: thus we are deluded now by hope, now by what was hoped for. If it\nhas given, it did so in order to take. The enchantment of distance shows\nus paradises which vanish like optical illusions when we have allowed\nourselves to be mocked by them. Happiness accordingly always lies in the\nfuture, or else in the past, and the present may be compared to a small\ndark cloud which the wind drives over the sunny plain: before and behind\nit all is bright, only it itself always casts a shadow. The present is\ntherefore always insufficient; but the future is uncertain, and the past\nirrevocable. Life with its hourly, daily, weekly, yearly, little, greater,\nand great misfortunes, with its deluded hopes and its accidents destroying\nall our calculations, bears so distinctly the impression of something with\nwhich we must become disgusted, that it is hard to conceive how one has\nbeen able to mistake this and allow oneself to be persuaded that life is\nthere in order to be thankfully enjoyed, and that man exists in order to\nbe happy. Rather that continual illusion and disillusion, and also the\nnature of life throughout, presents itself to us as intended and\ncalculated to awaken the conviction that nothing at all is worth our\nstriving, our efforts and struggles, that all good things are vanity, the\nworld in all its ends bankrupt, and life a business which does not cover\nits expenses;—so that our will may turn away from it.\n\nThe way in which this vanity of all objects of the will makes itself known\nand comprehensible to the intellect which is rooted in the individual, is\nprimarily _time_. It is the form by means of which that vanity of things\nappears as their perishableness; for on account of this all our pleasures\nand joys disappear in our hands, and we afterwards ask astonished where\nthey have remained. That nothingness itself is therefore the only\n_objective_ element in time, _i.e._, that which corresponds to it in the\ninner nature of things, thus that of which it is the expression. Just on\nthis account time is the _a priori_ necessary form of all our perceptions;\nin it everything must present itself, even we ourselves. Accordingly,\nfirst of all, our life is like a payment which one receives in nothing but\ncopper pence, and yet must then give a discharge for: the copper pence are\nthe days; the discharge is death. For at last time makes known the\njudgment of nature concerning the work of all the beings which appear in\nit, in that it destroys them:—\n\n    “And rightly so, for all that arises\n    Is worthy only of being destroyed.\n    Hence were it better that nothing arose.”\n\nThus old age and death, to which every life necessarily hurries on, are\nthe sentence of condemnation on the will to live, coming from the hands of\nnature itself, and which declares that this will is an effort which\nfrustrates itself. “What thou hast wished,” it says, “ends thus: desire\nsomething better.” Hence the instruction which his life affords to every\none consists, as a whole, in this, that the objects of his desires\ncontinually delude, waver, and fall, and accordingly bring more misery\nthan joy, till at last the whole foundation upon which they all stand\ngives way, in that his life itself is destroyed and so he receives the\nlast proof that all his striving and wishing was a perversity, a false\npath:—\n\n    “Then old age and experience, hand in hand,\n    Lead him to death, and make him understand,\n    After a search so painful and so long,\n    That all his life he has been in the wrong.”\n\nWe shall, however, enter into the details of the matter, for it is in\nthese views that I have met with most contradiction. First of all, I have\nto confirm by the following remarks the proof given in the text of the\nnegative nature of all satisfaction, thus of all pleasure and all\nhappiness, in opposition to the positive nature of pain.\n\nWe feel pain, but not painlessness; we feel care, but not the absence of\ncare; fear, but not security. We feel the wish as we feel hunger and\nthirst; but as soon as it has been fulfilled, it is like the mouthful that\nhas been taken, which ceases to exist for our feeling the moment it is\nswallowed. Pleasures and joys we miss painfully whenever they are wanting;\nbut pains, even when they cease after having long been present, are not\ndirectly missed, but at the most are intentionally thought of by means of\nreflection. For only pain and want can be felt positively, and therefore\nannounce themselves; well‐being, on the other hand, is merely negative.\nTherefore we do not become conscious of the three greatest blessings of\nlife, health, youth, and freedom, so long as we possess them, but only\nafter we have lost them; for they also are negations. We only observe that\ndays of our life were happy after they have given place to unhappy ones.\nIn proportion as pleasures increase, the susceptibility for them\ndecreases: what is customary is no longer felt as a pleasure. Just in this\nway, however, is the susceptibility for suffering increased, for the loss\nof what we are accustomed to is painfully felt. Thus the measure of what\nis necessary increases through possession, and thereby the capacity for\nfeeling pain. The hours pass the quicker the more agreeably they are\nspent, and the slower the more painfully they are spent; because pain, not\npleasure, is the positive, the presence of which makes itself felt. In the\nsame way we become conscious of time when we are bored, not when we are\ndiverted. Both these cases prove that our existence is most happy when we\nperceive it least, from which it follows that it would be better not to\nhave it. Great and lively joy can only be conceived as the consequence of\ngreat misery, which has preceded it; for nothing can be added to a state\nof permanent satisfaction but some amusement, or the satisfaction of\nvanity. Hence all poets are obliged to bring their heroes into anxious and\npainful situations, so that they may be able to free them from them.\nDramas and Epics accordingly always describe only fighting, suffering,\ntormented men; and every romance is a rareeshow in which we observe the\nspasms and convulsions of the agonised human heart. Walter Scott has\nnaïvely expressed this æsthetic necessity in the conclusion to his novel,\n“Old Mortality.” Voltaire, who was so highly favoured both by nature and\nfortune, says, in entire agreement with the truth proved by me: “_Le\nbonheur n’est qu’un rève, et la douleur est réelle_.” And he adds: “_Il y\na quatre‐vingts ans que je l’éprouve. Je n’y sais autre chose que me\nrésigner, et me dire que les mouches sont nées pour être mangées par les\naraignées, et les hommes pour être dévorés par les chagrins._”\n\nBefore so confidently affirming that life is a blessing worth desiring or\ngiving thanks for, let one compare calmly the sum of the possible\npleasures which a man can enjoy in his life with the sum of the possible\nsorrows which may come to him in his life. I believe the balance will not\nbe hard to strike. At bottom, however, it is quite superfluous to dispute\nwhether there is more good or evil in the world: for the mere existence of\nevil decides the matter. For the evil can never be annulled, and\nconsequently can never be balanced by the good which may exist along with\nit or after it.\n\n    “_Mille piacer’ non vagliono un tormento._”—Petr.\n    (A thousand pleasures are not worth one torment.)\n\nFor that a thousand had lived in happiness and pleasure would never do\naway with the anguish and death‐agony of a single one; and just as little\ndoes my present well‐being undo my past suffering. If, therefore, the\nevils in the world were a hundred times less than is the case, yet their\nmere existence would be sufficient to establish a truth which may be\nexpressed in different ways, though always somewhat indirectly, the truth\nthat we have not to rejoice but rather to mourn at the existence of the\nworld;—that its non‐existence would be preferable to its existence;—that\nit is something which at bottom ought not to be, &c., &c. Very beautiful\nis Byron’s expression of this truth:—\n\n    “_Our life is a false nature_,—’tis not in\n    The harmony of things, this hard decree,\n    This uneradicable taint of sin,\n    This boundless Upas, this all‐blasting tree\n    Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be\n    The skies, which rain their plagues on men like dew—\n    Disease, death, bondage—all the woes we see—\n    And worse, the woes we see not—which throb through\n    The immedicable soul, with heart‐aches ever new.”\n\nIf the world and life were an end in themselves, and accordingly required\ntheoretically no justification and practically no indemnification or\ncompensation, but existed, for instance, as Spinoza and the Spinozists of\nthe present day represent it, as the single manifestation of a God, who,\n_animi causa_, or else in order to mirror himself, undertook such an\nevolution of himself; and hence its existence neither required to be\njustified by reasons nor redeemed by results;—then the sufferings and\nmiseries of life would not indeed have to be fully equalled by the\npleasures and well‐being in it; for this, as has been said, is impossible,\nbecause my present pain is never abolished by future joys, for the latter\nfill their time as the former fills its time: but there would have to be\nabsolutely no suffering, and death also would either have not to be, or\nelse to have no terrors for us. Only thus would life pay for itself.\n\nBut since now our state is rather something which had better not be,\neverything about us bears the trace of this,—just as in hell everything\nsmells of sulphur—for everything is always imperfect and illusory,\neverything agreeable is displaced by something disagreeable, every\nenjoyment is only a half one, every pleasure introduces its own\ndisturbance, every relief new difficulties, every aid of our daily and\nhourly need leaves us each moment in the lurch and denies its service, the\nstep upon which we place our foot so often gives way under us, nay,\nmisfortunes great and small are the element of our life; and, in a word,\nwe are like Phineus, whose food was all tainted and made uneatable by the\nharpies.(42) Two remedies for this are tried: first, ευλαβεια, _i.e._,\nprudence, foresight, cunning; it does not fully instruct us, is\ninsufficient, and leads to defeat. Secondly, the stoical equanimity which\nseeks to arm us against all misfortunes by preparedness for everything and\ncontempt of all: practically it becomes cynical renunciation, which\nprefers once for all to reject all means of relief and all alleviations—it\nreduces us to the position of dogs, like Diogenes in his tub. The truth\nis, we ought to be wretched, and we are so. The chief source of the\nserious evils which affect men is man himself: _homo homini lupus_.\nWhoever keeps this last fact clearly in view beholds the world as a hell,\nwhich surpasses that of Dante in this respect, that one man must be the\ndevil of another. For this, one is certainly more fitted than another; an\narch‐fiend, indeed, more fitted than all others, appearing in the form of\na conqueror, who places several hundred thousand men opposite each other,\nand says to them: “To suffer and die is your destiny; now shoot each other\nwith guns and cannons,” and they do so.\n\nIn general, however, the conduct of men towards each other is\ncharacterised as a rule by injustice, extreme unfairness, hardness, nay,\ncruelty: an opposite course of conduct appears only as an exception. Upon\nthis depends the necessity of the State and legislation, and upon none of\nyour false pretences. But in all cases which do not lie within the reach\nof the law, that regardlessness of his like, peculiar to man, shows itself\nat once; a regardlessness which springs from his boundless egoism, and\nsometimes also from wickedness. How man deals with man is shown, for\nexample, by negro slavery, the final end of which is sugar and coffee. But\nwe do not need to go so far: at the age of five years to enter a cotton‐\nspinning or other factory, and from that time forth to sit there daily,\nfirst ten, then twelve, and ultimately fourteen hours, performing the same\nmechanical labour, is to purchase dearly the satisfaction of drawing\nbreath. But this is the fate of millions, and that of millions more is\nanalogous to it.\n\nWe others, however, can be made perfectly miserable by trifling\nmisfortunes; perfectly happy, not by the world. Whatever one may say, the\nhappiest moment of the happy man is the moment of his falling asleep, and\nthe unhappiest moment of the unhappy that of his awaking. An indirect but\ncertain proof of the fact that men feel themselves unhappy, and\nconsequently are so, is also abundantly afforded by the fearful envy which\ndwells in us all, and which in all relations of life, on the occasion of\nany superiority, of whatever kind it may be, is excited, and cannot\ncontain its poison. Because they feel themselves unhappy, men cannot\nendure the sight of one whom they imagine happy; he who for the moment\nfeels himself happy would like to make all around him happy also, and\nsays:\n\n    “_Que tout le monde ici soit heureux de ma joie._”\n\nIf life were in itself a blessing to be prized, and decidedly to be\npreferred to non‐existence, the exit from it would not need to be guarded\nby such fearful sentinels as death and its terrors. But who would continue\nin life as it is if death were less terrible? And again, who could even\nendure the thought of death if life were a pleasure! But thus the former\nhas still always this good, that it is the end of life, and we console\nourselves with regard to the suffering of life with death, and with regard\nto death with the suffering of life. The truth is, that the two\ninseparably belong to each other, for together they constitute a deviation\nfrom the right path, to return to which is as difficult as it is\ndesirable.\n\nIf the world were not something which, expressed _practically_, ought not\nto be, it would also not be _theoretically_ a problem; but its existence\nwould either require no explanation, inasmuch as it would be so entirely\nself‐evident that wonder concerning it or a question about it could arise\nin no mind, or its end would present itself unmistakably. Instead of this,\nhowever, it is indeed an insoluble problem; for even the most perfect\nphilosophy will yet always contain an unexplained element, like an\ninsoluble deposit or the remainder which the irrational relation of two\nquantities always leaves over. Therefore if one ventures to raise the\nquestion why there is not rather nothing than this world, the world cannot\nbe justified from itself, no ground, no final cause of its existence can\nbe found in itself, it cannot be shown that it exists for its own sake,\n_i.e._, for its own advantage. In accordance with my teaching, this can\ncertainly be explained from the fact that the principle of its existence\nis expressly one which is without ground, a blind will to live, which as\nthing in itself cannot be made subject to the principle of sufficient\nreason, which is merely the form of the phenomenon, and through which\nalone every why is justified. But this also agrees with the nature of the\nworld, for only a blind will, no seeing will, could place itself in the\nposition in which we behold ourselves. A seeing will would rather have\nsoon made the calculation that the business did not cover the cost, for\nsuch a mighty effort and struggle with the straining of all the powers,\nunder constant care, anxiety, and want, and with the inevitable\ndestruction of every individual life, finds no compensation in the\nephemeral existence itself, which is so obtained, and which passes into\nnothing in our hands. Hence, then, the explanation of the world from the\nAnaxagorean νους, _i.e._, from a will accompanied by _knowledge_,\nnecessarily demands optimism to excuse it, which accordingly is set up and\nmaintained in spite of the loudly crying evidence of a whole world full of\nmisery. Life is there given out to be a gift, while it is evident that\nevery one would have declined such a gift if he could have seen it and\ntested it beforehand; just as Lessing admired the understanding of his\nson, who, because he had absolutely declined to enter life, had to be\nforcibly brought into it with the forceps, but was scarcely there when he\nhurried away from it again. On the other hand, it is then well said that\nlife should be, from one end to the other, only a lesson; to which,\nhowever, any one might reply: “For this very reason I wish I had been left\nin the peace of the all‐sufficient nothing, where I would have had no need\nof lessons or of anything else.” If indeed it should now be added that he\nmust one day give an account of every hour of his life, he would be more\njustified in himself demanding an account of why he had been transferred\nfrom that rest into such a questionable, dark, anxious, and painful\nsituation. To this, then, we are led by false views. For human existence,\nfar from bearing the character of a _gift_, has entirely the character of\na _debt_ that has been contracted. The calling in of this debt appears in\nthe form of the pressing wants, tormenting desires, and endless misery\nestablished through this existence. As a rule, the whole lifetime is\ndevoted to the paying off of this debt; but this only meets the interest.\nThe payment of the capital takes place through death. And when was this\ndebt contracted? At the begetting.\n\nAccordingly, if we regard man as a being whose existence is a punishment\nand an expiation, we then view him in a right light. The myth of the fall\n(although probably, like the whole of Judaism, borrowed from the Zend‐\nAvesta: Bundahish, 15), is the only point in the Old Testament to which I\ncan ascribe metaphysical, although only allegorical, truth; indeed it is\nthis alone that reconciles me to the Old Testament. Our existence\nresembles nothing so much as the consequence of a false step and a guilty\ndesire. New Testament Christianity, the ethical spirit of which is that of\nBrahmanism and Buddhism, and is therefore very foreign to the otherwise\noptimistic spirit of the Old Testament, has also, very wisely, linked\nitself on precisely to that myth: indeed, without this it would have found\nno point of connection with Judaism at all. If any one desires to measure\nthe degree of guilt with which our existence is tainted, then let him look\nat the suffering that is connected with it. Every great pain, whether\nbodily or mental, declares what we deserve: for it could not come to us if\nwe did not deserve it. That Christianity also regards our existence in\nthis light is shown by a passage in Luther’s Commentary on Galatians,\nchap. 3, which I only have beside me in Latin: “_Sumus autem nos omnes\ncorporibus et rebus subjecti Diabolo, et hospites sumus in mundo, cujus\nipse princeps et Deus est. Ideo panis, quem edimus, potus, quem bibimus,\nvestes, quibus utimur, imo aër et totum quo vivimus in carne, sub ipsius\nimperio est._” An outcry has been made about the melancholy and\ndisconsolate nature of my philosophy; yet it lies merely in the fact that\ninstead of inventing a future hell as the equivalent of sin, I show that\nwhere guilt lies in the world there is also already something akin to\nhell; but whoever is inclined to deny this can easily experience it.\n\nAnd to this world, to this scene of tormented and agonised beings, who\nonly continue to exist by devouring each other, in which, therefore, every\nravenous beast is the living grave of thousands of others, and its self‐\nmaintenance is a chain of painful deaths; and in which the capacity for\nfeeling pain increases with knowledge, and therefore reaches its highest\ndegree in man, a degree which is the higher the more intelligent the man\nis; to this world it has been sought to apply the system of optimism, and\ndemonstrate to us that it is the best of all possible worlds. The\nabsurdity is glaring. But an optimist bids me open my eyes and look at the\nworld, how beautiful it is in the sunshine, with its mountains and\nvalleys, streams, plants, animals, &c. &c. Is the world, then, a\nrareeshow? These things are certainly beautiful to _look at_, but to _be_\nthem is something quite different. Then comes a teleologist, and praises\nto me the wise arrangement by virtue of which it is taken care that the\nplanets do not run their heads together, that land and sea do not get\nmixed into a pulp, but are held so beautifully apart, also that everything\nis neither rigid with continual frost nor roasted with heat; in the same\nway, that in consequence of the obliquity of the ecliptic there is no\neternal spring, in which nothing could attain to ripeness, &c. &c. But\nthis and all like it are mere _conditiones sine quibus non_. If in general\nthere is to be a world at all, if its planets are to exist at least as\nlong as the light of a distant fixed star requires to reach them, and are\nnot, like Lessing’s son, to depart again immediately after birth, then\ncertainly it must not be so clumsily constructed that its very framework\nthreatens to fall to pieces. But if one goes on to the results of this\napplauded work, considers the players who act upon the stage which is so\ndurably constructed, and now sees how with sensibility pain appears, and\nincreases in proportion as the sensibility develops to intelligence, and\nthen how, keeping pace with this, desire and suffering come out ever more\nstrongly, and increase till at last human life affords no other material\nthan this for tragedies and comedies, then whoever is honest will scarcely\nbe disposed to set up hallelujahs. David Hume, in his “Natural History of\nReligion,” §§ 6, 7, 8, and 13, has also exposed, mercilessly but with\nconvincing truth, the real though concealed source of these last. He also\nexplains clearly in the tenth and eleventh books of his “Dialogues on\nNatural Religion,” with very pertinent arguments, which are yet of quite a\ndifferent kind from mine, the miserable nature of this world and the\nuntenableness of all optimism; in doing which he attacks this in its\norigin. Both works of Hume’s are as well worth reading as they are unknown\nat the present day in Germany, where, on the other hand, incredible\npleasure is found, patriotically, in the most disgusting nonsense of home‐\nbred boastful mediocrities, who are proclaimed great men. Hamann, however,\ntranslated these dialogues; Kant went through the translation, and late in\nlife wished to induce Hamann’s son to publish them because the translation\nof Platner did not satisfy him (see Kant’s biography by F. W. Schubert,\npp. 81 and 165). From every page of David Hume there is more to be learned\nthan from the collected philosophical works of Hegel, Herbart, and\nSchleiermacher together.\n\nThe founder of systematic optimism, again, is Leibnitz whose philosophical\nmerit I have no intention of denying although I have never succeeded in\nthinking myself into the monadology, pre‐established harmony, and\n_identitas indiscernibilium_. His “_Nouveaux essays sur l’entendement_”\nare, however, merely an excerpt, with a full yet weak criticism, with a\nview to correction, of Locke’s work which is justly of world‐wide\nreputation. He here opposes Locke with just as little success as he\nopposes Newton in the “_Tentamen de motuum cœlestium causis_,” directed\nagainst the system of gravitation. The “Critique of Pure Reason” is\nspecially directed against this Leibnitz‐Wolfian philosophy, and has a\npolemical, nay, a destructive relation to it, just as it is related to\nLocke and Hume as a continuation and further construction. That at the\npresent day the professors of philosophy are on all sides engaged in\nsetting Leibnitz, with his juggling, upon his legs again, nay, in\nglorifying him, and, on the other hand, in depreciating and setting aside\nKant as much as possible, has its sufficient reason in the _primum\nvivere_; the “Critique of Pure Reason” does not admit of one giving out\nJudaistic mythology as philosophy, nor of one speaking, without ceremony,\nof the “soul” as a given reality, a well‐known and well‐accredited person,\nwithout giving account of how one arrived at this conception, and what\njustification one has for using it scientifically. But _primum vivere,\ndeinde philosophari_! Down with Kant, _vivat_ our Leibnitz! To return,\nthen, to Leibnitz, I cannot ascribe to the Théodicée, as a methodical and\nbroad unfolding of optimism, any other merit than this, that it gave\noccasion later for the immortal “_Candide_” of the great Voltaire; whereby\ncertainly Leibnitz’s often‐repeated and lame excuse for the evil of the\nworld, that the bad sometimes brings about the good, received a\nconfirmation which was unexpected by him. Even by the name of his hero\nVoltaire indicates that it only requires sincerity to recognise the\nopposite of optimism. Really upon this scene of sin, suffering, and death\noptimism makes such an extraordinary figure that one would be forced to\nregard it as irony if one had not a sufficient explanation of its origin\nin the secret source of it (insincere flattery, with insulting confidence\nin its success), which, as was mentioned above, is so delightfully\ndisclosed by Hume.\n\nBut indeed to the palpably sophistical proofs of Leibnitz that this is the\nbest of all possible worlds, we may seriously and honestly oppose the\nproof that it is the worst of all possible worlds. For possible means, not\nwhat one may construct in imagination, but what can actually exist and\ncontinue. Now this world is so arranged as to be able to maintain itself\nwith great difficulty; but if it were a little worse, it could no longer\nmaintain itself. Consequently a worse world, since it could not continue\nto exist, is absolutely impossible: thus this world itself is the worst of\nall possible worlds. For not only if the planets were to run their heads\ntogether, but even if any one of the actually appearing perturbations of\ntheir course, instead of being gradually balanced by others, continued to\nincrease, the world would soon reach its end. Astronomers know upon what\naccidental circumstances—principally the irrational relation to each other\nof the periods of revolution—this depends, and have carefully calculated\nthat it will always go on well; consequently the world also can continue\nand go on. We will hope that, although Newton was of an opposite opinion,\nthey have not miscalculated, and consequently that the mechanical\nperpetual motion realised in such a planetary system will not also, like\nthe rest, ultimately come to a standstill. Again, under the firm crust of\nthe planet dwell the powerful forces of nature which, as soon as some\naccident affords them free play, must necessarily destroy that crust, with\neverything living upon it, as has already taken place at least three times\nupon our planet, and will probably take place oftener still. The\nearthquake of Lisbon, the earthquake of Haiti, the destruction of Pompeii,\nare only small, playful hints of what is possible. A small alteration of\nthe atmosphere, which cannot even be chemically proved, causes cholera,\nyellow fever, black death, &c., which carry off millions of men; a\nsomewhat greater alteration would extinguish all life. A very moderate\nincrease of heat would dry up all the rivers and springs. The brutes have\nreceived just barely so much in the way of organs and powers as enables\nthem to procure with the greatest exertion sustenance for their own lives\nand food for their offspring; therefore if a brute loses a limb, or even\nthe full use of one, it must generally perish. Even of the human race,\npowerful as are the weapons it possesses in understanding and reason,\nnine‐tenths live in constant conflict with want, always balancing\nthemselves with difficulty and effort upon the brink of destruction. Thus\nthroughout, as for the continuance of the whole, so also for that of each\nindividual being the conditions are barely and scantily given, but nothing\nover. The individual life is a ceaseless battle for existence itself;\nwhile at every step destruction threatens it. Just because this threat is\nso often fulfilled provision had to be made, by means of the enormous\nexcess of the germs, that the destruction of the individuals should not\ninvolve that of the species, for which alone nature really cares. The\nworld is therefore as bad as it possibly can be if it is to continue to be\nat all. _Q. E. D._ The fossils of the entirely different kinds of animal\nspecies which formerly inhabited the planet afford us, as a proof of our\ncalculation, the records of worlds the continuance of which was no longer\npossible, and which consequently were somewhat worse than the worst of\npossible worlds.\n\nOptimism is at bottom the unmerited self‐praise of the real originator of\nthe world, the will to live, which views itself complacently in its works;\nand accordingly it is not only a false, but also a pernicious doctrine.\nFor it presents life to us as a desirable condition, and the happiness of\nman as the end of it. Starting from this, every one then believes that he\nhas the most just claim to happiness and pleasure; and if, as is wont to\nhappen, these do not fall to his lot, then he believes that he is wronged,\nnay, that he loses the end of his existence; while it is far more correct\nto regard work, privation, misery, and suffering, crowned by death, as the\nend of our life (as Brahmanism and Buddhism, and also genuine Christianity\ndo); for it is these which lead to the denial of the will to live. In the\nNew Testament the world is represented as a valley of tears, life as a\nprocess of purifying or refining, and the symbol of Christianity is an\ninstrument of torture. Therefore, when Leibnitz, Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke,\nand Pope brought forward optimism, the general offence which it gave\ndepended principally upon the fact that optimism is irreconcilable with\nChristianity; as Voltaire states and explains in the \n\nAs in “_Candide_” Voltaire wages war in his facetious manner against\noptimism, Byron has also done so in his serious and tragic style, in his\nimmortal masterpiece, “Cain,” on account of which he also has been\nhonoured with the invectives of the obscurantist, Friedrich Schlegel. If\nnow, in conclusion, to confirm my view, I were to give what has been said\nby great men of all ages in this anti‐optimistic spirit, there would be no\nend to the quotations, for almost every one of them has expressed in\nstrong language his knowledge of the misery of this world. Thus, not to\nconfirm, but merely to embellish this chapter, a few quotations of this\nkind may be given at the end of it.\n\nFirst of all, let me mention here that the Greeks, far as they were from\nthe Christian and lofty Asiatic conception of the world, and although they\ndecidedly stood at the point of view of the assertion of the will, were\nyet deeply affected by the wretchedness of existence. This is shown even\nby the invention of tragedy, which belongs to them. Another proof of it is\nafforded us by the custom of the Thracians, which is first mentioned by\nHerodotus, though often referred to afterwards—the custom of welcoming the\nnew‐born child with lamentations, and recounting all the evils which now\nlie before it; and, on the other hand, burying the dead with mirth and\njesting, because they are no longer exposed to so many and great\nsufferings. In a beautiful poem preserved for us by Plutarch (_De audiend.\npoët. in fine_) this runs thus:—\n\n    “Τον φυντα θρηνειν, εις ὁσ᾽ ερχεται κακα\n    Τον δ᾽αυ θανοντα και πονων πεπαυμενον\n    Χαιροντας ευφημουντας εκπεμπειν δομων.”\n\n    (_Lugere genitum, tanta qui intrarit mala:_\n    _At morte si quis finiisset miserias,_\n    _Hunc laude amicos atque lætitia exsequi._)\n\nIt is not to be attributed to historical relationship, but to the moral\nidentity of the matter, that the Mexicans welcomed the new‐born child with\nthe words, “My child, thou art born to endure; therefore endure, suffer,\nand keep silence.” And, following the same feeling, Swift (as Walter Scott\nrelates in his Life of Swift) early adopted the custom of keeping his\nbirthday not as a time of joy but of sadness, and of reading on that day\nthe passage of the Bible in which Job laments and curses the day on which\nit was said in the house of his father a man‐child is born.\n\nWell known and too long for quotation is the passage in the “Apology of\nSocrates,” in which Plato makes this wisest of mortals say that death,\neven if it deprives us of consciousness for ever, would be a wonderful\ngain, for a deep, dreamless sleep every day is to be preferred even to the\nhappiest life.\n\nA saying of Heraclitus runs: “Τῳ ουν βιῳ ονομα μεν βιος, εργον δε\nθανατος.” (_Vitæ nomen quidem est vita, opus autem mors. Etymologicum\nmagnum, voce_ Βιος; also _Eustath. ad Iliad._, i. p. 31.)\n\nThe beautiful lines of the “Theogony” are famous:—\n\n    “Αρχην μεν μη φυναι επιχθονιοισιν αριστον,\n    Μηδ᾽ εισιδειν αυγας οξεος ἡελιου;\n      Φυντα δ᾽ ὁπως ωκιστα πυλας Αϊδαο περησαι,\n      Και κεισθαι πολλην γην επαμησαμενον.”\n\n    (_Optima sors homini natum non esse, nec unquam._\n    _Adspexisse diem, flammiferumque jubar._\n    _Altera jam genitum demitti protinus Orco,_\n    _Et pressum multa mergere corpus humo._)\n\nSophocles, in “Œdipus Colonus” (1225), has the following abbreviation of\nthe same:—\n\n    “Μη φυναι τον ἁπαντα νικα\n    λογον; το δ᾽ επει φανῃ,\n    βηναι κειθεν, ὁθεν περ ἡκει,\n    πολυ δευτερον, ὡς ταχιστα.”\n\n    (_Natum non esse sortes vincit alias omnes: proxima autem est, ubi\n    quis in lucem editus fuerit, eodem redire, unde venit, quam\n    ocissime._)\n\nEuripides says:—\n\n    “Πας δ᾽οδυνηρος βιος ανθρωπων,\n    Κ᾽ουκ εστι πονων αναπαυσις.”\n\n    (_Omnis hominum vita est plena dolore,_\n    _Nec datur laborum remissio._)\n\n    —HIPPOL, 189.\n\nAnd Homer already said:—\n\n    “Ου μεν γαρ τι εστιν οϊζυρωτερον ανδρος\n    Παντων, ὁσσα δε γαιαν επι πνεει τε και ἑρπει.”\n\n    (_Non enim quidquam alicubi est calamitosius homine_\n    _Omnium, quotquot super terram spirantque et moventur._)\n\n    —II. xvii. 446.\n\nEven Pliny says: “_Quapropter hoc primum quisque in remediis animi sui\nhabeat, ex omnibus bonis, quæ homini natura tribuit, nullum melius esse\ntempestiva morte_” (_Hist. Nat._ 28, 2).\n\nShakspeare puts the words in the mouth of the old king Henry IV.:—\n\n    “O heaven! that one might read the book of fate,\n    And see the revolution of the times,\n    ... how chances mock,\n    And changes fill the cup of alteration\n    With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,\n    The happiest youth,—viewing his progress through,\n    What perils past, what crosses to ensue,—\n    Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.”\n\nFinally, Byron:—\n\n    “Count o’er the joys thine hours have seen,\n      Count o’er thy days from anguish free,\n    And know, whatever thou hast been,\n      ’Tis something better not to be.”\n\nBaltazar Gracian also brings the misery of our existence before our eyes\nin the darkest colours in the “Criticon,” Parte i., Crisi 5, just at the\nbeginning, and Crisi 7 at the end, where he explicitly represents life as\na tragic farce.\n\nYet no one has so thoroughly and exhaustively handled this subject as, in\nour own day, Leopardi. He is entirely filled and penetrated by it: his\ntheme is everywhere the mockery and wretchedness of this existence; he\npresents it upon every page of his works, yet in such a multiplicity of\nforms and applications, with such wealth of imagery that he never wearies\nus, but, on the contrary, is throughout entertaining and exciting.\n\nChapter XLVII.(43) On Ethics.\n\nHere is the great gap which occurs in these supplements, on account of the\ncircumstance that I have already dealt with moral philosophy in the\nnarrower sense in the two prize essays published under the title, “_Die\nGrundprobleme der Ethik_,” an acquaintance with which is assumed, as I\nhave said, in order to avoid useless repetition. Therefore there only\nremains for me here a small gleaning of isolated reflections which could\nnot be discussed in that work, the \n\nThat moral investigations are incomparably more difficult than physical,\nand in general than any others, results from the fact that they are almost\nimmediately concerned with the thing in itself, namely, with that\nmanifestation of it in which, directly discovered by the light of\nknowledge, it reveals its nature as _will_. Physical truths, on the other\nhand, remain entirely in the province of the idea, _i.e._, of the\nphenomenon, and merely show how the lowest manifestations of the will\npresent themselves in the idea in conformity to law. Further, the\nconsideration of the world from the _physical_ side, however far and\nsuccessfully it may be pursued, is in its results without any consolation\nfor us: on the _moral_ side alone is consolation to be found; for here the\ndepths of our own inner nature disclose themselves to the consideration.\n\nBut my philosophy is the only one which confers upon ethics its complete\nand whole rights; for only if the true nature of man is his own _will_,\nand consequently he is, in the strictest sense, his own work, are his\ndeeds really entirely his and to be ascribed to him. On the other hand,\nwhenever he has another origin, or is the work of a being different from\nhimself, all his guilt falls back upon this origin, or originator. For\n_operari sequitur esse_.\n\nTo connect the force which produces the phenomenon of the world, and\nconsequently determines its nature, with the morality of the disposition\nor character, and thus to establish a _moral_ order of the world as the\nfoundation of the _physical_,—this has been since Socrates the problem of\nphilosophy. Theism solved it in a childish manner, which could not satisfy\nmature humanity. Therefore pantheism opposed itself to it whenever it\nventured to do so, and showed that nature bears in itself the power by\nvirtue of which it appears. With this, however, ethics had necessarily to\nbe given up. Spinoza, indeed, attempts here and there to preserve it by\nmeans of sophistry, but for the most part gives it up altogether, and,\nwith a boldness which excites astonishment and repugnance, explains the\ndistinction between right and wrong, and in general between good and evil,\nas merely conventional, thus in itself empty (for example, _Eth._ iv.,\nprop. 37, schol. 2). After having met with unmerited neglect for more than\na hundred years, Spinoza has, in general, become too much esteemed in this\ncentury through the reaction caused by the swing of the pendulum of\nopinion. All pantheism must ultimately be overthrown by the inevitable\ndemands of ethics, and then by the evil and suffering of the world. If the\nworld is a theophany, then all that man, or even the brute, does is\nequally divine and excellent; nothing can be censurable, and nothing more\npraiseworthy than the rest: thus there is no ethics. Hence, in consequence\nof the revived Spinozism of our own day, thus of pantheism, the treatment\nof ethics has sunk so low and become so shallow that it has been made a\nmere instruction as to the proper life of a citizen and a member of a\nfamily, in which the ultimate end of human existence is supposed to\nconsist: thus in methodical, complete, smug, and comfortable philistinism.\nPantheism, indeed, has only led to such shallow vulgarisms through the\nfact that (by a shameful misuse of the _e quovis ligno fit Mercurius_) a\ncommon mind, Hegel, has, by the well‐known means, been falsely stamped as\na great philosopher, and a herd of his disciples, at first suborned,\nafterwards only stupid, received his weighty words. Such outrages on the\nhuman mind do not remain unpunished: the seed has sprouted. In the same\nspirit it was then asserted that ethics should have for its material not\nthe conduct of individuals, but that of nations, that this alone was a\ntheme worthy of it. Nothing can be more perverse than this view, which\nrests on the most vulgar realism. For in every individual appears the\nwhole undivided will to live, the thing in itself, and the microcosm is\nlike the macrocosm. The masses have no more content than each individual.\nEthics is concerned not with actions and their results, but with willing,\nand willing itself takes place only in the individual. Not the fate of\nnations, which exists only in the phenomenon, but that of the individual\nis decided _morally_. Nations are really mere abstractions; individuals\nalone actually exist. Thus, then, is pantheism related to ethics. But the\nevil and misery of the world are not in accord even with theism; hence it\nsought assistance from all kinds of evasions, theodicies, which yet were\nirretrievably overthrown by the arguments of Hume and Voltaire. Pantheism,\nhowever, is completely untenable in the presence of that bad side of the\nworld. Only when the world is regarded entirely from without and from the\n_physical_ side alone, and nothing else is kept in view but the constant\nrestorative order, and the comparative imperishableness of the whole which\nis thereby introduced, is it perhaps possible to explain it as a god, yet\nalways only symbolically. But if one enters within, thus considers also\nthe _subjective_ and _moral_ side, with its preponderance of want,\nsuffering, and misery, of dissension, wickedness, madness, and perversity,\nthen one soon becomes conscious with horror that the last thing imaginable\none has before one is a theophany. I, however, have shown, and especially\nin my work “_Ueber den Willen in der Natur_” have proved, that the force\nwhich works and acts in nature is identical with the will in us. Thereby\nthe moral order of the world is brought into direct connection with the\nforce which produces the phenomenon of the world. For the phenomenon of\nthe will must exactly correspond to its nature. Upon this depends the\nexposition of eternal justice given in §§ 63 and 64 of the first volume,\nand the world, although subsisting by its own power, receives throughout a\n_moral_ tendency. Accordingly the problem which has been discussed from\nthe time of Socrates is now for the first time really solved, and the\ndemand of thinking reason directed to morality is satisfied. Yet I have\nnever professed to propound a philosophy which leaves no questions\nunanswered. In this sense philosophy is really impossible: it would be the\nscience of omniscience. But _est quadam prodire tenus, si non datur\nultra_: there is a limit to which reflection can penetrate and can so far\nlighten the night of our existence, although the horizon always remains\ndark. My doctrine reaches this limit in the will to live, which in its own\nmanifestation asserts or denies itself. To wish, however, to go beyond\nthis is, in my eyes, like wishing to fly beyond the atmosphere. We must\nstop there; even although new problems arise out of those which have been\nsolved. Besides this, however, we must refer to the fact that the validity\nof the principle of sufficient reason is limited to the phenomenon; this\nwas the theme of my first essay on that principle, which was published as\nearly as 1813.\n\nI now go on to supplement particular points, and shall begin by\nsupporting, with two passages from classical poetry, my explanation of\nweeping given in § 67 of the first volume, that it springs from sympathy\nthe object of which is one’s own self. At the end of the eighth book of\nthe “Odyssey,” Ulysses, who in all his many sorrows is never represented\nas weeping, bursts into tears, when, still unknown, he hears his early\nheroic life and deeds sung by the bard Demodocus in the palace of the\nPhæacian king, for this remembrance of the brilliant period of his life\ncontrasts with his present wretchedness. Thus not this itself directly,\nbut the objective consideration of it, the picture of his present summoned\nup by his past, calls forth his tears; he feels sympathy with himself.\nEuripides makes the innocently condemned Hypolytus, bemoaning his own\nfate, express the same feeling:\n\n    “Φευ ειθ᾽ ην εμαυτον προσβλεπειν εναντιον\n    στανθ᾽, ὡς εδακρυς᾽, ὁια πασχομεν κακα” (1084).\n\n    (_Heu, si liceret mihi, me ipsum extrinsecus spectare, quantopere\n    deflerem mala, quæ patior._)\n\nFinally, as a proof of my explanation, an anecdote may be given here which\nI take from the English journal _The Herald_ of the 16th July 1836. A\nclient, when he had heard his case set forth by his counsel in court,\nburst into a flood of tears, and cried, “I never knew I had suffered half\nso much till I heard it here to‐day.”\n\nI have shown in § 55 of the first volume how, notwithstanding the\nunalterable nature of the character, _i.e._, of the special fundamental\nwill of a man, a real moral repentance is yet possible. I wish, however,\nto add the following explanation, which I must \n\nMoral repentance is now conditioned by the fact that before the act the\ninclination to it did not leave the intellect free scope, because it did\nnot allow it to contemplate clearly and fully the counter‐motives, but\nrather turned it ever anew to the motives in its own favour. But now,\nafter the act has been performed, these motives are, by this itself,\nneutralised, and consequently have become ineffective. Now reality brings\nbefore the intellect the counter‐motives as the consequences of the act\nwhich have already appeared; and the intellect now knows that they would\nhave been the stronger if it had only adequately contemplated and weighed\nthem. Thus the man becomes conscious that he has done what was really not\nin accordance with his will. This knowledge is repentance, for he has not\nacted with full intellectual freedom; for all the motives did not attain\nto efficiency. What excluded the motives opposed to the action was in the\ncase of the hasty action the emotion, and in the case of the deliberate\naction the passion. It has also often depended upon the circumstance that\nhis reason certainly presented to him the counter‐motives in the abstract,\nbut was not supported by a sufficiently strong imagination to present to\nhim their whole content and true significance in images. Examples of what\nhas been said are the cases in which revenge, jealousy, or avarice have\nled to murder. After it is committed they are extinguished, and now\njustice, sympathy, the remembrance of former friendship, raise their\nvoices and say all that they would have said before if they had been\nallowed to speak. Then enters the bitter repentance, which says, “If it\nwere not done it would never happen.” An incomparable representation of\nthis is afforded by the old Scottish ballad, which has also been\ntranslated by Herder, “Edward, Edward.” In an analogous manner, the\nneglect of one’s own good may occasion an egotistical repentance. For\nexample, when an otherwise unadvisable marriage is concluded in\nconsequence of passionate love, which now is extinguished just by the\nmarriage, and for the first time the counter‐motives of personal interest,\nlost independence, &c., &c., come into consciousness, and speak as they\nwould have spoken before if they had been allowed utterance. All such\nactions accordingly spring from a relative weakness of intellect, because\nit lets itself be mastered by the will, just where its function as the\npresenter of motives ought to have been inexorably fulfilled, without\nallowing itself to be disturbed by the will. The vehemence of the will is\nhere only _indirectly_ the cause, in that it interferes with the\nintellect, and thereby prepares for itself repentance. The\n_reasonableness_ of the character σωφροσυνη, which is opposed to\npassionateness, really consists in this, that the will never overpowers\nthe intellect to such an extent as to prevent it from correctly exercising\nits function of the distinct, full, and clear exposition of the motives in\nthe abstract for the reason, in the concrete for the imagination. Now this\nmay just as well depend upon the moderation and mildness of the will as\nupon the strength of the intellect. All that is required is that the\nlatter should be _relatively_ strong enough for the will that is present,\nthus that the two should stand in a suitable relation to each other.\n\nThe following explanations have still to be added to the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the philosophy of law expounded in § 62 of the first\nvolume, and also in my prize essay on the foundation of morals,",

    "page_content": "Those who, with Spinoza, deny that there is a right apart from the State,\nconfound the means for enforcing the right with the right itself.\nCertainly the right is insured protection only in the State. But it itself\nexists independently of the State. For by force it can only be suppressed,\nnever abolished. Accordingly the State is nothing more than an institution\nfor protection, which has become necessary through the manifold attacks to\nwhich man is exposed, and which he would not be able to ward off alone,\nbut only in union with others. So, then, the aims of the State are—\n\n(1.) First of all, outward protection, which may just as well become\nneedful against lifeless forces of nature or wild beasts as against men,\nconsequently against other nations; although this case is the most\nfrequent and important, for the worst enemy of man is man: _homo homini\nlupus_. Since, in consequence of this aim, nations always set up the\nprinciple, in words if not with deeds, that they wish to stand to each\nother in a purely defensive, never in an aggressive relation, they\nrecognise _the law of nations_. This is at bottom nothing but natural law,\nin the only sphere of its practical activity that remains to it, between\nnation and nation, where it alone must reign, because its stronger son,\npositive law, cannot assert itself, since it requires a judge and an\nexecutive. Accordingly the law of nations consists of a certain degree of\nmorality in the dealings of nations with each other, the maintenance of\nwhich is a question of honour for mankind. The bar at which cases based on\nthis law are tried is that of public opinion.\n\n(2.) Protection within, thus protection of the members of a State against\neach other, consequently security of private right, by means of the\nmaintenance of an honest state of things, which consists in this, that the\nconcentrated forces of all protect each individual, from which arises an\nappearance as if all were honest, _i.e._, just, thus as if no one wished\nto injure the others.\n\nBut, as is always the way in human affairs, the removal of one evil\ngenerally opens the way for a new one; thus the granting of that double\nprotection introduces the need of a third, namely: (3.) Protection against\nthe protector, _i.e._, against him or those to whom the society has\ntransferred the management of the protection, thus the guarantee of public\nright. This appears most completely attainable by dividing and separating\nfrom each other the threefold unity of the protective power, thus the\nlegislature, the judicature, and the executive, so that each is managed by\nothers, and independently of the rest. The great value, indeed the\nfundamental idea of the monarchy appears to me to lie in the fact that\nbecause men remain men one must be placed so high, and so much power,\nwealth, security, and absolute inviolability given him that there remains\nnothing for him to desire, to hope, and to fear for himself; whereby the\negoism which dwells in him, as in every one, is annihilated, as it were,\nby neutralisation, and he is now able, as if he were no longer a man, to\npractise justice, and to keep in view no longer his own but only the\npublic good. This is the source of the seemingly superhuman nature that\neverywhere accompanies royalty, and distinguishes it so infinitely from\nthe mere presidency. Therefore it must also be hereditary, not elective;\npartly in order that no one may see his equal in the king; partly that the\nking himself may only be able to provide for his successors by caring for\nthe welfare of the State, which is absolutely one with that of his family.\n\nIf other ends besides that of protection, here explained, are ascribed to\nthe State, this may easily endanger the true end.\n\nAccording to my explanation, the right of property arises only through the\nexpenditure of labour upon things. This truth, which has already often\nbeen expressed, finds a noteworthy confirmation in the fact that it is\nasserted, even in a practical regard, in a declaration of the American ex‐\npresident, Quincey Adams, which is to be found in the _Quarterly Review_\nof 1840, No. 130; and also in French, in the “_Bibliothèque universelle de\nGenêve_,” July 1840, No. 55. I will give it here in German (English of\n_Quarterly Review_): “There are moralists who have questioned the right of\nthe Europeans to intrude upon the possessions of the aboriginals in any\ncase, and under any limitations whatsoever; but have they maturely\nconsidered the whole subject? The Indian right of possession itself\nstands, with regard to the greatest part of the country, upon a\n_questionable_ foundation. Their cultivated fields, their constructed\nhabitations, a space of ample sufficiency for their subsistence, and\nwhatever they had annexed of themselves by personal labour, was\nundoubtedly by the laws of nature theirs. But what is the right of a\nhuntsman to the forest of a thousand miles over which he has accidentally\nranged in quest of prey?” &c. In the same way, those who in our own day\nhave seen occasion to combat communism with reasons (for example, the\nArchbishop of Paris, in his pastoral of June 1851) have always brought\nforward the argument that property is the result of work, as it were only\nembodied work. This is further evidence that the right of property can\nonly be established by the application of work to things, for only in this\nrespect does it find free recognition and make itself morally valid.\n\nAn entirely different kind of proof of the same truth is afforded by the\nmoral fact that while the law punishes poaching just as severely as theft,\nand in many countries more severely, yet civil honour, which is\nirrevocably lost by the latter, is really not affected by the former; but\nthe poacher, if he has been guilty of nothing else, is certainly tainted\nwith a fault, but yet is not regarded, like the thief, as dishonourable\nand shunned by all. For the principles of civil honour rest upon moral and\nnot upon mere positive law; but game is not an object upon which labour is\nbestowed, and thus also is not an object of a morally valid possession:\nthe right to it is therefore entirely a positive one, and is not morally\nrecognised.\n\nAccording to my view, the principle ought to lie at the basis of criminal\nlaw that it is not really the man but only the deed which is punished, in\norder that it may not recur. The criminal is merely the subject in whom\nthe deed is punished, in order that the law in consequence of which the\npunishment is inflicted may retain its deterrent power. This is the\nmeaning of the expression, “He is forfeited to the law.” According to\nKant’s explanation, which amounts to a _jus talionis_, it is not the deed\nbut the man that is punished. The penitentiary system also seeks not so\nmuch to punish the deed as the man, in order to reform him. It thereby\nsets aside the real aim of punishment, determent from the deed, in order\nto attain the very problematic end of reformation. But it is always a\ndoubtful thing to attempt to attain two different ends by _one_ means: how\nmuch more so if the two are in any sense opposite ends. Education is a\nbenefit, punishment ought to be an evil; the penitentiary prison is\nsupposed to accomplish both at once. Moreover, however large a share\nuntutored ignorance, combined with outward distress, may have in many\ncrimes, yet we dare not regard these as their principal cause, for\ninnumerable persons living in the same ignorance and under absolutely\nsimilar circumstances commit no crimes. Thus the substance of the matter\nfalls back upon the personal, moral character; but this, as I have shown\nin my prize essay on the freedom of the will, is absolutely unalterable.\nTherefore moral reformation is really not possible, but only determent\nfrom the deed through fear. At the same time, the correction of knowledge\nand the awakening of the desire to work can certainly be attained; it will\nappear what effect this can produce. Besides this, it appears to me, from\nthe aim of punishment set forth in the text, that, when possible, the\napparent severity of the punishment should exceed the actual: but solitary\nconfinement achieves the reverse. Its great severity has no witnesses, and\nis by no means anticipated by any one who has not experienced it; thus it\ndoes not deter. It threatens him who is tempted to crime by want and\nmisery with the opposite pole of human suffering, ennui: but, as Goethe\nrightly observes—\n\n    “When real affliction is our lot,\n    Then do we long for ennui.”\n\nThe contemplation of it will deter him just as little as the sight of the\npalatial prisons which are built by honest men for rogues. If, however, it\nis desired that these penitentiary prisons should be regarded as\neducational institutions, then it is to be regretted that the entrance to\nthem is only obtained by crimes, instead of which it ought to have\npreceded them.\n\nThat punishment, as Beccaria has taught, ought to bear a proper proportion\nto the crime does not depend upon the fact that it would be an expiation\nof it, but rather on the fact that the pledge ought to be proportionate to\nthe value of that for which it answers. Therefore every one is justified\nin demanding the pledge of the life of another as a guarantee for the\nsecurity of his own life, but not for the security of his property, for\nwhich the freedom, and so forth, of another is sufficient pledge. For the\nsecurity of the life of the citizens capital punishment is therefore\nabsolutely necessary. Those who wish to abolish it should be answered,\n“First remove murder from the world, and then capital punishment ought to\nfollow.” It ought also to be inflicted for the clear attempt to murder\njust as for murder itself; for the law desires to punish the deed, not to\nrevenge its consequences. In general the injury to be guarded against\naffords the right measure for the punishment which is to be threatened,\nbut it does not give the moral baseness of the forbidden action. Therefore\nthe law may rightly impose the punishment of imprisonment for allowing a\nflower‐pot to fall from a window, or impose hard labour for smoking in the\nwoods during the summer, and yet permit it in the winter. But to impose\nthe punishment of death, as in Poland, for shooting an ure‐ox is too much,\nfor the maintenance of the species of ure‐oxen may not be purchased with\nhuman life. In determining the measure of the punishment, along with the\nmagnitude of the injury to be guarded against, we have to consider the\nstrength of the motives which impel to the forbidden action. Quite a\ndifferent standard of punishment would be established if expiation,\nretribution, _jus talionis_, were its true ground. But the criminal code\nought to be nothing but a register of counter‐motives for possible\ncriminal actions: therefore each of these motives must decidedly outweigh\nthe motives which lead to these actions, and indeed so much the more the\ngreater the evil is which would arise from the action to be guarded\nagainst, the stronger the temptation to it, and the more difficult the\nconviction of the criminal;—always under the correct assumption that the\nwill is not free, but determinable by motives;—apart from this it could\nnot be got at at all. So much for the philosophy of law.\n\nIn my prize essay on the freedom of the will (p. 50 _seq._) I have proved\nthe originality and unalterableness of the inborn character, from which\nthe moral content of the course of life proceeds. It is established as a\nfact. But in order to understand problems in their full extent it is\nsometimes necessary to oppose opposites sharply to each other. In this\ncase, then, let one recall how incredibly great is the inborn difference\nbetween man and man, in a moral and in an intellectual regard. Here\nnobleness and wisdom; there wickedness and stupidity. In one the goodness\nof the heart shines out of the eyes, or the stamp of genius is enthroned\nin his countenance. The base physiognomy of another is the impression of\nmoral worthlessness and intellectual dulness, imprinted by the hands of\nnature itself, unmistakable and ineradicable; he looks as if he must be\nashamed of existence. But to this outward appearance the inner being\nreally corresponds. We cannot possibly assume that such differences, which\ntransform the whole being of the man, and which nothing can abolish,\nwhich, further, in conflict with his circumstances, determine his course\nof life, could exist without guilt or merit on the part of those affected\nby them, and be merely the work of chance. Even from this it is evident\nthat the man must be in a certain sense his own work. But now, on the\nother hand, we can show the source of these differences empirically in the\nnature of the parents; and besides this, the meeting and connection of\nthese parents has clearly been the work of the most accidental\ncircumstances. By such considerations, then, we are forcibly directed to\nthe distinction between the phenomenon and the true being of things, which\nalone can contain the solution of that problem. The thing in itself only\nreveals itself by means of the forms of the phenomenon; therefore what\nproceeds from the thing in itself must yet appear in those forms, thus\nalso in the bonds of causality. Accordingly it will present itself to us\nhere as a mysterious and incomprehensible guidance of things, of which the\nexternal empirical connection would be the mere tool. Yet all that happens\nappears in this empirical connection introduced by causes, thus\nnecessarily and determined from without, while its true ground lies in the\ninner nature of what thus manifests itself. Certainly we can here see the\nsolution of the problem only from afar, and when we reflect upon it we\nfall into an abyss of thought—as Hamlet very truly says, “thoughts beyond\nthe reaches of our souls.” In my essay in the first volume of the Parerga\n“On the Appearance of Intention in the Fate of Individuals” I have set\nforth my thoughts upon this mysterious guidance of things, a guidance\nwhich indeed can only be conceived symbolically.\n\nIn § 14 of my prize essay on the foundation of morals there will be found\nan exposition of egoism, as regards its nature; and the following attempt\nto discover its root may be looked upon as supplementary to that\nparagraph. Nature itself contradicts itself directly, according as it\nspeaks from the individual or the universal, from within or from without,\nfrom the centre or the periphery. It has its centre in every individual;\nfor each individual is the whole will to live. Therefore, even if this\nindividual is only an insect or a worm, nature itself speaks out of it\nthus: “I alone am all in all: in my maintenance everything is involved;\nthe rest may perish, it is really nothing.” So speaks nature from the\n_particular_ standpoint, thus from the point of view of self‐\nconsciousness, and upon this depends the egoism of every living thing. On\nthe other hand, from the _universal_ point of view,—which is that of the\n_consciousness of other things_, that of objective knowledge, which for\nthe moment looks away from the individual with whom the knowledge is\nconnected,—from without then, from the periphery nature speaks thus: “The\nindividual is nothing, and less than nothing. I destroy millions of\nindividuals every day, for sport and pastime: I abandon their fate to the\nmost capricious and wilful of my children, chance, who harasses them at\npleasure. I produce millions of new individuals every day, without any\ndiminution of my productive power; just as little as the power of a mirror\nis exhausted by the number of reflections of the sun, which it casts on\nthe wall one after another. The individual is nothing.” Only he who knows\nhow to really reconcile and eliminate this patent contradiction of nature\nhas a true answer to the question as to the perishableness and\nimperishableness of his own self. I believe I have given, in the first\nfour chapters of this fourth book of the supplements, an adequate\nintroduction to such knowledge. What is said above may further be\nillustrated in the following manner. Every individual, when he looks\nwithin, recognises in his nature, which is his will, the thing in itself,\ntherefore that which everywhere alone is real. Accordingly he conceives\nhimself as the kernel and centre of the world, and regards himself as of\ninfinite importance. If, on the other hand, he looks without, then he is\nin the province of the idea the mere phenomenon, where he sees himself as\nan individual among an infinite number of other individuals, accordingly\nas something very insignificant, nay, vanishing altogether. Consequently\nevery individual, even the most insignificant, every I, when regarded from\nwithin, is all in all; regarded from without, on the other hand, he is\nnothing, or at least as good as nothing. Hence upon this depends the great\ndifference between what each one necessarily is in his own eyes and what\nhe is in the eyes of others, consequently the egoism with which every one\nreproaches every one else.\n\nIn consequence of this egoism our fundamental error of all is this, that\nwith reference to each other we are reciprocally not I. On the other hand,\nto be just, noble, and benevolent is nothing else than to translate my\nmetaphysics into actions. To say that time and space are mere forms of our\nknowledge, not conditions of things in themselves, is the same as to say\nthat the doctrine of metempsychosis, “Thou shalt one day be born as him\nwhom thou now injurest, and in thy turn shalt suffer like injury,” is\nidentical with the formula of the Brahmans, which has frequently been\nmentioned, _Tat twam asi_, “This thou art.” All true virtue proceeds from\nthe immediate and intuitive knowledge of the metaphysical identity of all\nbeings, which I have frequently shown, especially in § 22 of my prize\nessay on the foundation of morals. But just on this account it is not the\nresult of a special pre‐eminence of intellect; on the contrary, even the\nweakest intellect is sufficient to see through the _principium\nindividuationis_, which is what is required in this matter. Accordingly we\nmay find the most excellent character even in the case of a very weak\nunderstanding. And further, the excitement of our sympathy is accompanied\nby no exertion of our intellect. It rather appears that the requisite\npenetration of the _principium individuationis_ would be present in every\none if it were not that the _will_ opposes this, and by virtue of its\nimmediate mysterious and despotic influence upon the intellect generally\nprevents it from arising; so that ultimately all guilt falls back upon the\n_will_, as indeed is in conformity with the fact.\n\nThe doctrine of metempsychosis, touched on above, deviates from the truth\nmerely through the circumstance that it transfers to the future what\nalready is now. It makes my true inner nature exist in others only after\nmy death, while, according to the truth, it already lives in them now, and\ndeath merely removes the illusion on account of which I am not aware of\nthis; just as an innumerable host of stars constantly shine above our\nheads, but only become visible to us when the one sun near the earth has\nset. From this point of view my individual existence, however much, like\nthat sun, it may outshine everything, appears ultimately only as a\nhindrance which stands between me and the knowledge of the true extent of\nmy being. And because every individual, in his knowledge, is subject to\nthis hindrance, it is just individuation that keeps the will to live in\nerror as to its own nature; it is the Mâyâ of Brahmanism. Death is a\nrefutation of this error, and abolishes it. I believe that at the moment\nof death we become conscious that it is a mere illusion that has limited\nour existence to our person. Indeed empirical traces of this may be found\nin several states which are related to death by the abolition of the\nconcentration of consciousness in the brain, among which the magnetic\nsleep is the most prominent; for in it, if it reaches a high degree, our\nexistence shows itself through various symptoms, beyond our persons and in\nother beings, most strikingly by direct participation in the thoughts of\nanother individual, and ultimately even by the power of knowing the\nabsent, the distant, and even the future, thus by a kind of omnipresence.\n\nUpon this metaphysical identity of the will, as the thing in itself, in\nthe infinite multiplicity of its phenomena, three principal phenomena\ndepend, which may be included under the common name of sympathies: (1)\n_sympathy proper_, which, as I have shown, is the basis of justice and\nbenevolence, _caritas_; (2) _sexual love_, with capricious selection,\n_amor_, which is the life of the species, that asserts its precedence over\nthat of the individual; (3) _magic_, to which animal magnetism and\nsympathetic cures also belong. Accordingly _sympathy_ may be defined as\nthe empirical appearance of the metaphysical identity of the will, through\nthe physical multiplicity of its phenomena, whereby a connection shows\nitself which is entirely different from that brought about by means of the\nforms of the phenomenon which we comprehend under the principle of\nsufficient reason.\n\nChapter XLVIII.(44) On The Doctrine Of The Denial Of The Will To Live.\n\nMan has his existence and being either _with_ his will, _i.e._, his\nconsent, or _without_ this; in the latter case an existence so embittered\nby manifold and insupportable sufferings would be a flagrant injustice.\nThe ancients, especially the Stoics, also the Peripatetics and Academics,\nstrove in vain to prove that virtue sufficed to make life happy.\nExperience cried out loudly against it. What really lay at the foundation\nof the efforts of these philosophers, although they were not distinctly\nconscious of it, was the assumed _justice_ of the thing; whoever was\nwithout guilt ought to be free from suffering, thus happy. But the serious\nand profound solution of the problem lies in the Christian doctrine that\nworks do not justify. Accordingly a man, even if he has practised all\njustice and benevolence, consequently the αγαθον, _honestum_, is yet not,\nas Cicero imagines, _culpa omni carens_ (_Tusc._, v. i.); but _el delito\nmayor del hombre es haber nacido_ (the greatest guilt of man is that he\nwas born), as Calderon, illuminated by Christianity, has expressed it with\nfar profounder knowledge than these wise men. Therefore that man comes\ninto the world already tainted with guilt can appear absurd only to him\nwho regards him as just then having arisen out of nothing and as the work\nof another. In consequence of _this_ guilt, then, which must therefore\nhave proceeded from his will, man remains rightly exposed to physical and\nmental suffering, even if he has practised all those virtues, thus is not\nhappy. This follows from the _eternal justice_ of which I have spoken in §\n63 of the first volume. That, however, as St. Paul (Rom. iii. 21),\nAugustine, and Luther teach, works cannot justify, inasmuch as we all are\nand remain essentially sinners, ultimately rests upon the fact that,\nbecause _operari sequitur esse_, if we acted as we ought, we would\nnecessarily be as we ought. But then we would require no _salvation_ from\nour present condition, which not only Christianity but also Brahmanism and\nBuddhism (under the name which is expressed in English by _final\nemancipation_) present as the highest goal, _i.e._, we would not need to\nbecome something quite different from, nay, the very opposite of what we\nare. Since, however, we are what we ought not to be, we also necessarily\ndo what we ought not to do. Therefore we need a complete transformation of\nour mind and nature; _i.e._, the new birth, as the result of which\nsalvation appears. Although the guilt lies in action, _operari_, yet the\nroot of the guilt lies in our _essentia et existentia_, for out of these\nthe _operari_ necessarily proceeds, as I have shown in the prize essay on\nthe freedom of the will. Accordingly our one true sin is really original\nsin. Now the Christian myth makes original sin first arise after man came\ninto existence, and for this purpose ascribes to him, _per impossibile_, a\nfree will. It does this, however, simply as myth. The inmost kernel and\nspirit of Christianity is identical with that of Brahmanism and Buddhism;\nthey all teach a great guilt of the human race through its existence\nitself, only that Christianity does not proceed directly and frankly like\nthese more ancient religions: thus does not make the guilt simply the\nresult of existence itself, but makes it arise through the act of the\nfirst human pair. This was only possible under the fiction of a _liberum\narbitrium indifferentiæ_, and only necessary on account of the Jewish\nfundamental dogma, in which that doctrine had here to be implanted.\nBecause, according to the truth, the coming into existence of man himself\nis the act of his free will, and accordingly one with the fall, and\ntherefore the original sin, of which all other sins are the result,\nappeared already with the _essentia_ and _existentia_ of man; but the\nfundamental dogma of Judaism did not admit of such an explanation. Thus\nAugustine taught, in his books _De libero arbitrio_, that only as Adam\nbefore the fall was man guiltless and possessed of a free will, but for\never after is involved in the necessity of sin. The law, ὁ νομος, in the\nBiblical sense, always demands that we shall change our doing, while our\nbeing remains unchanged. But because this is impossible, Paul says that no\nman is justified by the law; only the new birth in Jesus Christ, in\nconsequence of the work of grace, on account of which a new man arises and\nthe old man is abolished (_i.e._, a fundamental change of mind or\nconversion), can transfer us from the state of sinfulness into that of\nfreedom and salvation. This is the Christian myth with reference to\nethics. But certainly the Jewish theism, upon which it was grafted, must\nhave received wonderful additions to adapt itself to that myth. In it the\nfable of the fall presented the only place for the graft of the old Indian\nstem. It is to be attributed just to that forcibly surmounted difficulty\nthat the Christian mysteries have received such an extraordinary\nappearance, conflicting with the ordinary understanding, which makes\nproselytising more difficult, and on account of which, from incapacity to\ncomprehend their profound meaning, Pelagianism, or at the present day\nRationalism, rises against them, and seeks to explain them away, but\nthereby reduces Christianity to Judaism.\n\nBut to speak without myth: so long as our will is the same, our world can\nbe no other than it is. It is true all wish to be delivered from the state\nof suffering and death; they would like, as it is expressed, to attain to\neternal blessedness, to enter the kingdom of heaven, only not upon their\nown feet; they would like to be carried there by the course of nature.\nThat, however, is impossible. Therefore nature will never let us fall and\nbecome nothing; but yet it can lead us nowhere but always again into\nnature. Yet how questionable a thing it is to exist as a part of nature\nevery one experiences in his own life and death. Accordingly existence is\ncertainly to be regarded as an erring, to return from which is salvation:\nit also bears this character throughout. It is therefore conceived in this\nmanner by the ancient Samana religions, and also, although indirectly, by\nreal and original Christianity. Even Judaism itself contains at least in\nthe fall (this its redeeming feature) the germ of such a view. Only Greek\npaganism and Islamism are entirely optimistic: therefore in the former the\nopposite tendency had to find expression at least in tragedy; but in\nIslamism, which is the worst, as it is the most modern, of all religions,\nit appeared as Sufism, that very beautiful phenomenon, which is completely\nof Indian spirit and origin, and has now continued for upwards of a\nthousand years. Nothing can, in fact, be given as the end of our existence\nbut the knowledge that we had better not be. This, however, is the most\nimportant of all truths, which must therefore be expressed, however great\nthe contrast in which it stands with the European manner of thought of the\npresent day. On the other hand, in the whole of non‐Mohammedan Asia it is\nthe most universally recognised fundamental truth, to‐day as much as three\nthousand years ago.\n\nIf now we consider the will to live as a whole and objectively, we have,\nin accordance with what has been said, to think of it as involved in an\nillusion, to escape from which, thus to deny its whole existing endeavour,\nis what all religions denote by self‐renunciation, _abnegatio sui ipsius_;\nfor the true self is the will to live. The moral virtues, thus justice and\nbenevolence, since if they are pure they spring, as I have shown, from the\nfact that the will to live, seeing through the _principium\nindividuationis_, recognises itself in all its manifestations, are\naccordingly primarily a sign, a symptom, that the self‐manifesting will is\nno longer firmly held in that illusion, but the disillusion already begins\nto take place; so that one might metaphorically say it already flaps its\nwings to fly away from it. Conversely, injustice, wickedness, cruelty are\nsigns of the opposite, thus of the deep entanglement in that illusion.\nSecondly, however, these virtues are a means of advancing self‐\nrenunciation, and accordingly the denial of the will to live. For true\nintegrity, inviolable justice, this first and most important of cardinal\nvirtues, is so hard a task that whoever professes it unconditionally and\nfrom the bottom of his heart has to make sacrifices that soon deprive life\nof the sweetness which is demanded to make it enjoyable, and thereby turn\naway the will from it, thus lead to resignation. Yet just what makes\nintegrity honourable is the sacrifices which it costs; in trifles it is\nnot admired. Its nature really consists in this, that the just man does\nnot throw upon others, by craft or force, the burdens and sorrows which\nlife brings with it, as the unjust man does, but bears himself what falls\nto his lot; and thus he has to bear the full burden of the evil imposed\nupon human life, undiminished. Justice thereby becomes a means of\nadvancing the denial of the will to live, for want and suffering, those\ntrue conditions of human life, are its consequence, and these lead to\nresignation. Still more quickly does the virtue of benevolence, _caritas_,\nwhich goes further, lead to the same result; for on account of it one\ntakes over even the sufferings which originally fell to the lot of others,\ntherefore appropriates to oneself a larger share of these than in the\ncourse of things would come to the particular individual. He who is\ninspired with this virtue has recognised his own being in all others. And\nthereby he identifies his own lot with that of humanity in general; but\nthis is a hard lot, that of care, suffering, and death. Whoever, then, by\nrenouncing every accidental advantage, desires for himself no other lot\nthan that of humanity in general cannot desire even this long. The\nclinging to life and its pleasures must now soon yield, and give place to\na universal renunciation; consequently the denial of the will will take\nplace. Since now, in accordance with this, poverty, privation, and special\nsufferings of many kinds are introduced simply by the perfect exercise of\nthe moral virtues, asceticism in the narrowest sense, thus the surrender\nof all possessions, the intentional seeking out of what is disagreeable\nand repulsive, self‐mortification, fasts, the hair shirt, and the\nscourge—all this is rejected by many, and perhaps rightly, as superfluous.\nJustice itself is the hair shirt that constantly harasses its owner and\nthe charity that gives away what is needed, provides constant fasts.(45)\nJust on this account Buddhism is free from all strict and excessive\nasceticism, which plays a large part in Brahmanism, thus from intentional\nself‐mortification. It rests satisfied with the celibacy, voluntary\npoverty, humility, and obedience of the monks, with abstention from animal\nfood, as also from all worldliness. Since, further, the goal to which the\nmoral virtues lead is that which is here pointed out, the Vedanta\nphilosophy(46) rightly says that after the entrance of true knowledge,\nwith entire resignation in its train, thus the new birth, then the\nmorality or immorality of the past life is a matter of indifference, and\nuses here also the saying so often quoted by the Brahmans: “_Finditur\nnodus cordis, dissolvuntur omnes dubitationes, ejusque opera evanescunt,\nviso supremo illo_” (_Sancara, sloca 32_).\n\nNow, however objectionable this view may be to many, to whom a reward in\nheaven or a punishment in hell is a much more satisfactory explanation of\nthe ethical significance of human action, just as the good Windischmann\nrejects that doctrine, while he expounds it, yet whoever is able to go to\nthe bottom of the matter will find that in the end it agrees with that\nChristian doctrine especially urged by Luther, that it is not works but\nonly the faith which enters through the work of grace, that saves us, and\nthat therefore we can never be justified by our deeds, but can only obtain\nthe forgiveness of our sins through the merits of the Mediator. It is\nindeed easy to see that without such assumptions Christianity would have\nto teach infinite punishment for all, and Brahmanism endless re‐births for\nall, thus no salvation would be reached by either. The sinful works and\ntheir consequences must be annulled and annihilated, whether by extraneous\npardon or by the entrance of a better knowledge; otherwise the world could\nhope for no salvation; afterwards, however, they become a matter of\nindifference. This is also the μετανοια και αφεσις ἁμαρτιων, the\nannouncement of which the risen Christ exclusively imposes upon His\nApostles as the sum of their mission (Luke xxiv. 47). The moral virtues\nare really not the ultimate end, but only a step towards it. This step is\nsignified in the Christian myth by the eating of the tree of the knowledge\nof good and evil, with which moral responsibility enters, together with\noriginal sin. The latter itself is in truth the assertion of the will to\nlive: the denial of the will to live, in consequence of the appearance of\na better knowledge, is, on the other hand, salvation. Between these two,\nthen, lies the sphere of morality; it accompanies man as a light upon his\npath from the assertion to the denial of the will, or, mythically, from\noriginal sin to salvation through faith in the mediation of the incarnate\nGod (Avatar); or, according to the teaching of the Vedas, through all re‐\nbirths, which are the consequence of the works in each case, until right\nknowledge appears, and with it salvation (final emancipation), Mokscha,\n_i.e._, reunion with Brahma. The Buddhists, however, with perfect honesty,\nonly indicate the matter negatively, by Nirvana, which is the negation of\nthis world, or of Sansara. If Nirvana is defined as nothing, this only\nmeans that the Sansara contains no single element which could assist the\ndefinition or construction of Nirvana. Just on this account the Jainas,\nwho differ from the Buddhists only in name, call the Brahmans who believe\nin the Vedas Sabdapramans, a nickname which is meant to signify that they\nbelieve upon hearsay what cannot be known or proved (“Asiat. Researches,”\nvol. vi. P. 474).\n\nWhen certain ancient philosophers, such as Orpheus, the Pythagoreans, and\nPlato (_e.g._, in the “Phædo,” pp. 151, 183 _seq._, Bip.; and see _Clem.\nAlex. strom._, iii. p. 400 _seq._), just like the Apostle Paul, lament the\nunion of soul and body, and desire to be freed from it, we understand the\nreal and true meaning of this complaint, since we have recognised, in the\nsecond book, that the body is the will itself, objectively perceived as a\nphenomenon in space.\n\nIn the hour of death it is decided whether the man returns into the womb\nof nature or belongs no more to nature at all, but —— —— ——: for this\nopposite we lack image, conception, and word, just because these are all\ntaken from the objectification of the will, therefore belong to this, and\nconsequently can in no way express the absolute opposite of it, which\naccordingly remains for us a mere negation. However, the death of the\nindividual is in each case the unweariedly repeated question of nature to\nthe will to live, “Hast thou enough? Wilt thou escape from me?” In order\nthat it may occur often enough, the individual life is so short. In this\nspirit are conceived the ceremonies, prayers, and exhortations of the\nBrahmans at the time of death, as we find them preserved in the Upanischad\nin several places; and so also are the Christian provisions for the\nsuitable employment of the hour of death by means of exhortation,\nconfession, communion, and extreme unction: hence also the Christian\nprayers for deliverance from sudden death. That at the present day it is\njust this that many desire only proves that they no longer stand at the\nChristian point of view, which is that of the denial of the will to live,\nbut at that of its assertion, which is the heathen point of view.\n\nBut he will fear least to become nothing in death who has recognised that\nhe is already nothing now, and who consequently no longer takes any share\nin his individual phenomenon, because in him knowledge has, as it were,\nburnt up and consumed the will, so that no will, thus no desire for\nindividual existence, remains in him any more.\n\nIndividuality inheres indeed primarily in the intellect; and the\nintellect, reflecting the phenomenon, belongs to the phenomenon, which has\nthe _principium individuationis_ as its form. But it inheres also in the\nwill, inasmuch as the character is individual: yet the character itself is\nabolished in the denial of the will. Thus individuality inheres in the\nwill only in its assertion, not in its denial. Even the holiness which is\nconnected with every purely moral action depends upon the fact that such\nan action ultimately springs from the immediate knowledge of the numerical\nidentity of the inner nature of all living things.(47) But this identity\nonly really exists in the condition of the denial of the will (Nirvana),\nfor the assertion of the will (Sansara) has for its form the phenomenal\nappearance of it in multiplicity. Assertion of the will to live, the\nphenomenal world, the diversity of all beings, individuality, egoism,\nhatred, wickedness, all spring from _one_ root; and so also, on the other\nhand, do the world as thing in itself, the identity of all beings,\njustice, benevolence, the denial of the will to live. If now, as I have\nsufficiently proved, even the moral virtues spring from the consciousness\nof that identity of all beings, but this lies, not in the phenomenon, but\nonly in the thing in itself, in the root of all beings, the moral action\nis a momentary passing through the point, the permanent return to which is\nthe denial of the will to live.\n\nIt follows, as a deduction from what has been said, that we have no ground\nto assume that there are more perfect intelligences than that of human\nbeings. For we see that even this degree of intelligence is sufficient to\nimpart to the will that knowledge in consequence of which it denies and\nabolishes itself, upon which the individuality, and consequently the\nintelligence, which is merely a tool of individual, and therefore animal\nnature, perish. This will appear to us less open to objection if we\nconsider that we cannot conceive even the most perfect intelligences\npossible, which for this end we may experimentally assume, existing\nthrough an endless time, which would be much too poor to afford them\nconstantly new objects worthy of them. Because the nature of all things is\nat bottom one, all knowledge of them is necessarily tautological. If now\nthis nature once becomes comprehended, as by those most perfect\nintelligences it soon would be comprehended, what would then remain but\nthe wearisomeness of mere repetition through an infinite time? Thus from\nthis side also we are pointed to the fact that the end of all intelligence\ncan only be reaction upon the will; since, however, all willing is an\nerror, it remains the last work of intelligence to abolish the willing,\nwhose ends it had hitherto served. Accordingly even the most perfect\nintelligence possible can only be a transition step to that to which no\nknowledge can ever extend: indeed such an intelligence can, in the nature\nof things, only assume the position of the moment of the attainment of\nperfect insight.\n\nIn agreement with all these considerations, and also with what is proved\nin the second book as to the origin of knowledge in the will, the\n_assertion_ of which it reflects in fulfilling the sole function of\nknowledge, that of being serviceable to the ends of the will, while true\nsalvation lies in its _denial_, we see all religions at their highest\npoint pass over into mysticism and mysteries, _i.e._, into darkness and\nveiled obscurity, which for knowledge signify merely an empty spot, the\npoint where knowledge necessarily ceases; therefore for thought this can\nonly be expressed by negations, but for sense perception it is indicated\nby symbolical signs; in temples by dim light and silence; in Brahmanism\nindeed by the required suspension of all thought and perception for the\nsake of sinking oneself profoundly in the grounds of one’s own being,\nmentally pronouncing the mysterious Oum.(48) Mysticism in the widest sense\nis every guidance to the immediate consciousness of that to which neither\nperception nor conception, thus in general no knowledge extends. The\nmystic is thus opposed to the philosopher by the fact that he begins from\nwithin, while the philosopher begins from without. The mystic starts from\nhis inner, positive, individual experience, in which he finds himself to\nbe the eternal and only being, &c. But nothing of this is communicable\nexcept the assertions which one has to accept upon his word; consequently\nhe cannot convince. The philosopher, on the other hand, starts from what\nis common to all, from the objective phenomenon which lies before all, and\nfrom the facts of consciousness as they are present in all. His method is\ntherefore reflection upon all this, and combination of the data given in\nit: accordingly he can convince. He ought therefore to beware of falling\ninto the way of the mystics, and, for example, by the assertion of\nintellectual intuitions or pretended immediate apprehensions of the\nreason, to seek to make a vain show of positive knowledge of that which is\nfor ever inaccessible to all knowledge, or at the most can be indicated by\nmeans of a negation. The value and worth of philosophy lies in the fact\nthat it rejects all assumptions which cannot be established, and takes as\nits data only what can be certainly proved in the world given in external\nperception, in the forms of apprehension of this world, which are\nconstitutive of our intellect, and in the consciousness of one’s own self\nwhich is common to all. Therefore it must remain cosmology, and cannot\nbecome theology. Its theme must limit itself to the world; to express in\nall aspects what this _is_, what it is in its inmost nature, is all that\nit can honestly achieve. Now it answers to this that my system when it\nreaches its highest point assumes a _negative_ character, thus ends with a\nnegation. It can here speak only of what is denied, given up: but what is\nthereby won, what is laid hold of, it is obliged (at the conclusion of the\nfourth book) to denote as nothing, and can only add the consolation that\nit is merely a relative, not an absolute nothing. For if something is none\nof all the things which we know, it is certainly for us, speaking\ngenerally, nothing. But it does not yet follow from this that it is\nabsolutely nothing, that from every possible point of view and in every\npossible sense it must be nothing, but only that we are limited to a\ncompletely negative knowledge of it, which may very well lie in the\nlimitation of our point of view. Now it is just here that the mystic\nproceeds positively, and therefore it is just from this point that nothing\nbut mysticism remains. However, any one who wishes this kind of supplement\nto the negative knowledge to which alone philosophy can guide him will\nfind it in its most beautiful and richest form in the Oupnekhat, then also\nin the Enneads of Plotinus, in Scotus Erigena, in passages of Jakob Böhm,\nbut especially in the marvellous work of Madame de Guion, _Les Torrens_,\nand in Angelus Silesius; finally also in the poems of the Sufis, of which\nTholuk has given us a collection translated into Latin, and another\ntranslated into German, and in many other works. The Sufis are the\nGnostics of Islam. Hence Sadi denotes them by a word which may be\ntranslated “full of insight.” Theism, calculated with reference to the\ncapacity of the multitude, places the source of existence without us, as\nan object. All mysticism, and so also Sufism, according to the various\ndegrees of its initiation, draws it gradually back within us, as the\nsubject, and the adept recognises at last with wonder and delight that he\nis it himself. This procedure, common to all mysticism, we find not only\nexpressed by Meister Eckhard, the father of German mysticism, in the form\nof a precept for the perfect ascetic, “that he seek not God outside\nhimself” (Eckhard’s works, edited by Pfeiffer, vol. i. p. 626), but also\nvery naïvely exhibited by Eckhard’s spiritual daughter, who sought him\nout, when she had experienced that conversion in herself, to cry out\njoyfully to him, “Sir, rejoice with me, I have become God” (_loc. cit._,\np. 465). The mysticism of the Sufis also expresses itself throughout\nprecisely in accordance with this spirit, principally as a revelling in\nthe consciousness that one is oneself the kernel of the world and the\nsource of all existence, to which all returns. Certainly there also often\nappears the call to surrender all volition as the only way in which\ndeliverance from individual existence and its suffering is possible, yet\nsubordinated and required as something easy. In the mysticism of the\nHindus, on the other hand, the latter side comes out much more strongly,\nand in Christian mysticism it is quite predominant, so that pantheistic\nconsciousness, which is essential to all mysticism, here only appears in a\nsecondary manner, in consequence of the surrender of all volition, as\nunion with God. Corresponding to this difference of the conception,\nMohammedan mysticism has a very serene character, Christian mysticism a\ngloomy and melancholy character, while that of the Hindus, standing above\nboth, in this respect also holds the mean.\n\nQuietism, _i.e._, surrender of all volition, asceticism, _i.e._,\nintentional mortification of one’s own will, and mysticism, _i.e._,\nconsciousness of the identity of one’s own nature with that of all things\nor with the kernel of the world, stand in the closest connection; so that\nwhoever professes one of them is gradually led to accept the others, even\nagainst his intention. Nothing can be more surprising than the agreement\nwith each other of the writers who present these doctrines,\nnotwithstanding the greatest difference of their age, country, and\nreligion, accompanied by the firm certainty and inward confidence with\nwhich they set forth the permanence of their inner experience. They do not\nconstitute a _sect_, which adheres to, defends, and propagates a favourite\ndogma once laid hold of; indeed the Indian, Christian, and Mohammedan\nmystics, quietists, and ascetics are different in every respect, except\nthe inner significance and spirit of their teaching. A very striking\nexample of this is afforded by the comparison of the _Torrens_ of Madame\nde Guion with the teaching of the Vedas, especially with the passage in\nthe Oupnekhat, vol. i. p. 63, which contains the content of that French\nwork in the briefest form, but accurately and even with the same images,\nand yet could not possibly have been known to Madame de Guion in 1680. In\nthe “_Deutschen Theologie_” (the only unmutilated edition, Stuttgart,\n1851) it is said in chapters 2 and 3 that both the fall of the devil and\nthat of Adam consisted in the fact that the one as the other ascribed to\nhimself the I and me, the mine and to me, and on p. 89 it is said: “In\ntrue love there remains neither I nor me, mine, to me, thou, thine, and\nthe like.” Now, corresponding to this, it is said in the “Kural,” from the\nTamilian by Graul, p. 8: “The passion of the mine directed outwardly, and\nthat of the I directed inwardly, cease” (_cf._ ver. 346). And in the\n“Manual of Buddhism” by Spence Hardy, p. 258, Buddha says: “My disciples\nreject the thoughts I am this, or this is mine.” In general, if we look\naway from the forms which are introduced by external circumstances and go\nto the bottom of the matter, we will find that Sakya Muni and Meister\nEckhard teach the same; only that the former dared to express his thoughts\ndirectly, while the latter is obliged to clothe them in the garments of\nthe Christian myth and adapt his expressions to this. He carries this,\nhowever, so far that with him the Christian myth has become little more\nthan a symbolical language, just as the Hellenic myth became for the Neo‐\nPlatonists: he takes it throughout allegorically. In the same respect it\nis worth noticing that the transition of St. Francis from prosperity to\nthe mendicant life is similar to the still greater step of Buddha Sakya\nMuni from prince to beggar, and that, corresponding to this, the life of\nSt. Francis, and also the order he founded, was just a kind of\nSannyasiism. Indeed it deserves to be mentioned that his relationship with\nthe Indian spirit appears also in his great love for the brutes and\nfrequent intercourse with them, when he always calls them his sisters and\nbrothers; and his beautiful Cantico also bears witness to his inborn\nIndian spirit by the praise of the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the\nwater, the fire, and the earth.(49)\n\nEven the Christian quietists must often have had little or no knowledge of\neach other; for example, Molinos and Madame de Guion of Tauler and the\n“_Deutsche Theologie_,” or Gichtel of the former. In any case, the great\ndifference of their culture, in that some of them, like Molinos, were\nlearned, others, like Gichtel and many more, were the reverse, has no\nessential influence upon their teaching. Their great internal agreement,\nalong with the firmness and certainty of their utterances, proves all the\nmore that they speak from real inward experience, from an experience which\ncertainly is not accessible to all, but is possessed only by a few\nfavoured individuals, and therefore has received the name of the work of\ngrace, the reality of which, however, for the above reasons, is not to be\ndoubted. But in order to understand all this one must read the mystics\nthemselves, and not be contented with second‐hand reports of them; for\nevery one must himself be comprehended before one judges concerning him.\nThus to become acquainted with quietism I specially recommend Meister\nEckhard, the “_Deutsche Theologie_,” Tauler, Madame de Guion, Antoinette\nBourignon, the English Bunyan, Molinos(50) and Gichtel. In the same way,\nas practical proofs and examples of the profound seriousness of\nasceticism, the life of Pascal, edited by Reuchlin, together with his\nhistory of the Port‐Royal, and also the _Histoire de Sainte Elisabeth, par\nle comte de Montalembert_, and _La vie de Rancé, par Chateaubriand_, are\nvery well worth reading, but yet by no means exhaust all that is important\nin this class. Whoever has read such writings, and compared their spirit\nwith that of ascetism and quietism as it runs through all works of\nBrahmanism and Buddhism, and speaks in every page, will admit that every\nphilosophy, which must in consistency reject that whole mode of thought,\nwhich it can only do by explaining the representatives of it to be either\nimpostors or mad‐men, must just on this account necessarily be false. But\nall European systems, with the exception of mine, find themselves in this\nposition. Truly it must be an extraordinary madness which, under the most\nwidely different circumstances and persons possible, spoke with such\nagreement, and, moreover, was raised to the position of a chief doctrine\nof their religion, by the most ancient and numerous peoples of the earth,\nsomething like three‐fourths of all the inhabitants of Asia. But no\nphilosophy can leave the theme of quietism and asceticism undecided if the\nquestion is proposed to it; because this theme is, in its matter,\nidentical with that of all metaphysics and ethics. Here then is a point\nupon which I expect and desire that every philosophy, with its optimism,\nshould declare itself. And if, in the judgment of contemporaries, the\nparadoxical and unexampled agreement of my philosophy with quietism and\nasceticism appears as an open stumbling‐block, I, on the contrary, see\njust in that agreement a proof of its sole correctness and truth, and also\na ground of explanation of why it is ignored and kept secret by the\n_Protestant_ universities.\n\nFor not only the religions of the East, but also true Christianity, has\nthroughout that ascetic fundamental character which my philosophy explains\nas the denial of the will to live; although Protestantism, especially in\nits present form, seeks to conceal this. Yet even the open enemies of\nChristianity who have appeared in the most recent times have ascribed to\nit the doctrines of renunciation, self‐denial, perfect chastity, and, in\ngeneral, mortification of the will, which they quite correctly denote by\nthe name of the “_anti‐cosmic tendency_,” and have fully proved that such\ndoctrines are essentially proper to original and genuine Christianity. In\nthis they are undeniably right. But that they set up this as an evident\nand patent reproach to Christianity, while just here lies its profoundest\ntruth, its high value, and its sublime character,—this shows an obscuring\nof the mind, which can only be explained by the fact that these men’s\nminds, unfortunately like thousands more at the present day in Germany,\nare completely spoiled and distorted by the miserable Hegelism, that\nschool of dulness, that centre of misunderstanding and ignorance, that\nmind‐destroying, spurious wisdom, which now at last begins to be\nrecognised as such, and the veneration of which will soon be left to the\nDanish Academy, in whose eyes even that gross charlatan is a _summus\nphilosophus_, for whom it takes the field:—\n\n    “_Car ils suivront la créance et estude,_\n    _De l’ignorante et sotte multitude,_\n    _Dont le plus lourd sera reça pour juge._”\n\n    —RABELAIS.\n\nIn any case, the ascetic tendency is unmistakable in the genuine and\noriginal Christianity as it developed in the writings of the Church\nFathers from its kernel in the New Testament; it is the summit towards\nwhich all strives upwards. As its chief doctrine we find the\nrecommendation of genuine and pure celibacy (this first and most important\nstep in the denial of the will to live), which is already expressed in the\nNew Testament.(51) Strauss also, in his “Life of Jesus” (vol i. p. 618 of\nthe first edition), says, with reference to the recommendation of celibacy\ngiven in Matt. xix. 11 _seq._, “That the doctrine of Jesus may not run\ncounter to the ideas of the present day, men have hastened to introduce\nsurreptitiously the thought that Jesus only praised celibacy with\nreference to the circumstances of the time, and in order to leave the\nactivity of the Apostles unfettered; but there is even less indication of\nthis in the context than in the kindred passage, 1 Cor. vii. 25 _seq._;\nbut we have here again one of the places where _ascetic principles_, such\nas prevailed among the Essenes, and probably still more widely among the\nJews, appear in the teaching of Jesus also.” This ascetic tendency appears\nmore decidedly later than at the beginning, when Christianity, still\nseeking adherents, dared not pitch its demands too high; and by the\nbeginning of the third century it is expressly urged. Marriage, in genuine\nChristianity, is merely a compromise with the sinful nature of man, as a\nconcession, something allowed to those who lack strength to aspire to the\nhighest, an expedient to avoid greater evil: in this sense it receives the\nsanction of the Church in order that the bond may be indissoluble. But\ncelibacy and virginity are set up as the higher consecration of\nChristianity through which one enters the ranks of the elect. Through\nthese alone does one attain the victor’s crown, which even at the present\nday is signified by the wreath upon the coffin of the unmarried, and also\nby that which the bride lays aside on the day of her marriage.\n\nA piece of evidence upon this point, which certainly comes to us from the\nprimitive times of Christianity, is the pregnant answer of the Lord,\nquoted by Clemens Alexandrinus (_Strom._ iii. 6 _et_ 9) from the Gospel of\nthe Egyptians: “Τῃ Σαλωμῃ ὁ κυριος πυνθανομενῃ, μεχρι ποτε θανατος\nισχυσει; μεχρις αν ειπεν, ὑμεις, αἱ γυναικες, τικτετε” (_Salomæ\ninterroganti ____quousque vigebit mors?____ Dominus ____guoadlusque____\ninguit ____vos, mulieres, paritis___). “Τουτ᾽ εστι, μεχρις αν αἱ επιθυμιαι\nενεργωσι” (_Hoc est, quamdiu operabuntur cupiditates_), adds Clement, c.\n9, with which he at once connects the famous passage, Rom. v. 12. Further\non, c. 13, he quotes the words of Cassianus: “Πυνθανομενης της Σαλωμης,\nποτε γνωσθησεται τα περι ὡν ηρετο, εφη ὁ κυριος, ᾽Οταν της αισχυνς ενδυμα\nπατησετε, και ὁταν γενηται τα δυο ἑν, και το αρρεν μετα της θηλειας ουτε\nαρρεν, ουτε θηλυ” (_Cum interrogaret Salome, quando cognoscentur ea, de\nquibus interrogabat, ait Dominus: ____quando pudoris indumentum\nconculcaveritis, et quando duo facto fuerint unum, et masculum cum fæmina\nnec masculum, nec fæminium___), _i.e._, when she no longer needs the veil\nof modesty, since all distinction of sex will have disappeared.\n\nWith regard to this point the heretics have certainly gone furthest: even\nin the second century the Tatianites or Encratites, the Gnostics, the\nMarcionites, the Montanists, Valentinians, and Cassians; yet only because\nwith reckless consistency they gave honour to the truth, and therefore, in\naccordance with the spirit of Christianity, they taught perfect\ncontinence; while the Church prudently declared to be heresy all that ran\ncounter to its far‐seeing policy. Augustine says of the Tatianites:\n“_Nuptias damnant, atque omnino pares eas fornicationibus aliisque\ncorruptionibus faciunt: nec recipiunt in suum numerum conjugio utentem,\nsive marem, sive fœminam. Non vescunlur carnibus, easque abominantur._”\n(_De hœresi ad quod vult Deum. hœr._, 25.) But even the orthodox Fathers\nlook upon marriage in the light indicated above, and zealously preach\nentire continence, the ἁγνεια. Athanasius gives as the cause of marriage:\n“Ὁτι υποπιπτοντες εσμεν τῃ του προπατορος καταδικῃ ... επειδη ὁ\nπροηγουμενος σκοπος του θεου ην, το μη δια γαμου γενεσθαι ἡμας και φθορας;\nἡ δε παραβασις της εντολης του γαμον εισηγαγεν δια το ανομησαι τον Αδαμ.”\n(_Quia subjacemus condemnationi propatoris nostri; ... nam finis, a Deo\nprœlatus, erat, nos non per nuptias et corruptionem fieri: sed\ntransgressio mandati nuptias introduxit, propter legis violationem\nAdœ._—_Exposit. in psalm._ 50). Tertullian calls marriage _genus mali\ninferioris, ex indulgentia ortum_ (_De pudicitia_, c. 16) and says:\n“_Matrimonium et stuprum est commixtio carnis; scilicet cujus\nconcupiscentiam dominus stupro adœquavit. Ergo, inguis, jam et primas, id\nest unas nuptias destruis? Nec immerito: quoniam et ipsœ ex eo constant,\nquod est stuprum_” (_De exhort. castit._, c. 9). Indeed, Augustine himself\ncommits himself entirely to this doctrine and all its results, for he\nsays: “_Novi quosdam, qui murmurent: quid, si, inquiunt, omnes velint ab\nomni concubitu abstinere, unde subsistet genus humanum? Utinam omnes hoc\nvellent! dumtaxat in caritate, de corde puro et conscientia bona, et fide\nnon ficta: multo citius Dei civitas compleretur, ut acceleraretur terminus\nmundi_” (_De bono conjugali_, c. 10). And again: “_Non vos ab hoc studio,\nquo multos ad imitandum vos excitatis, frangat querela vanorum, qui\ndicunt: quomodo subsistet genus humanum, si omnes fuerint continentes?\nQuasi propter aliud retardetur hoc seculum, nisi ut impleatur\nprœdestinatus numerus ille sanctorum, quo citius impleto, profecto nec\nterminus seculi differetur_” (_De bono individuitatis_, c. 23). One sees\nat once that he identifies salvation with the end of the world. The other\npassages in the works of Augustine which bear on this point will be found\ncollected in the “_Confessio Augustiniana e D. Augustini operibus\ncompilata a Hieronymo Torrense_,” 1610, under the headings _De\nmatrimonio_, _De cœlibatu_, &c., and any one may convince himself from\nthese that in ancient, genuine Christianity marriage was only a\nconcession, which besides this was supposed to have only the begetting of\nchildren as its end, that, on the other hand, perfect continence was the\ntrue virtue far to be preferred to this. To those, however, who do not\nwish to go back to the authorities themselves I recommend two works for\nthe purpose of removing any kind of doubt as to the tendency of\nChristianity we are speaking about: Carové, “_Ueber das Cölibatgesetz_,”\n1832, and Lind, “_De cœlibatu Christianorum per tria priora secula_,”\n_Havniœ_, 1839. It is, however, by no means the views of these writers\nthemselves to which I refer, for these are opposed to mine, but solely to\ntheir carefully collected accounts and quotations, which deserve full\nacceptance as quite trustworthy, just because both these writers are\nopponents of celibacy, the former a rationalistic Catholic, and the other\na Protestant candidate in theology, who speaks exactly like one. In the\nfirst‐named work we find, vol. i. p. 166, in that reference, the following\nresult expressed: “In accordance with the Church view, as it may be read\nin canonical Church Fathers, in the Synodal and Papal instructions, and in\ninnumerable writings of orthodox Catholics, perpetual chastity is called a\ndivine, heavenly, angelic virtue, and the obtaining of the assistance of\ndivine grace for this end is made dependent upon earnest prayer. We have\nalready shown that this Augustinian doctrine is by Canisius and in the\ndecrees of the Council of Trent expressed as an unchanging belief of the\nChurch. That, however, it has been retained as a dogma till the present\nday is sufficiently established by the June number, 1831, of the magazine\n‘_Der Katholik_.’ It is said there, p. 263: ‘In Catholicism the observance\nof a perpetual chastity, for the sake of God, appears as in itself the\nhighest merit of man. The view that the observance of continual chastity\nas an end in itself sanctifies and exalts the man is, as every instructed\nCatholic is convinced, deeply rooted in Christianity, both as regards its\nspirit and its express precepts. The decrees of the Council of Trent have\nabolished all possible doubt on this point....’ It must at any rate be\nconfessed by every unprejudiced person, not only that the doctrine\nexpressed by ‘_Der Katholik_’ is really Catholic, but also that the proofs\nadduced may be quite irrefutable for a Catholic reason, because they are\ndrawn so directly from the ecclesiastical view, taken by the Church, of\nlife and its destiny.” It is further said in the same work, p. 270:\n“Although both Paul calls the forbidding to marry a false doctrine, and\nthe still Judaistic author of the Epistle to the Hebrews enjoins that\nmarriage shall be held in honour by all, and the bed kept undefiled (Heb.\nxiii 4), yet the main tendency of these two sacred writers is not on that\naccount to be mistaken. Virginity is for both the perfect state, marriage\nonly a make‐shift for the weak, and only as such to be held inviolable.\nThe highest effort, on the other hand, was directed to complete, material\nputting off of self. The self must turn and refrain from all that tends\nonly to its own pleasure, and that only temporarily.” Lastly, p. 288: “We\nagree with the Abbé Zaccaria, who asserts that celibacy (not the law of\ncelibacy) is before everything to be deduced from the teaching of Christ\nand the Apostle Paul.”\n\nWhat is opposed to this specially Christian view is everywhere and always\nmerely the Old Testament, with its παντα καλα λιαν. This appears with\npeculiar distinctness from that important third book of the Stromata of\nClement, where, arguing against the encratistic heretics mentioned above,\nhe constantly opposes to them only Judaism, with its optimistic history of\ncreation, with which the world‐denying tendency of the New Testament is\ncertainly in contradiction. But the connection of the New Testament with\nthe Old is at bottom only external, accidental, and forced; and the one\npoint at which Christian doctrine can link itself on to the latter is only\nto be found, as has been said, in the story of the fall, which, moreover,\nstands quite isolated in the Old Testament, and is made no further use of.\nBut, in accordance with the account in the Gospels, it is just the\northodox adherents of the Old Testament who bring about the crucifixion of\nthe founder of Christianity, because they find his teaching in conflict\nwith their own. In the said third book of the Stromata of Clement the\nantagonism between optimism with theism on the one hand, and pessimism\nwith ascetic morality on the other, comes out with surprising\ndistinctness. This book is directed against the Gnostics, who just taught\npessimism and asceticism, that is, εγκρατεια (abstinence of every kind,\nbut especially from all sexual satisfaction); on account of which Clement\ncensures them vigorously. But, at the same time, it becomes apparent that\neven the spirit of the Old Testament stands in this antagonism with that\nof the New Testament. For, apart from the fall, which appears in the Old\nTestament like a _hors d’œuvre_, the spirit of the Old Testament is\ndiametrically opposed to that of the New Testament—the former optimistic,\nthe latter pessimistic. Clement himself brings this contradiction out\nprominently at the end of the eleventh chapter (προσαποτεινομενον τον\nΠαυλον τῳ Κριστῃ κ.τ.λ.), although he will not allow that it is a real\ncontradiction, but explains it as only apparent,—like a good Jew, as he\nis. In general it is interesting to see how with Clement the New and the\nOld Testament get mixed up together; and he strives to reconcile them, yet\nfor the most part drives out the New Testament with the Old. Just at the\nbeginning of the third chapter he objects to the Marcionites that they\nfind fault with the creation, after the example of Plato and Pythagoras;\nfor Marcion teaches that nature is bad, made out of bad materials (φυσις\nκακη, εκ τε ὑλης κακης); therefore one ought not to people this world, but\nto abstain from marriage (μη βουλομενοι τον κοσμον συμπληρουν, απεχεσθαι\nγαμου). Now Clement, to whom in general the Old Testament is much more\ncongenial and convincing than the New, takes this very much amiss. He sees\nin it their flagrant ingratitude to and enmity and rebellion against him\nwho has made the world, the just demiurgus, whose work they themselves\nare, and yet despise the use of his creatures, in impious rebellion\n“forsaking the natural opinion” (αντιτασσομενοι τῳ ποιητῃ τῳ σφων, ...\nεγκρατεις τῃ προς τον πεποιηκοτα εχθρᾳ, μη βουλομενοι χρησθαι τοις ὑπ᾽\nαυτου κτισθεισιν, ... ασεβει θεομαχιᾳ των κατα φυσιν εκσταντες λογισμωι).\nAt the same time, in his holy zeal, he will not allow the Marcionites even\nthe honour of originality, but, armed with his well‐known erudition, he\nbrings it against them, and supports his case with the most beautiful\nquotations, that even the ancient philosophers, that Heraclitus and\nEmpedocles, Pythagoras and Plato, Orpheus and Pindar, Herodotus and\nEuripides, and also the Sibyls, lamented deeply the wretched nature of the\nworld, thus taught pessimism. Now in this learned enthusiasm he does not\nobserve that in this way he is just giving the Marcionites water for their\nmill, for he shows that\n\n    “All the wisest of all the ages”\n\nhave taught and sung what they do, but confidently and boldly he quotes\nthe most decided and energetic utterances of the ancients in this sense.\nCertainly they cannot lead him astray. Wise men may mourn the sadness of\nexistence, poets may pour out the most affecting lamentations about it,\nnature and experience may cry out as loudly as they will against\noptimism,—all this does not touch our Church Father: he holds his Jewish\nrevelation in his hand, and remains confident. The demiurgus made the\nworld. From this it is _a priori_ certain that it is excellent, and it may\nlook as it likes. The same thing then takes place with regard to the\nsecond point, the εγκρατεια, through which, according to his view, the\nMarcionites show their ingratitude towards the demiurgus (αχαρισειν τῳ\nδημιουργῳ) and the perversity with which they put from them all his gifts\n(δἰ αντιταξιν προς τον δημιουργον, την χρησιν των κοσμικων παραιτουμενοι).\nHere now the tragic poets have preceded the Encratites (to the prejudice\nof their originality) and have said the same things. For since they also\nlament the infinite misery of existence, they have added that it is better\nto bring no children into such a world; which he now again supports with\nthe most beautiful passages, and, at the same time, accuses the\nPythagoreans of having renounced sexual pleasure on this ground. But all\nthis touches him not; he sticks to his principle that all these sin\nagainst the demiurgus, in that they teach that one ought not to marry,\nought not to beget children, ought not to bring new miserable beings into\nthe world, ought not to provide new food for death (δἰ εγκρατειας ασεβουσι\nεις τε την κτισιν και τον ἁγιον δημιουργον, τον παντοκρατορα μονον θεον,\nκαι διδασκουσι, μη δειν παραδεχεσθαι γαμον και παιδοποιϊαν, μηδε\nαντεισαγειν τῳ κοσμῳ δυστυχησοντας ἑτερους, μηδε επιχορηγειν θανατῳ\nτροφην—c. 6). Since the learned Church Father thus denounces εγκρατεια, he\nseems to have had no presentiment that just after his time the celibacy of\nthe Christian priesthood would be more and more introduced, and finally,\nin the eleventh century, raised to the position of a law, because it is in\nkeeping with the spirit of the New Testament. It is just this spirit which\nthe Gnostics have grasped more profoundly and understood better than our\nChurch Father, who is more Jew than Christian. The conception of the\nGnostics comes out very clearly at the beginning of the ninth chapter,\nwhere the following passage is quoted from the Gospel of the Egyptians:\nΑυτος ειπεν ὁ Σωτηρ, “ηλθον καταλυσαι τα εργα της θηλειας;” θηλειας μεν,\nτης επιθυμιας; εργα δε, γενεσιν και φθοραν (_Ajunt enim dixisse\nServatorem: ____veni ad dissolvendum opera feminæ;____ feminæ quidem,\ncupiditatis; opera autem, generationem et interitum_); but quite specially\nat the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth chapter.\nThe Church certainly was obliged to consider how to set a religion upon\nits legs that could also walk and stand in the world as it is, and among\nmen; therefore it declared these persons to be heretics. At the conclusion\nof the seventh chapter our Church Father opposes Indian asceticism, as\nbad, to Christian Judaism; whereby the fundamental difference of the\nspirit of the two religions is clearly brought out. In Judaism and\nChristianity everything runs back to obedience or disobedience to the\ncommand of God: ὑπακοη και παρακοη; as befits us creatures, ἡμιν, τοις\nπεπλασμενοις ὑπο της του Παντοκρατορος βουλησεως (_nobis, qui Omnipotentis\nvoluntate efficti sumus_), chap. 14. Then comes, as a second duty,\nλατρευειν θεῳ ζωντι, to serve God, extol His works, and overflow with\nthankfulness. Certainly the matter has a very different aspect in\nBrahmanism and Buddhism, for in the latter all improvement and conversion,\nand the only deliverance we can hope for from this world of suffering,\nthis Sansara, proceeds from the knowledge of the four fundamental truths:\n(1) _dolor_; (2) _doloris ortus_; (3) _doloris interitus_; (4)\n_octopartita via ad doloris sedationem_ (_Dammapadam_, ed. Fausböll, p. 35\n_et_ 347). The explanation of these four truths will be found in Bournouf,\n“_Introduct. à l’hist. du Buddhisme_,” p. 629, and in all expositions of\nBuddhism.\n\nIn truth, Judaism, with its παντα καλα λιαν, is not related to\nChristianity as regards its spirit and ethical tendency, but Brahmanism\nand Buddhism are. But the spirit and ethical tendency are what is\nessential in a religion, not the myths in which these are clothed. I\ntherefore cannot give up the belief that the doctrines of Christianity can\nin some way be derived from these primitive religions. I have pointed out\nsome traces of this in the second volume of the Parerga, § 179 (second\nedition, § 180). I have to add to these that Epiphanias (_Hæretic_.\nxviii.) relates that the first Jewish Christians of Jerusalem, who called\nthemselves Nazarenes, refrained from all animal food. On account of this\norigin (or, at least, this agreement) Christianity belongs to the ancient,\ntrue and sublime faith of mankind, which is opposed to the false, shallow,\nand injurious optimism which exhibits itself in Greek paganism, Judaism,\nand Islamism. The Zend religion holds to a certain extent the mean,\nbecause it has opposed to Ormuzd a pessimistic counterpoise in Ahriman.\nFrom this Zend religion the Jewish religion proceeded, as J.G. Rhode has\nthoroughly proved in his book, “_Die heilige Sage des Zendvolks_;” from\nOrmuzd has come Jehovah, and from Ahriman, Satan, who, however, plays only\na very subordinate rôle in Judaism, indeed almost entirely disappears,\nwhereby then optimism gains the upper hand, and there only remains the\nmyth of the fall as a pessimistic element, which certainly (as the fable\nof Meschia and Meschiane) is derived from the Zend‐Avesta. Yet even this\nfalls into oblivion, till it is again taken up by Christianity along with\nSatan. Ormuzd himself, however, is derived from Brahmanism, although from\na lower region of it; he is no other than Indra, that subordinate god of\nthe firmament and the atmosphere, who is represented as frequently in\nrivalry with men. This has been very clearly shown by J.J. Schmidt in his\nwork on the relation of the Gnostic‐theosophic doctrines to the religions\nof the East. This Indra‐Ormuzd‐Jehovah had afterwards to pass over into\nChristianity, because this religion arose in Judæa. But on account of the\ncosmopolitan character of Christianity he laid aside his own name to be\ndenoted in the language of each converted nation by the appellation of the\nsuperhuman beings he supplanted, as, Δεος, _Deus_, which comes from the\nSanscrit _Deva_ (from which also devil comes), or among the Gothico‐\nGermanic peoples by the word God, _Gott_, which comes from _Odin_,\n_Wodan_, _Guodan_, _Godan_. In the same way he assumed in Islamism, which\nalso sprang from Judaism, the name of Allah, which also existed earlier in\nArabia. Analogous to this, the gods of the Greek Olympus, when in\nprehistoric times they were transplanted to Italy, also assumed the names\nof the previously reigning gods: hence among the Romans Zeus is called\nJupiter, Hera Juno, Hermes Mercury, &c. In China the first difficulty of\nthe missionaries arose from the fact that the Chinese language has no\nappellation of the kind and also no word for creating; for the three\nreligions of China know no gods either in the plural or in the\nsingular.(52)\n\nHowever the rest may be, that παντα καλα λιαν of the Old Testament is\nreally foreign to true Christianity; for in the New Testament the world is\nalways spoken of as something to which one does not belong, which one does\nnot love, nay, whose lord is the devil.(53) This agrees with the ascetic\nspirit of the denial of one’s self and the overcoming of the world which,\njust like the boundless love of one’s neighbour, even of one’s enemy, is\nthe fundamental characteristic which Christianity has in common with\nBrahmanism and Buddhism, and which proves their relationship. There is\nnothing in which one has to distinguish the kernel so carefully from the\nshell as in Christianity. Just because I prize this kernel highly I\nsometimes treat the shell with little ceremony; it is, however, thicker\nthan is generally supposed. Protestantism, since it has eliminated\nasceticism and its central point, the meritoriousness of celibacy, has\nalready given up the inmost kernel of Christianity, and so far is to be\nregarded as a falling away from it. This has become apparent in our own\nday by the gradual transition of Protestantism into shallow rationalism,\nthis modern Pelagianism, which ultimately degenerates into the doctrine of\na loving father, who has made the world, in order that things may go on\nvery pleasantly in it (in which case, then, he must certainly have\nfailed), and who, if one only conforms to his will in certain respects,\nwill also afterwards provide a still more beautiful world (with regard to\nwhich it is only a pity that it has such a fatal entrance). That may be a\ngood religion for comfortable, married, and enlightened Protestant\npastors; but it is no Christianity. Christianity is the doctrine of the\ndeep guilt of the human race through its existence alone, and the longing\nof the heart for deliverance from it, which, however, can only be attained\nby the greatest sacrifices and by the denial of one’s own self, thus by an\nentire reversal of human nature. Luther may have been perfectly right from\nthe practical point of view, _i.e._, with reference to the Church scandal\nof his time, which he wished to remove, but not so from the theoretical\npoint of view. The more sublime a doctrine is, the more it is exposed to\nabuse at the hands of human nature, which, on the whole, is of a low and\nevil disposition: hence the abuses of Catholicism are so much more\nnumerous and so much greater than those of Protestantism. Thus, for\nexample, monasticism, that methodical denial of the will practised in\ncommon for the sake of mutual encouragement, is an institution of a\nsublime description, which, however, for this very reason is for the most\npart untrue to its spirit. The shocking abuses of the Church excited in\nthe honest mind of Luther a lofty indignation. But in consequence of this\nhe was led to desire to limit as much as possible the claims of\nChristianity itself, and for this end he first confined it to the words of\nthe Bible; but then, in his well‐meant zeal, he went too far, for he\nattacked the very heart of Christianity in the ascetic principle. For\nafter the withdrawal of the ascetic principle, the optimistic principle\nsoon necessarily took its place. But in religions, as in philosophy,\noptimism is a fundamental error which obstructs the path of all truth.\nFrom all this it seems to me that Catholicism is a shamefully abused, but\nProtestantism a degenerate Christianity; thus, that Christianity in\ngeneral has met the fate which befalls all that is noble, sublime, and\ngreat whenever it has to dwell among men.\n\nHowever, even in the very lap of Protestantism, the essentially ascetic\nand encratistic spirit of Christianity has made way for itself; and in\nthis case it has appeared in a phenomenon which perhaps has never before\nbeen equalled in magnitude and definiteness, the highly remarkable sect of\nthe Shakers, in North America, founded by an Englishwoman, Anne Lee, in\n1774. The adherents of this sect have already increased to 6000, who are\ndivided into fifteen communities, and inhabit a number of villages in the\nstates of New York and Kentucky, especially in the district of New\nLebanon, near Nassau village. The fundamental characteristic of their\nreligious rule of life is celibacy and entire abstention from all sexual\nsatisfaction. It is unanimously admitted, even by the English and\nAmericans who visit them, and who laugh and jeer at them in every other\nrespect, that this rule is strictly and with perfect honesty observed;\nalthough brothers and sisters sometimes even occupy the same house, eat at\nthe same table, nay, _dance_ together in the religious services in church.\nFor whoever has made that hardest of all sacrifices may _dance_ before the\nLord; he is a victor, he has overcome. Their singing in church consists in\ngeneral of cheerful, and partly even of merry, songs. The church‐dance,\nalso, which follows the sermon is accompanied by the singing of the rest.\nIt is a lively dance, performed in measured time, and concludes with a\ngalop, which is carried on till the dancers are exhausted. Between each\ndance one of their teachers cries aloud, “Think, that ye rejoice before\nthe Lord for having slain your flesh; for this is here the only use we\nmake of our refractory limbs.” To celibacy most of the other conditions\nlink themselves on of themselves. There are no families, and therefore\nthere is no private property, but community of goods. All are clothed\nalike, in Quaker fashion, and with great neatness. They are industrious\nand diligent: idleness is not endured. They have also the enviable rule\nthat they are to avoid all unnecessary noise, such as shouting, door‐\nslamming, whip‐cracking, loud knocking, &c. Their rule of life has been\nthus expressed by one of them: “Lead a life of innocence and purity, love\nyour neighbours as yourself, live at peace with all men, and refrain from\nwar, blood‐shed, and all violence against others, as well as from all\nstriving after worldly honour and distinction. Give to each his own, and\nfollow after holiness, without which no man can see the Lord. Do good to\nall so far as your opportunity and your power extends.” They persuade no\none to join them, but test those who present themselves by a novitiate of\nseveral years. Moreover, every one is free to leave them; very rarely is\nany one expelled for misconduct. Adopted children are carefully educated,\nand only when they are grown up do they voluntarily join the sect. It is\nsaid that in the controversies of their ministers with Anglican clergy the\nlatter generally come off the worse, for the arguments consist of passages\nfrom the New Testament. Fuller accounts of them will be found particularly\nin Maxwell’s “Run through the United States,” 1841; also in Benedict’s\n“History of all Religions,” 1830; also in the _Times_, November 4, 1837,\nand in the German magazine _Columbus_, May number, 1831. A German sect in\nAmerica, very similar to them, who also live in strict celibacy and\ncontinence, are the Rappists. An account of them is given in F. Loher’s\n“_Geschichte und Zustande der Deutschen in Amerika_,” 1853. In Russia also\nthe Raskolniks are a similar sect. The Gichtelians live also in strict\nchastity. But among the ancient Jews we already find a prototype of all\nthese sects, the Essenes, of whom even Pliny gives an account (_Hist.\nNat._, v. 15), and who resembled the Shakers very much, not only in\ncelibacy, but also in other respects; for example, in dancing during\ndivine service, which leads to the opinion that the founder of the Shakers\ntook the Essenes as a pattern. In the presence of such facts as these how\ndoes Luther’s assertion look: “_Ubi natura, quemadmodum a Deo nobis insita\nest, fertur ac rapitur_, FIERI NULLO MODO POTEST, _ut extra matrimonium\ncaste vivatur_”? (_Catech. maj._)\n\nAlthough Christianity, in essential respects, taught only what all Asia\nknew long before, and even better, yet for Europe it was a new and great\nrevelation, in consequence of which the spiritual tendency of the European\nnations was therefore entirely transformed. For it disclosed to them the\nmetaphysical significance of existence, and therefore taught them to look\naway from the narrow, paltry, ephemeral life of earth, and to regard it no\nlonger as an end in itself, but as a condition of suffering, guilt, trial,\nconflict, and purification, out of which, by means of moral achievements,\ndifficult renunciation, and denial of oneself, one may rise to a better\nexistence, which is inconceivable by us. It taught the great truth of the\nassertion and denial of the will to live in the clothing of allegory by\nsaying that through Adam’s fall the curse has come upon all, sin has come\ninto the world, and guilt is inherited by all; but that, on the other\nhand, through the sacrificial death of Jesus all are reconciled, the world\nsaved, guilt abolished, and justice satisfied. In order, however, to\nunderstand the truth itself that is contained in this myth one must not\nregard men simply in time, as beings independent of each other, but must\ncomprehend the (Platonic) Idea of man, which is related to the series of\nmen, as eternity in itself is related to eternity drawn out as time; hence\nthe eternal Idea _man_ extended in time to the series of men through the\nconnecting bond of generation appears again in time as a whole. If now we\nkeep the Idea of man in view, we see that Adam’s fall represents the\nfinite, animal, sinful nature of man, in respect of which he is a finite\nbeing, exposed to sin, suffering, and death. On the other hand, the life,\nteaching, and death of Jesus Christ represent the eternal, supernatural\nside, the freedom, the salvation of man. Now every man, as such and\n_potentiâ_, is both Adam and Jesus, according as he comprehends himself,\nand his will thereupon determines him; in consequence of which he is then\ncondemned and given over to death, or saved and attains to eternal life.\nNow these truths, both in their allegorical and in their real acceptation,\nwere completely new as far as Greeks and Romans were concerned, who were\nstill entirely absorbed in life, and did not seriously look beyond it. Let\nwhoever doubts this see how Cicero (_Pro Cluentio_, c. 61) and Sallust\n(_Catil._, c. 47) speak of the state after death. The ancients, although\nfar advanced in almost everything else, remained children with regard to\nthe chief concern, and were surpassed in this even by the Druids, who at\nleast taught metempsychosis. That one or two philosophers, like Pythagoras\nand Plato, thought otherwise alters nothing as regards the whole.\n\nThat great fundamental truth, then, which is contained in Christianity, as\nin Brahmanism and Buddhism, the need of deliverance from an existence\nwhich is given up to suffering and death, and the attainableness of this\nby the denial of the will, thus by a decided opposition to nature, is\nbeyond all comparison the most important truth there can be; but, at the\nsame time, it is entirely opposed to the natural tendency of the human\nrace, and in its true grounds it is difficult to comprehend; as indeed all\nthat can only be thought generally and in the abstract is inaccessible to\nthe great majority of men. Therefore for these men there was everywhere\nrequired, in order to bring that great truth within the sphere of its\npractical application, _a mythical vehicle_ for it, as it were a\nreceptacle, without which it would be lost and dissipated. The truth had\ntherefore everywhere to borrow the garb of the fable, and also constantly\nto endeavour to connect itself with what in each case was historically\ngiven, already familiar, and already revered. What _sensu proprio_\nremained inaccessible to the great mass of mankind of all ages and lands,\nwith their low tone of mind, their intellectual stupidity and general\nbrutality, had, for practical purposes, to be brought home to them _sensu\nallegorico_, in order to become their guiding star. So, then, the\nreligions mentioned above are to be regarded as the sacred vessels in\nwhich the great truth, known and expressed for several thousand years,\nindeed perhaps since the beginning of the human race, which yet in itself,\nfor the great mass of mankind always remains a mystery, is, according to\nthe measure of their powers, made accessible to them, preserved and\ntransmitted through the centuries. Yet, because all that does not through\nand through consist of the imperishable material of pure truth is subject\nto destruction, whenever this fate befalls such a vessel, through contact\nwith a heterogeneous age, its sacred content must in some way be saved and\npreserved for mankind by another. But it is the task of philosophy, since\nit is one with pure truth, to present that content pure and unmixed, thus\nmerely in abstract conceptions, and consequently without that vehicle, for\nthose who are capable of thinking, who are always an exceedingly small\nnumber. It is therefore related to religions as a straight line to several\ncurves running near it: for it expresses _sensu proprio_, thus reaches\ndirectly, what they show in veiled forms and reach by circuitous routes.\n\nIf now, in order to illustrate what has just been said by an example, and\nalso to follow a philosophical fashion of my time, I should wish perhaps\nto attempt to solve the profoundest mystery of Christianity, that of the\nTrinity, in the fundamental conception of my philosophy, this could be\ndone, with the licence permitted in such interpretations, in the following\nmanner. The Holy Ghost is the distinct denial of the will to live: the man\nin whom this exhibits itself _in concreto_ is the Son; He is identical\nwith the will which asserts life, and thereby produces the phenomenon of\nthis perceptible world, _i.e._, with the Father, because the assertion and\ndenial are opposite acts of the same will whose capability for both is the\nonly true freedom. However, this is to be regarded as a mere _lusus\ningenii_.\n\nBefore I close this chapter I wish to adduce a few proofs in support of\nwhat in § 68 of the first volume I denoted by the expression Δευτυρος\nπλους, the bringing about of the denial of the will by one’s own deeply\nfelt suffering, thus not merely by the appropriation of the suffering of\nothers, and the knowledge of the vanity and wretchedness of our existence\nintroduced by this. We can arrive at a comprehension of what goes on in\nthe heart of a man, in the case of an elevation of this kind and the\naccompanying purifying process, by considering what every emotional man\nexperiences on beholding a tragedy, which is of kindred nature to this. In\nthe third and fourth acts perhaps such a man is distressed and disturbed\nby the ever more clouded and threatened happiness of the hero; but when,\nin the fifth act, this happiness is entirely wrecked and shattered, he\nexperiences a certain elevation of the soul, which affords him an\ninfinitely higher kind of pleasure than the sight of the happiness of the\nhero, however great it might be, could ever have given. Now this is the\nsame thing, in the weak water‐colours of sympathy which is able to raise a\nwell‐known illusion, as that which takes place with the energy of reality\nin the feeling of our own fate when it is heavy misfortune that drives the\nman at last into the haven of entire resignation. Upon this occurrence\ndepend all those conversions which completely transform men such as are\ndescribed in the text. I may give here in a few words the story of the\nconversion of the Abbé Rancé, as it is strikingly similar to that of\nRaymond Lully, which is told in the text, and besides this is memorable on\naccount of its result. His youth was devoted to enjoyment and pleasure;\nfinally, he lived in a relation of passion with a Madame de Montbazon. One\nevening, when he visited her, he found her room empty, in disorder and\ndarkness. He struck something with his foot; it was her head, which had\nbeen severed from the trunk, because after her sudden death her corpse\ncould not otherwise be got into the lead coffin that stood beside it.\nAfter overcoming an immense sorrow, Rancé now became, in 1663, the\nreformer of the order of the Trappists, which at that time had entirely\nrelaxed the strictness of its rules. He joined this order, and through him\nit was led back to that terrible degree of renunciation which is still\nmaintained at the present day at La Trappe, and, as the methodically\ncarried out denial of the will, aided by the severest renunciation and an\nincredibly hard and painful manner of life, fills the visitor with sacred\nawe, after he has been touched at his reception by the humility of these\ngenuine monks, who, emaciated by fasting, by cold, by night watches,\nprayers and penances, kneel before him, the worldling and the sinner, to\nimplore his blessing. Of all orders of monks, this one alone has\nmaintained itself in perfection in France, through all changes; which is\nto be attributed to the profound earnestness which in it is unmistakable,\nand excludes all secondary ends. It has remained untouched even by the\ndecline of religion, because its root lies deeper in human nature than any\npositive system of belief.\n\nI have mentioned in the text that this great and rapid change of the\ninmost being of man which we are here considering, and which has hitherto\nbeen entirely neglected by philosophers, appears most frequently when,\nwith full consciousness, he stands in the presence of a violent and\ncertain death, thus in the case of executions. But, in order to bring this\nprocess much more distinctly before our eyes, I regard it as by no means\nunbecoming to the dignity of philosophy to quote what has been said by\nsome criminals before their execution, even at the risk of incurring the\nsneer that I encourage gallows’ sermons. I certainly rather believe that\nthe gallows is a place of quite peculiar revelations, and a watch‐tower\nfrom which the man who even then retains his presence of mind obtains a\nwider, clearer outlook into eternity than most philosophers over the\nparagraphs of their rational psychology and theology. The following speech\non the gallows was made on the 15th April, 1837, at Gloucester, by a man\ncalled Bartlett, who had murdered his mother‐in‐law: “Englishmen and\nfellow countrymen,—I have a few words to say to you, and they shall be but\nvery few. Yet let me entreat you, one and all, that these few words that I\nshall utter may strike deep into your hearts. Bear them in your mind, not\nonly now while you are witnessing this sad scene, but take them to your\nhomes, take them, and repeat them to your children and friends. I implore\nyou as a dying man—one for whom the instrument of death is even now\nprepared—and these words are that you may loose yourselves from the love\nof this dying world and its vain pleasures. Think less of it and more of\nyour God. Do this: repent, repent, for be assured that without deep and\ntrue repentance, without turning to your heavenly Father, you will never\nattain, nor can hold the slightest hope of ever reaching those bowers of\nbliss to which I trust I am now fast advancing” (_Times_, 18th April\n1837).\n\nStill more remarkable are the last words of the well‐known murderer,\nGreenacre, who was executed in London on the 1st of May 1837. The English\nnewspaper the _Post_ gives the following account, which is also reprinted\nin _Galignani’s Messenger_ of the 6th of May 1837: “On the morning of his\nexecution a gentleman advised him to put his trust in God, and pray for\nforgiveness through the mediation of Jesus Christ. Greenacre replied that\nforgiveness through the mediation of Christ was a matter of opinion; for\nhis part, he believed that in the sight of the highest Being, a Mohammedan\nwas as good as a Christian and had just as much claim to salvation. Since\nhis imprisonment he had had his attention directed to theological\nsubjects, and he had become convinced that the gallows is a passport to\nheaven.” The indifference displayed here towards positive religions is\njust what gives this utterance greater weight, for it shows that it is no\nfanatical delusion, but individual immediate knowledge that lies at its\nfoundation. The following incident may also be mentioned which is given by\n_Galignani’s Messenger_ of the 15th August 1837, from the _Limerick\nChronicle_: “Last Monday Maria Cooney was executed for the revolting\nmurder of Mrs. Anderson. So deeply was this wretched woman impressed with\nthe greatness of her crime that she kissed the rope which was put round\nher neck, while she humbly implored the mercy of God.” Lastly this: the\n_Times_, of the 29th April 1845 gives several letters which Hocker, who\nwas condemned for the murder of Delarue, wrote the day before his\nexecution. In one of these he says: “I am persuaded that unless the\nnatural heart be broken, and renewed by divine mercy, however noble and\namiable it may be deemed by the world, it can never think of eternity\nwithout inwardly shuddering.” These are the outlooks into eternity\nreferred to above which are obtained from that watch‐tower; and I have had\nthe less hesitation in giving them here since Shakspeare also says—\n\n        “Out of these convertites\n    There is much matter to be heard and learned.”\n\n    —_As You Like it_, last scene.\n\nStrauss, in his “Life of Jesus,” has proved that Christianity also\nascribes to suffering as such the purifying and sanctifying power here set\nforth (_Leben Jesu_, vol. i. ch. 6, §§ 72 and 74). He says that the\nbeatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount have a different sense in Luke (vi.\n21) from that which they have in Matt. (v. 3), for only the latter adds τῳ\nπνευματι to μακαριοι οἱ πτωχοι, and την δικαιοσυνην to πεινωντες. Thus by\nhim alone are the simple‐minded, the humble, &c., meant, while by Luke are\nmeant the literally poor; so that here the contrast is that between\npresent suffering and future happiness. With the Ebionites it is a capital\nprinciple that whoever takes his portion in this age gets nothing in the\nfuture, and conversely. Accordingly in Luke the blessings are followed by\nas many ουαι, woes, which are addressed to the rich, οἱ πλουσιοι, the\nfull, οἱ εμπεπλησμενοι, and to them that laugh, οἱ γελωντες, in the\nEbionite spirit. In the same spirit, he says, p. 604, is the parable (Luke\nxvi. 19) of the rich man and Lazarus given, which nowhere mentions any\nfault of the former or any merit of the latter, and takes as the standard\nof the future recompense, not the good done or the wickedness practised,\nbut the evil suffered here and the good things enjoyed, in the Ebionite\nspirit. “A like estimation of outward poverty,” Strauss goes on, “is also\nattributed to Jesus by the other synoptists (Matt. xix. 16; Mark x. 17;\nLuke xviii. 18), in the story of the rich young man and the saying about\nthe camel and the eye of a needle.”\n\nIf we go to the bottom of the matter we will recognise that even in the\nmost famous passages of the Sermon on the Mount there is contained an\nindirect injunction to voluntary poverty, and thereby to the denial of the\nwill to live. For the precept (Matt. v. 40 _seq._) to consent\nunconditionally to all demands made upon us, to give our cloak also to him\nwho will take away our coat, &c., similarly (Matt. vi. 25‐34) the precept\nto cast aside all care for the future, even for the morrow, and so to live\nsimply in the present, are rules of life the observance of which\ninevitably leads to absolute poverty, and which therefore just say in an\nindirect manner what Buddha directly commands his disciples and has\nconfirmed by his own example: throw everything away and become bhikkhu,\n_i.e._, beggars. This appears still more decidedly in the passage Matt. x.\n9‐15, where all possessions, even shoes and a staff, are forbidden to the\nApostles, and they are directed to beg. These commands afterwards became\nthe foundation of the mendicant order of St. Francis (_Bonaventuræ vita S.\nFrancisci_, c. 3). Hence, then, I say that the spirit of Christian ethics\nis identical with that of Brahmanism and Buddhism. In conformity with the\nwhole view expounded here Meister Eckhard also says (Works, vol. i. p.\n492): “The swiftest animal that bears thee to perfection is suffering.”\n\nChapter XLIX. The Way Of Salvation.\n\nThere is only one inborn error, and that is, that we exist in order to be\nhappy. It is inborn in us because it is one with our existence itself, and\nour whole being is only a paraphrase of it, nay, our body is its monogram.\nWe are nothing more than will to live and the successive satisfaction of\nall our volitions is what we think in the conception of happiness.\n\nAs long as we persist in this inborn error, indeed even become rigidly\nfixed in it through optimistic dogmas, the world appears to us full of\ncontradictions. For at every step, in great things as in small, we must\nexperience that the world and life are by no means arranged with a view to\ncontaining a happy existence. While now by this the thoughtless man only\nfinds himself tormented in reality, in the case of him who thinks there is\nadded to his real pain the theoretical perplexity why a world and a life\nwhich exist in order that one may be happy in them answer their end so\nbadly. First of all it finds expression in pious ejaculations, such as,\n“Ah! why are the tears on earth so many?” &c. &c. But in their train come\ndisquieting doubts about the assumptions of those preconceived optimistic\ndogmas. One may try if one will to throw the blame of one’s individual\nunhappiness now upon the circumstances, now upon other men, now upon one’s\nown bad luck, or even upon one’s own awkwardness, and may know well how\nall these have worked together to produce it; but this in no way alters\nthe result that one has missed the real end of life, which consists indeed\nin being happy. The consideration of this is, then, often very depressing,\nespecially if life is already on the wane; hence the countenances of\nalmost all elderly persons wear the expression of that which in English is\ncalled disappointment. Besides this, however, hitherto every day of our\nlife has taught us that joys and pleasures, even if attained, are in\nthemselves delusive, do not perform what they promise, do not satisfy the\nheart, and finally their possession is at least embittered by the\ndisagreeables that accompany them or spring from them; while, on the\ncontrary, the pains and sorrows prove themselves very real, and often\nexceed all expectation. Thus certainly everything in life is calculated to\nrecall us from that original error, and to convince us that the end of our\nexistence is not to be happy. Indeed, if we regard it more closely and\nwithout prejudice, life rather presents itself as specially intended to be\nsuch that we shall _not_ feel ourselves happy in it, for through its whole\nnature it bears the character of something for which we have no taste,\nwhich must be endured by us, and from which we have to return as from an\nerror that our heart may be cured of the passionate desire of enjoyment,\nnay, of life, and turned away from the world. In this sense, it would be\nmore correct to place the end of life in our woe than in our welfare. For\nthe considerations at the conclusion of the preceding chapter have shown\nthat the more one suffers the sooner one attains to the true end of life,\nand that the more happily one lives the longer this is delayed. The\nconclusion of the last letter of Seneca corresponds with this: _bonum tunc\nhabebis tuum, quum intelliges infelicissimos esse felices_; which\ncertainly seems to show the influence of Christianity. The peculiar effect\nof the tragic drama also ultimately depends upon the fact that it shakes\nthat inborn error by vividly presenting in a great and striking example\nthe vanity of human effort and the nothingness of this whole existence,\nand thus discloses the profound significance of life; hence it is\nrecognised as the sublimest form of poetry. Whoever now has returned by\none or other path from that error which dwells in us _a priori_, that\nπρωτου ψευδος of our existence, will soon see all in another light, and\nwill now find the world in harmony with his insight, although not with his\nwishes. Misfortunes of every kind and magnitude, although they pain him,\nwill no longer surprise him, for he has come to see that it is just pain\nand trouble that tend towards the true end of life, the turning away of\nthe will from it. This will give him indeed a wonderful composedness in\nall that may happen, similar to that with which a sick person who\nundergoes a long and painful cure bears the pain of it as a sign of its\nefficacy. In the whole of human existence suffering expresses itself\nclearly enough as its true destiny. Life is deeply sunk in suffering, and\ncannot escape from it; our entrance into it takes place amid tears, its\ncourse is at bottom always tragic, and its end still more so. There is an\nunmistakable appearance of intention in this. As a rule man’s destiny\npasses through his mind in a striking manner, at the very summit of his\ndesires and efforts, and thus his life receives a tragic tendency by\nvirtue of which it is fitted to free him from the passionate desire of\nwhich every individual existence is an example, and bring him into such a\ncondition that he parts with life without retaining a single desire for it\nand its pleasures. Suffering is, in fact, the purifying process through\nwhich alone, in most cases, the man is sanctified, _i.e._, is led back\nfrom the path of error of the will to live. In accordance with this, the\nsalutary nature of the cross and of suffering is so often explained in\nChristian books of edification, and in general the cross, an instrument of\nsuffering, not of doing, is very suitably the symbol of the Christian\nreligion. Nay, even the Preacher, who is still Jewish, but so very\nphilosophical, rightly says: “Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the\nsadness of the countenance the heart is made better” (Eccles. vii. 3).\nUnder the name of the δεντρος πλους I have presented suffering as to a\ncertain extent a substitute for virtue and holiness; but here I must make\nthe bold assertion that, taking everything into consideration, we have\nmore to hope for our salvation and deliverance from what we suffer than\nfrom what we do. Precisely in this spirit Lamartine very beautifully says\nin his “_Hymne à la douleur_,” apostrophising pain:—\n\n    “_Tu me traites sans doute en favori des cieux,_\n    _Car tu n’épargnes pas les larmes à mes yeux._\n    _Eh bien! je les reçois comme tu les envoies,_\n    _Tes maux seront mes biens, et tes soupirs mes joies._\n    _Je sens qu’il est en toi, sans avoir combattu,_\n    _Une vertu divine au lieu de ma vertu,_\n    _Que tu n’es pas la mort l’âme, mais sa vie,_\n    _Que ton bras, en frappant, guérit et vivifie._”\n\nIf, then, suffering itself has such a sanctifying power, this will belong\nin an even higher degree to death, which is more feared than any\nsuffering. Answering to this, a certain awe, kindred to that which great\nsuffering occasions us, is felt in the presence of every dead person,\nindeed every case of death presents itself to a certain extent as a kind\nof apotheosis or canonisation; therefore we cannot look upon the dead body\nof even the most insignificant man without awe, and indeed, extraordinary\nas the remark may sound in this place, in the presence of every corpse the\nwatch goes under arms. Dying is certainly to be regarded as the real aim\nof life: in the moment of death all that is decided for which the whole\ncourse of life was only the preparation and introduction. Death is the\nresult, the _Résumé_ of life, or the added up sum which expresses at once\nthe instruction which life gave in detail, and bit by bit; this, that the\nwhole striving whose manifestation is life was a vain, idle, and self‐\ncontradictory effort, to have returned from which is a deliverance. As the\nwhole, slow vegetation of the plant is related to the fruit, which now at\na stroke achieves a hundredfold what the plant achieved gradually and bit\nby bit, so life, with its obstacles, deluded hopes, frustrated plans, and\nconstant suffering, is related to death, which at one stroke destroys all,\nall that the man has willed, and so crowns the instruction which life gave\nhim. The completed course of life upon which the dying man looks back has\nan effect upon the whole will that objectifies itself in this perishing\nindividuality, analogous to that which a motive exercises upon the conduct\nof the man. It gives it a new direction, which accordingly is the moral\nand essential result of the life. Just because a sudden death makes this\nretrospect impossible, the Church regards such a death as a misfortune,\nand prays that it should be averted. Since this retrospect, like the\ndistinct foreknowledge of death, as conditioned by the reason, is possible\nonly in man, not in the brute, and accordingly man alone really drinks the\ncup of death, humanity is the only material in which the will can deny\nitself and entirely turn away from life. To the will that does not deny\nitself every birth imparts a new and different intellect,—till it has\nlearned the true nature of life, and in consequence of this wills it no\nmore.\n\nIn the natural course, in age the decay of the body coincides with that of\nthe will. The desire for pleasures soon vanishes with the capacity to\nenjoy them. The occasion of the most vehement willing, the focus of the\nwill, the sexual impulse, is first extinguished, whereby the man is placed\nin a position which resembles the state of innocence which existed before\nthe development of the genital system. The illusions, which set up\nchimeras as exceedingly desirable benefits, vanish, and the knowledge of\nthe vanity of all earthly blessings takes their place. Selfishness is\nrepressed by the love of one’s children, by means of which the man already\nbegins to live more in the ego of others than in his own, which now will\nsoon be no more. This course of life is at least the desirable one; it is\nthe euthanasia of the will. In hope of this the Brahman is ordered, after\nhe has passed the best years of his life, to forsake possessions and\nfamily, and lead the life of a hermit (_Menu_, B. 6), But if, conversely,\nthe desire outlives the capacity for enjoyment, and we now regret\nparticular pleasures in life which we miss, instead of seeing the\nemptiness and vanity of all; and if then gold, the abstract representative\nof the objects of desire for which the sense is dead, takes the place of\nall these objects themselves, and now excites the same vehement passions\nwhich were formerly more pardonably awakened by the objects of actual\npleasure, and thus now with deadened senses a lifeless but indestructible\nobject is desired with equally indestructible eagerness; or, also, if, in\nthe same way, existence in the opinion of others takes the place of\nexistence and action in the real world, and now kindles the same\npassions;—then the will has become sublimated and etherealised into\navarice or ambition; but has thereby thrown itself into the last fortress,\nin which it can only now be besieged by death. The end of existence has\nbeen missed.\n\nAll these considerations afford us a fuller explanation of that\npurification, conversion of the will and deliverance, denoted in the\npreceding chapter by the expression δευτερος πλους which is brought about\nby the suffering of life, and without doubt is the most frequent. For it\nis the way of sinners such as we all are. The other way, which leads to\nthe same goal, by means of mere knowledge and the consequent appropriation\nof the suffering of a whole world, is the narrow path of the elect, the\nsaints, and therefore to be regarded as a rare exception. Therefore\nwithout that first way for most of us there would be no salvation to hope\nfor. However, we struggle against entering upon it, and strive rather to\nprocure for ourselves a safe and agreeable existence, whereby we chain our\nwill ever more firmly to life. The conduct of the ascetics is the opposite\nof this. They make their life intentionally as poor, hard, and empty of\npleasure as possible, because they have their true and ultimate welfare in\nview. But fate and the course of things care for us better than we\nourselves, for they frustrate on all sides our arrangements for an utopian\nlife, the folly of which is evident enough from its brevity, uncertainty,\nand emptiness, and its conclusion by bitter death; they strew thorns upon\nthorns in our path, and meet us everywhere with healing sorrow, the\npanacea of our misery. What really gives its wonderful and ambiguous\ncharacter to our life is this, that two diametrically opposite aims\nconstantly cross each other in it; that of the individual will directed to\nchimerical happiness in an ephemeral, dream‐like, and delusive existence,\nin which, with reference to the past, happiness and unhappiness are a\nmatter of indifference, and the present is every moment becoming the past;\nand that of fate visibly enough directed to the destruction of our\nhappiness, and thereby to the mortification of our will and the abolition\nof the illusion that holds us chained in the bonds of this world.\n\nThe prevalent and peculiarly Protestant view that the end of life lies\nsolely and immediately in the moral virtues, thus in the practice of\njustice and benevolence, betrays its insufficiency even in the fact that\nso miserably little real and pure morality is found among men. I am not\nspeaking at all of lofty virtue, nobleness, magnanimity, and self‐\nsacrifice, which one hardly finds anywhere but in plays and novels, but\nonly of those virtues which are the duty of every one. Let whoever is old\nthink of all those with whom he has had to do; how many persons will he\nhave met who were merely really and truly _honest_? Were not by far the\ngreater number, in spite of their shameless indignation at the slightest\nsuspicion of dishonesty or even untruthfulness, in plain words, the\nprecise opposite? Were not abject selfishness, boundless avarice, well‐\nconcealed knavery, and also poisonous envy and fiendish delight in the\nmisfortunes of others so universally prevalent that the slightest\nexception was met with surprise? And benevolence, how very rarely it\nextends beyond a gift of what is so superfluous that one never misses it.\nAnd is the whole end of existence to lie in such exceedingly rare and weak\ntraces of morality? If we place it, on the contrary, in the entire\nreversal of this nature of ours (which bears the evil fruits just\nmentioned) brought about by suffering, the matter gains an appearance of\nprobability and is brought into agreement with what actually lies before\nus. Life presents itself then as a purifying process, of which the\npurifying lye is pain. If the process is carried out, it leaves behind it\nthe previous immorality and wickedness as refuse, and there appears what\nthe Veda says: “_Finditur nodus cordis, dissolvuntur omnes dubitationes,\nejusque opera evanescunt._” As agreeing with this view the fifteenth\nsermon of Meister Eckhard will be found very well worth reading.\n\nChapter L. Epiphilosophy.\n\nAt the conclusion of my exposition a few reflections concerning my\nphilosophy itself may find their place. My philosophy does not pretend to\nexplain the existence of the world in its ultimate grounds: it rather\nsticks to the facts of external and internal experience as they are\naccessible to every one, and shows the true and deepest connection of them\nwithout really going beyond them to any extra‐mundane things and their\nrelations to the world. It therefore arrives at no conclusions as to what\nlies beyond all possible experience, but affords merely an exposition of\nwhat is given in the external world and in self‐consciousness, thus\n\nThe ἑν και παν, _i.e._, that the inner nature in all things is absolutely\none and the same, my age had already grasped and understood, after the\nEleatics, Scotus Erigena, Giordano Bruno, and Spinoza had thoroughly\ntaught, and Schelling had revived this doctrine. But _what_ this one is,\nand how it is able to exhibit itself as the many, is a problem the\nsolution of which is first found in my philosophy. Certainly from the most\nancient times man had been called the microcosm. I have reversed the\nproposition, and shown the world as the macranthropos: because will and\nidea exhaust its nature as they do that of man. But it is clearly more\ncorrect to learn to understand the world from man than man from the world;\nfor one has to explain what is indirectly given, thus external perception\nfrom what is directly given, thus self‐consciousness—not conversely.\n\nWith the Pantheists, then, I have certainly that ἑν και παν in common, but\nnot the παν θεος; because I do not go beyond experience (taken in its\nwidest sense), and still less do I put myself in contradiction with the\ndata which lie before me. Scotus Erigena, quite consistently with the\nspirit of Pantheism, explains every phenomenon as a theophany; but then\nthis conception must also be applied to the most terrible and abominable\nphenomena. Fine theophanies! What further distinguishes me from Pantheism\nis principally the following. (1). That their θεος is an _x_, an unknown\nquantity; the will, on the other hand, is of all possible things the one\nthat is known to us most exactly, the only thing given immediately, and\ntherefore exclusively fitted for the explanation of the rest. For what is\nunknown must always be explained by what is better known; not conversely.\n(2). That their θεος manifests himself _animi causa_, to unfold his glory,\nor, indeed, to let himself be admired. Apart from the vanity here\nattributed to him, they are placed in the position of being obliged to\nsophisticate away the colossal evil of the world; but the world remains in\nglaring and terrible contradiction with that imagined excellence. With me,\non the contrary, the _will_ arrives through its objectification however\nthis may occur, at self‐knowledge, whereby its abolition, conversion,\nsalvation becomes possible. And accordingly, with me alone ethics has a\nsure foundation and is completely worked out in agreement with the sublime\nand profound religions, Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Christianity, not merely\nwith Judaism and Mohammedanism. The metaphysic of the beautiful also is\nfirst fully cleared up as a result of my fundamental truth, and no longer\nrequires to take refuge behind empty words. With me alone is the evil of\nthe world honestly confessed in its whole magnitude: this is rendered\npossible by the fact that the answer to the question as to its origin\ncoincides with the answer to the question as to the origin of the world.\nOn the other hand, in all other systems, since they are all optimistic,\nthe question as to the origin of evil is the incurable disease, ever\nbreaking out anew, with which they are affected, and in consequence of\nwhich they struggle along with palliatives and quack remedies. (3.) That I\nstart from experience and the natural self‐consciousness given to every\none, and lead to the will as that which alone is metaphysical; thus I\nadopt the ascending, analytical method. The Pantheists, again, adopt the\nopposite method, the descending or synthetical. They start from their\nθεος, which they beg or take by force, although sometimes under the name\n_substantia_, or absolute, and this unknown is then supposed to explain\neverything that is better known. (4.) That with me the world does not fill\nthe whole possibility of all being, but in this there still remains much\nroom for that which we denote only negatively as the denial of the will to\nlive. Pantheism, on the other hand, is essentially optimism: but if the\nworld is what is best, then the matter may rest there. (5.) That to the\nPantheists the perceptible world, thus the world of idea, is just the\nintentional manifestation of the God indwelling in it, which contains no\nreal explanation of its appearance, but rather requires to be explained\nitself. With me, on the other hand, the world as idea appears merely _per\naccidens_, because the intellect, with its external perception, is\nprimarily only the medium of motives for the more perfect phenomena of\nwill, which gradually rises to that objectivity of perceptibility, in\nwhich the world exists. In this sense its origin, as an object of\nperception, is really accounted for, and not, as with the Pantheists, by\nmeans of untenable fictions.\n\nSince, in consequence of the Kantian criticism of all speculative\ntheology, the philosophisers of Germany almost all threw themselves back\nupon Spinoza, so that the whole series of futile attempts known by the\nname of the post‐Kantian philosophy are simply Spinozism tastelessly\ndressed up, veiled in all kinds of unintelligible language, and otherwise\ndistorted, I wish, now that I have explained the relation of my philosophy\nto Pantheism in general, to point out its relation to Spinozism in\nparticular. It stands, then, to Spinozism as the New Testament stands to\nthe Old. What the Old Testament has in common with the New is the same\nGod‐Creator. Analogous to this, the world exists, with me as with Spinoza,\nby its inner power and through itself. But with Spinoza his _substantia\næterna_, the inner nature of the world, which he himself calls God, is\nalso, as regards its moral character and worth, Jehovah, the God‐Creator,\nwho applauds His own creation, and finds that all is very good, παντα καλα\nλιαν. Spinoza has deprived Him of nothing but personality. Thus, according\nto him also, the world and all in it is wholly excellent and as it ought\nto be: therefore man has nothing more to do than _vivere, agere, suum Esse\nconservare ex fundamento proprium utile quærendi_ (_Eth._, iv. pr. 67); he\nis even to rejoice in his life as long as it lasts; entirely in accordance\nwith Ecclesiastes ix. 7‐10. In short, it is optimism: therefore its\nethical side is weak, as in the Old Testament; nay, it is even false, and\nin part revolting.(54) With me, on the other hand, the will, or the inner\nnature of the world, is by no means Jehovah, it is rather, as it were, the\ncrucified Saviour, or the crucified thief, according as it resolves.\nTherefore my ethical teaching agrees with that of Christianity, completely\nand in its highest tendencies, and not less with that of Brahmanism and\nBuddhism. Spinoza could not get rid of the Jews; _quo semel est imbuta\nrecens servabit odorem_. His contempt for the brutes, which, as mere\nthings for our use, he also declares to be without rights, is thoroughly\nJewish, and, in union with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and\ndetestable (_Eth._, iv., appendix, c. 27). With all this Spinoza remains a\nvery great man. But in order to estimate his work correctly we must keep\nin view his relation to Descartes. The latter had sharply divided nature\ninto mind and matter, _i.e._, thinking and extended substance, and had\nalso placed God and the world in complete opposition to each other;\nSpinoza also, so long as he was a Cartesian, taught all that in his\n“_Cogitatis Metaphysicis_,” c. 12, i. I., 1665. Only in his later years\ndid he see the fundamental falseness of that double dualism; and\naccordingly his own philosophy principally consists of the indirect\nabolition of these two antitheses. Yet partly to avoid injuring his\nteacher, partly in order to be less offensive, he gave it a positive\nappearance by means of a strictly dogmatic form, although its content is\nchiefly negative. His identification of the world with God has also this\nnegative significance alone. For to call the world God is not to explain\nit: it remains a riddle under the one name as under the other. But these\ntwo negative truths had value for their age, as for every age in which\nthere still are conscious or unconscious Cartesians. He makes the mistake,\ncommon to all philosophers before Locke, of starting from conceptions,\nwithout having previously investigated their origin, such, for example, as\nsubstance, cause, &c., and in such a method of procedure these conceptions\nthen receive a much too extensive validity. Those who in the most recent\ntimes refused to acknowledge the Neo‐Spinozism which had appeared, for\nexample, Jacobi, were principally deterred from doing so by the bugbear of\nfatalism. By this is to be understood every doctrine which refers the\nexistence of the world, together with the critical position of mankind in\nit, to any absolute necessity, _i.e._, to a necessity that cannot be\nfurther explained. Those who feared fatalism, again, believed that all\nthat was of importance was to deduce the world from the free act of will\nof a being existing outside it; as if it were antecedently certain which\nof the two was more correct, or even better merely in relation to us. What\nis, however, especially assumed here is the _non datur tertium_, and\naccordingly hitherto every philosophy has represented one or the other. I\nam the first to depart from this; for I have actually established the\n_Tertium_: the act of will from which the world arises is our own. It is\nfree; for the principle of sufficient reason, from which alone all\nnecessity derives its significance, is merely the form of its phenomenon.\nJust on this account this phenomenon, if it once exists, is absolutely\nnecessary in its course; in consequence of this alone we can recognise in\nit the nature of the act of will, and accordingly _eventualiter_ will\notherwise.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nAbstract.\n\nSCHOPENHAUER’S ESSAY ON THE FOURFOLD ROOT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SUFFICIENT\nREASON (Fourth Edition, Edited by FRAUENSTÄDT. The First Edition appeared\nin 1813).\n\nThis essay is divided into eight chapters. The first is introductory. The\nsecond contains an historical review of previous philosophical doctrines\non the subject. The third deals with the insufficiency of the previous\ntreatment of the principle, and prescribes the lines of the new departure.\nThe fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh treat of the four classes of objects\nfor the subject, and the forms of the principle of sufficient reason which\nrespectively characterise these classes. The eighth contains general\nremarks and results. It will be convenient to summarise these chapters\nseverally.\n\nChapter I.\n\nSchopenhauer points out that Plato and Kant agree in recommending, as the\nmethod of all knowledge, obedience to two laws:—that of Homogeneity, and\nthat of Specification. The former bids us, by attention to the points of\nresemblance and agreement in things, get at their kinds, and combine them\ninto species, and these species again into genera, until we have arrived\nat the highest concept of all, that which embraces everything. This law\nbeing transcendental, or an essential in our faculty of reason, assumes\nthat nature is in harmony with it, an assumption which is expressed in the\nold rule: _Entia præter necessitatem non esse multiplicanda._ The law of\nSpecification, on the other hand, is stated by Kant in these words:\n_Entium varietates non temere esse minuendas._ That is to say, we must\ncarefully distinguish the species which are united under a genus, and the\nlower kinds which in their turn are united under these species; taking\ncare not to make a leap, and subsume the lower kinds and individuals under\nthe concept of the genus, since this is always capable of division, but\nnever descends to the object of pure perception. Plato and Kant agree that\nthese laws are transcendental, and that they presuppose that things are in\nharmony with them.\n\nThe previous treatment of the principle of sufficient reason, even by\nKant, has been a failure, owing to the neglect of the second of these\nlaws. It may well be that we shall find that this principle is the common\nexpression of more than one fundamental principle of knowledge, and that\nthe necessity, to which it refers, is therefore of different kinds. It may\nbe stated in these words: _Nihil est sine ratione cur potius sit, quam non\nsit._ This is the general expression for the different forms of the\nassumption which everywhere justifies that question “Why?” which is the\nmother of all science.\n\nChapter II.\n\nSchopenhauer in this chapter traces historically the forms in which the\nprinciple had been stated by his predecessors, and their influence. He\npoints out that in Greek philosophy it appeared in two aspects—that of the\nnecessity of a ground for a logical judgment, and that of a cause for\nevery physical change—and that these two aspects were systematically\nconfounded. The Aristotelian division, not of the forms of the principle\nitself, but of one of its aspects, the causal, exemplified a confusion\nwhich continued throughout the Scholastic period. Descartes succeeds no\nbetter. His proof of the existence of God that the immensity of His nature\nis a _cause or reason_ beyond which no cause is needed for His existence,\nsimply illustrates the gross confusion between cause and ground of\nknowledge which underlies every form of this ontological proof. “That a\nmiserable fellow like Hegel, whose entire philosophy is nothing but a\nmonstrous amplification of the ontological proof, should dare to defend\nthis proof against Kant’s criticism of it is an alliance of which the\nontological proof itself, little as it knows of shame, might well feel\nashamed. It is not to be expected I should speak respectfully of people\nwho have brought philosophy into disrespect.” Spinoza made the same\nconfusion when he laid it down that the cause of existence was either\ncontained in the nature and definition of the thing as it existed, or was\nto be found outside that thing. It was through this confusion of the\nground of knowledge with the efficient cause that he succeeded in\nidentifying God with the world. The true picture of Spinoza’s “_Causa\nsui_” is Baron Munchhausen encircling his horse with his legs, and raising\nhimself and the horse upwards by means of his pigtail, with the\ninscription “_Causa sui_” written below. Leibnitz was the first to place\nthe principle of sufficient reason in the position of a first principle,\nand to indicate the difference between its two meanings. But it was Wolff\nwho first completely distinguished them, and divided the doctrine into\nthree kinds: _principium fiendi_ (cause), _principium essendi_\n(possibility), and _principium cognoscendi_. Baumgarten, Reimarus,\nLambert, and Platner added nothing to the work of Wolff, and the next\ngreat step was Hume’s question as to the validity of the principle. Kant’s\ndistinction of the logical or formal principle of knowledge—Every\n_proposition_ must have its ground; from the transcendental or material\nprinciple, Every _thing_ must have its ground—was followed out by his\nimmediate successors. But when we come to Schelling we find the\nproposition that gravitation is the _reason_ and light the _cause_ of\nthings, a proposition which is quoted simply as a curiosity, for such a\npiece of nonsense deserves no place among the opinions of earnest and\nhonest inquirers. The chapter concludes by pointing out the futility of\nthe attempts to prove the principle. Every proof is the exhibition of the\nground of a judgment which has been expressed, and of which, just because\nthat ground is exhibited, we predicate truth. The principle of sufficient\nreason is just this expression of the demand for such a ground, and he who\nseeks a proof, _i.e._, the exhibition of a ground for this principle\nitself, presupposes it as true, and so falls into the circle of seeking a\nproof of the justification of the demand for proof.\n\nChapter III.\n\nIn the third chapter Schopenhauer points out that the two applications of\nthe principle of sufficient reason distinguished by his predecessors, to\njudgments, which must have a ground, and to the changes of real objects,\nwhich must have a cause, are not exhaustive. The reason why the three\nsides of a certain triangle are equal is that the angles are equal, and\nthis is neither a logical deduction nor a case of causation. With a view\nto stating exhaustively the various kinds into which the application of\nthe principle falls it is necessary to determine the nature of the\nprinciple itself. All our ideas are objects of the subject, and all\nobjects of the subject are our ideas. But our ideas stand to one another\nas a matter of fact in an orderly connection, which is always determinable\n_a priori_ in point of form, and on account of which nothing that is in\nitself separate and wholly independent of other things can be the object\nof our consciousness. It is this connection which the principle of\nsufficient reason in its generality expresses. The relations which\nconstitute it are what Schopenhauer calls its root, and they fall into\nfour classes, which are discussed in the four following chapters.\n\nChapter IV.\n\nIn the fourth chapter Schopenhauer deals with the first class of objects\nfor the subject and the form of the principle of sufficient reason which\nobtains in it. This first class is that of those complete ideas of\nperception which form part of our experience, and which are referable to\nsome sensation of our bodies. These ideas are capable of being perceived\nonly under the forms of Space and Time. If time were the only form there\nwould be no coexistence, and therefore no persistence. If space were their\nonly form there would be no succession, and therefore no change. Time may\ntherefore be defined as the possibility of mutually exclusive conditions\nof the same thing. But the union of these two forms of existence is the\nessential condition of reality, and this union is the work of the\nunderstanding (see “World as Will and Idea,” vol. i. § 4, and the table of\npredicables annexed to vol. ii., chap. 4). In this class of objects for\nthe subject the principle of sufficient reason appears as the law of\ncausality or the principle of sufficient reason of becoming, and it is\nthrough it that all objects which present themselves in perception are\nbound together through the changes of their states. When a new state of\none or more objects makes its appearance it must have been preceded by\nanother on which it regularly follows. This is causal sequence, and the\nfirst state is the cause, the second the effect. The law has thus to do\nexclusively with the _changes_ of objects of external experience, and not\nwith things themselves, a circumstance which is fatal to the validity of\nthe cosmological proof of the existence of God. It follows also from the\nessential connection of causality with succession that the notion of\nreciprocity, with its contemporaneous existence of cause and effect, is a\ndelusion. The chain of causes and effects does not affect either matter,\nwhich is that in which all changes take place, or the original forces of\nnature, through which causation becomes possible, and which exist apart\nfrom all change, and in this sense out of time, but which yet are\neverywhere present (_e.g._, chemical forces, see _supra_, vol. i., § 26).\nIn nature causation assumes three different forms; that of cause in the\nnarrow sense, of stimulus, and of motive, on which differences depend the\ntrue distinctions between inorganic bodies, plants, and animals. It is\nonly of cause properly so called that Newton’s third law of the equality\nof action and reaction is true, and only here do we find the degree of the\neffect proportionate to that of the cause. The absence of this feature\ncharacterises stimulation. Motive demands knowledge as its condition, and\nintelligence is therefore the true characteristic of the animal. The three\nforms are in principle identical, the difference being due to the degrees\nof receptivity in existence. What is called freedom of the will is\ntherefore an absurdity, as is also Kant’s “Practical Reason.” These\nresults are followed by an examination of the nature of vision, which\nSchopenhauer sums up in these words: “I have examined all these visual\nprocesses in detail in order to show that the understanding is active in\nall of them, the understanding which, by apprehending every change as an\neffect and referring it to its cause, creates on the basis of the _a\npriori_ and fundamental intuitions or perceptions of space and time, the\nobjective world, that phenomenon of the brain, for which the sensations of\nthe senses afford only certain data. And this task the understanding\naccomplishes only through its proper form, the law of causality, and\naccomplishes it directly without the aid of reflection, that is, of\nabstract knowledge through concepts and words, which are the material of\nsecondary knowledge, of thought, thus of the Reason.” “What understanding\nknows aright is reality; what reason knows aright is truth, _i.e._, a\njudgment which has a ground; the opposite of the former being illusion\n(what is falsely perceived), of the latter error (what is falsely\nthought).” All understanding is an immediate apprehension of the causal\nrelation, and this is the sole function of understanding, and not the\ncomplicated working of the twelve Kantian Categories, the theory of which\nis a mistaken one. A consequence of this conclusion is, that arithmetical\nprocesses do not belong to the understanding, concerned as they are with\nabstract conceptions. But it must not be forgotten that between volition\nand the apparently consequential action of the body there is no causal\nrelation, for they are the same thing perceived in two different ways.\nSection 23 contains a detailed refutation of Kant’s proof of the _a\npriori_ nature of the causal relation in the “Second Analogy of\nExperience” of the Critique of Pure Reason, the gist of the objection\nbeing that the so‐called subjective succession is as much objective in\nreality as what is called objective by Kant: “Phenomena may well follow\none another, without following _from_ one another.”\n\nChapter V.\n\nThe fifth chapter commences with an examination of the distinction between\nman and the brutes. Man possesses _reason_, that is to say, he has a class\nof ideas of which the brutes are not capable, _abstract_ ideas as\ndistinguished from those ideas of perception from which the former kind\nare yet derived. The consequence is, that the brute neither speaks nor\nlaughs, and lacks all those qualities which make human life great. The\nnature of _motives_, too, is different where abstract ideas are possible.\nNo doubt the actions of men follow of necessity from their causes, not\nless than is the case with the brutes, but the kind of sequence through\nthought which renders choice, _i.e._, the conscious conflict of motives,\npossible is different. Our abstract ideas, being incapable of being\nobjects of perception, would be outside consciousness, and the operations\nof thought would be impossible, were it not that they are fixed for sense\nby arbitrary signs called words, which therefore always indicate _general_\nconceptions. It is just because the brutes are incapable of general\nconceptions that they have no faculty of speech. But thought does not\nconsist in the mere presence of abstract ideas in consciousness, but in\nthe union and separation of two or more of them, subject to the manifold\nrestrictions and modifications which logic deals with. Such a clearly\nexpressed conceptual relation is a judgment. In relation to judgments the\nprinciple of sufficient reason is valid in a new form: that of the ground\nof knowing. In this form it asserts that if a judgment is to express\nknowledge it must have a ground; and it is just because it has a ground\nthat it has ascribed to it the predicate true. The grounds on which a\njudgment may depend are divisible into four kinds. A judgment may have\nanother judgment as its ground, in which case its truth is formal or\n_logical_. There is no truth except in the relation of a judgment to\nsomething outside it, and intrinsic truth, which is sometimes\ndistinguished from extrinsic logical truth, is therefore an absurdity. A\njudgment may also have its ground in sense‐perception, and its truth is\nthen material truth. Again, those forms of knowledge which lie in the\nunderstanding and in pure sensibility, as the conditions of the\npossibility of experience, may be the ground of a judgment which is then\nsynthetical _a priori_. Finally, those formal conditions of all thinking\nwhich lie in the reason may be the ground of a judgment, which may in that\ncase be called metalogically true. Of these metalogical judgments there\nare four, and they were long ago discovered and called laws of thought.\n(1.) A subject is equal to the sum of its predicates. (2.) A subject\ncannot at once have a given predicate affirmed and denied of it. (3.) Of\ntwo contradictorily opposed predicates one must belong to every subject.\n(4.) Truth is the relation of a judgment to something outside it as its\nsufficient reason. Reason, it may be remarked, has no material but only\nformal truth.\n\nChapter VI.\n\nThe third class of objects for the subject is constituted by the formal\nelement in perception, the forms of outer and inner sense, space and time.\nThis class of ideas, in which time and space appear as pure intuitions, is\ndistinguished from that other class in which they are objects of\nperception by the presence of matter which has been shown to be the\nperceptibility of time and space in one aspect, and causality which has\nbecome objective, in another. Space and time have this property, that all\ntheir parts stand to one another in a relation in which each is determined\nand conditioned by another. This relation is peculiar, and is intelligible\nto us neither through understanding nor through reason, but solely through\npure intuition or perception _a priori_. And the law according to which\nthe parts of space and time thus determine one another is called the law\nof sufficient reason of _being_. In space every position is determined\nwith reference to every other position, so that the first stands to the\nsecond in the relation of a consequence to its ground. In time every\nmoment is conditioned by that which precedes it. The ground of being, in\nthe form of the law of sequence, is here very simple owing to the\ncircumstance that time has only one dimension. On the nexus of the\nposition of the parts of space depends the entire science of geometry.\nGround of _knowledge_ produces _conviction_ only, as distinguished from\n_insight_ into the ground of being. Thus it is that the attempt, which\neven Euclid at times makes, to produce _conviction_, as distinguished from\ninsight into the ground of being, in geometry, is a mistake, and induces\naversions to mathematics in many an admirable mind.\n\nChapter VII.\n\nThe remaining class of objects for the subject is a very peculiar and\nimportant one. It comprehends only one object, the immediate object of\ninner sense, the subject in volition which becomes an object of knowledge,\nbut only in inner sense, and therefore always in time and never in space;\nand in time only under limitations. There can be no knowledge of\nknowledge, for that would imply that the subject had separated itself from\nknowledge, and yet knew knowledge, which is impossible. The subject is the\ncondition of the existence of ideas, and can never itself become idea or\nobject. It knows itself therefore never as _knowing_, but only as\n_willing_. Thus what we know in ourselves is never what knows, but what\nwills, the will. The identity of the subject of volition with the subject\nof knowledge, through which the word “I” includes both, is the insoluble\nproblem. The identity of the knowing with the known is inexplicable, and\nyet is immediately present. The operation of a motive is not, like that of\nall other causes, known only from without, and therefore indirectly, but\nalso from within. Motivation is, in fact, causality viewed from within.\n\nChapter VIII.\n\nIn this, the concluding chapter, Schopenhauer sums up his results.\nNecessity has no meaning other than that of the irresistible sequence of\nthe effect where the cause is given. All necessity is thus conditioned,\nand absolute or unconditioned necessity is a contradiction in terms. And\nthere is a fourfold necessity corresponding to the four forms of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason:—(1.) The logical form, according to the\nprinciple of the ground of knowledge; on account of which, if the\npremisses are given, the conclusion follows. (2.) The physical form,\naccording to the law of causality; on account of which, if the cause is\ngiven, the effect must follow. (3.) The mathematical form, according to\nthe law of being; on account of which every relation expressed by a true\ngeometrical proposition is what it is affirmed to be, and every correct\ncalculation is irrefutable. (4.) The moral form, on account of which every\nhuman being and every brute must, when the motive appears, perform the\nonly act which accords with the inborn and unalterable character. A\nconsequence of this is, that every department of science has one or other\nof the forms of the principle of sufficient reason as its basis. In\nconclusion, Schopenhauer points out that just because the principle of\nsufficient reason belongs to the _a priori_ element in intelligence, it\ncannot be applied to the entirety of things, to the universe as inclusive\nof intelligence. Such a universe is mere phenomenon, and what is only true\nbecause it belongs to the form of intelligence can have no application to\nintelligence itself. Thus it is that it cannot be said that the universe\nand all things in it exist because of something else. In other words, the\ncosmological proof of the existence of God is inadmissible.\n\nAboriginals, interference with, iii. 411.\n\nAbsolute, conception of, has reality only in matter, ii. 94;\n  how not to be conceived, ii. 94;\n  misuse of, ii. 94, 215, 216, 393.\n\nAbstract, idea, knowledge, dependent on idea of perception, i. 45, 52, 53,\n            ii. 258;\n  insufficiency of, i. 72, ii. 248‐251;\n  opposite of idea of perception, i. 7;\n  philosophy must not start from, ii. 261 _seq._;\n  relation to intuitive knowledge, ii. 54, 55, 91;\n  use of, ii. 235, 238.\n\nAbsurd, sphere of, ii. 242;\n  supremacy of, i. 418.\n\nAcademies, relation of, to great men, ii. 496.\n\nAccident.

I.\n\nPage xxxii. _insert_\n\nWhat is true and genuine would more easily gain room in the world if it\nwere not that those who are incapable of producing it are also sworn to\nprevent it from succeeding. This fact has already hindered and retarded,\nwhen indeed it has not choked, many a work that should have been of\nbenefit to the world. For me the consequence of this has been, that\nalthough I was only thirty years old when the first edition of this work\nappeared, I live to see this third edition not earlier than my seventy‐\nsecond year. Yet for this I find comfort in the words of Petrarch: _Si\nquis tota die currens, pervenit ad vesperam satis est_ (_de vera\nSapientia_, p. 140). If I also have at last arrived, and have the\nsatisfaction at the end of my course of seeing the beginning of my\ninfluence, it is with the hope that, according to an old rule it will\nendure long in proportion to the lateness of its beginning.\n\nIn this third edition the reader will miss nothing that was contained in\nthe second, but will receive considerably more, for, on account of the\nadditions that have been made in it, it has, with the same type, 136 pages\nmore than the second.\n\nSeven years after the appearance of the second edition I published two\nvolumes of “Parerga and Paralipomena.” What is included under the latter\nname consists of additions to the systematic exposition of my philosophy,\nand would have found its right place in these volumes, but I was obliged\nto find a place for it then where I could, as it was very doubtful whether\nI would live to see this third edition. It will be found in the second\nvolume of the said “Parerga,” and will be easily recognised from the\nheadings of the chapters.\n\nFRANKFORT‐ON‐THE‐MAINE,\n_September 1859_.\n\nPage  xiv. line 9, _for_ “pancorum” _read_ “paucorum.”\n\"    xix.  \"  17, _for_ “alchemists” _read_ “adepts.”\n\"     xx.  \"  10, _after_ “there” _insert_ “unanimous.”\n\"    xxi.  \"   3, _for_ “will appeal to any thinking mind no matter when\n            it comprehends it” _read_ “will also some time be comprehended\n            by another thinking mind.”\n\"   xxii. last line, _after_ “not” _insert_ “in this case.”\n\"  xxiii. line 26, _for_ “conceptions” _read_ “conception.”\n\"    \"     \"   32, _for_ “origin” _read_ “stem.”\n\"   xxiv.  \"   20, _for_ “a chromatic” _read_ “an achromatic.”\n\"      6, line 15, _for_ “universality” _read_ “common or reciprocal\n            nature.”\n\"     21,  \"   31, _for_ “Σιδωλ” _read_ “Ειδωλ.”\n\"     31,  \"    7, _for_ “micrometre” _read_ “micrometer.”\n\"     41,  \"   11, _for_ “θαυμαξειν” _read_ “θαυμαζειν.”\n\"     45,  \"   22, _after_ “its” _insert_ “iron.”\n\"     45,  \"   23, _for_ “extend to” _read_ “quench.”\n\"     48,  \"   31, _for_ “λογιμον” _read_ “λογικον.”\n\"     49,  \"   22, _after_ “to” _insert_ “abstract”.\n\"     50,  \"   14, _after_ “function” _insert_ “the construction of the\n            concept.”\n\"     62,  \"   26, _for_ “Kallisthenes” _read_ “Callisthenes.”\n\"     75,  \"    1, _for_ “fictum” _read_ “fictam.”\n\"     91,  \"   18, _for_ “latter” _read_ “former.”\n\"     93, lines 8 and 33, _for_ “νουμενον” _read_ “νοουμενον.”\n\"     99, line 17, _for_ “42” _read_ “32.”\n\"    114,  \"    7, _for_ “ευδαι μονειν” _read_ “ενδαιμονειν.”\n\"    116  note, _for_ “εφαρμοεξειν” _read_ “εφαρμοζειν.”\n\"    117, line, 30, _for_ “ψνχης” _read_ “ψυχης.”\n\"    118, lines 10, 12, _for_ “Kleanthes” _read_ “Cleanthes.”\n\"    119, line  7, _for_ “philospher” _read_ “philosopher.”\n\"    141,  \"   18, _for_ “Σστιν” _read_ “Εστιν.”\n\"    146,  \"   23, _for_ “became” _read_ “become.”\n\"    157, line  4, _for_ “casuality” _read_ “causality.”\n\"    166,  \"    3, _insert_",

In order to know Hume one must read his “Natural\n      History of Religion” and his “Dialogues on Natural Religion.” There\n      one sees him in his greatness, and these, together with Essay 21 “Of\n      National Characters,” are the writings on account of which—I know of\n      nothing that says more for his fame—even to the present day, he is\n      everywhere hated by the English clergy.\n\n    6 This chapter is connected with § 29 of the first volume.\n\n    7 In the _Siècle_, 10th April 1859, there appears, very beautifully\n      written, the story of a squirrel that was magically drawn by a\n      serpent into its very jaws: “Un voyageur qui vient de parcourir\n      plusieurs provinces de l’ile de Java cite un exemple remarqueable du\n      pouvoir facinateur des serpens. Le voyageur dont il est question\n      commençait à gravir Junjind, un des monts appelés par les Hollandais\n      Pepergebergte. Après avoir pénétré dans une épaisse forêt, il\n      aperçut sur les branches d’un kijatile un écureuil de Java à tête\n      blanche, folâtrant avec la grâce et l’agilité qui distinguent cette\n      charmante espèce de rongeurs. Un nid sphérique, formé de brins\n      flexible et de mousse, placé dans les parties les plus élevées de\n      l’arbre, a l’enfourchure de deux branches, et une cavité dans le\n      tronc, semblaient les points de mire de ses jeux. A peine s’en\n      était‐il éloigné qu’il y revenait avec une ardeur extrême. On était\n      dans le mois de Juillet, et probablement l’écureuil avait en haut\n      ses petits, et dans le bas le magasin à fruits. Bientôt il fut comme\n      saisi d’effroi, ces mouvemens devinrent désordonnés, on eut dit\n      qu’il cherchait toujours à mettre un obstacle entre lui et certaines\n      parties de l’arbre: puis il se tapit et resta immobile entre deux\n      branches. Le voyageur eut le sentiment d’un danger pour l’innocente\n      bête, mais il ne pouvait deviner lequel. Il approcha, et un examen\n      attentif lui fit découvrir dans un creux du tronc une couleuvre\n      lieu, dardant ses yeux fixes dans la direction de l’écureuil. Notre\n      voyageur trembla pour le pauvre écureuil. La couleuvre était si\n      attentive à sa proie qu’elle ne semblait nullement remarquer la\n      présence d’un homme. Notre voyageur, qui était armé, aurait donc\n      prevenir en aide à l’infortuné rongeur en tuant le serpent. Mais la\n      science l’emporta sur la pitié, et il voulut voir quelle issue\n      aurait le drame. Le dénoûment fut tragique. L’écureuil ne tarda\n      point à pousser un cri plaintif qui, pour tous ceux qui le\n      connaissent, dénote le voisinage d’un serpent. Il avança un peu,\n      essaya de reculer, revint encore en avant, tâche de retourner en\n      arrière. Mais s’approcha toujours plus du reptile. La couleuvre,\n      roulée en spirale, la tête au dessus des anneaux, et immobile comme\n      un morceau de bois, ne le quittait pas du regard. L’écureuil, de\n      branche en branche, et descendant toujours plus bas, arriva jusqu’à\n      la partie nue du tronc. Alors le pauvre animal ne tenta même plus de\n      fuir le danger. Attiré par une puissance invincible, et comme poussé\n      par le vertige, il se précipita dans la gueule du serpent, qui\n      s’ouvrit tout à coup démesurément pour le recevoir. Autant la\n      couleuvre avait été inerte jusque là autant elle devint active dès\n      qu’elle fut en possession de sa proie. Déroulant ses anneaux et\n      prenant sa course de bas en haut avec une agilité inconcevable, sa\n      reptation la porta en un clin d’œil au sommet de l’arbre, où elle\n      alla sans doute digérer et dormir.”\n\n      In this example we see what spirit animates nature, for it reveals\n      itself in it, and how very true is the saying of Aristotle quoted\n      above (p. 106). This story is not only important with regard to\n      fascination, but also as an argument for pessimism. That an animal\n      is surprised and attacked by another is bad; still we can console\n      ourselves for that; but that such a poor innocent squirrel sitting\n      beside its nest with its young is compelled, step by step,\n      reluctantly, battling with itself and lamenting, to approach the\n      wide, open jaws of the serpent and consciously throw itself into\n      them is revolting and atrocious. What monstrous kind of nature is\n      this to which we belong!\n\n    8 “_Augustini de civit. Dei_,” L. xi. c. 27, deserves to be compared\n      as an interesting commentary on what is said here.\n\n    9 This chapter is connected with §§ 30‐32 of the first volume.\n\n   10 This chapter is connected with §§ 33‐34 of the first volume.\n\n   11 This chapter is connected with § 36 of the first volume.\n\n   12 There is nothing else in the world but the vulgar.\n\n   13 In Medwin’s “Conversations of Lord Byron,” p. 333.\n\n   14 This chapter is connected with the second half of § 36 of the first\n      volume.\n\n   15 _Rgya Tcher Rol Pa, Hist. de Bouddha Chakya Mouni, trad. du\n      Tibétain_, p. _Foucaux_, 1848, p. 91 et 99.\n\n   16 In German inferiors are sometimes addressed as _Er_ instead of\n      _Sie_.—_Trs._\n\n   17 This chapter is connected with § 38 of the first volume.\n\n   18 This chapter is connected with § 49 of the first volume.\n\n   19 This chapter is connected with § 43 of the first volume.\n\n   20 This chapter is connected with §§ 44‐50 of the first volume.\n\n   21 This chapter is connected with § 51 of the first volume.\n\n   22 Lichtenberg (“_Vermischte Schriften_,” new edition, Göttingen, 1884,\n      vol. iii. p. 19) quotes Stanislaus Leszczynski as having said, “_La\n      modestie devroit être la vertu de ceux, a qui les autres manquent_.”\n\n   23 This chapter is connected with § 51 of the first volume.\n\n   24 Let me remark in passing that from this opposition of ποιησις and\n      ἱστορια the origin, and also the peculiar significance, of the first\n      word comes out with more than ordinary distinctness; it signifies\n      that which is made, invented, in opposition to what is discovered.\n\n   25 This chapter is connected with § 52 of the first volume.\n\n   26 It would be a false objection that sculpture and painting are also\n      merely in space; for their works are connected, not directly, but\n      yet indirectly, with time, for they represent life, movement,\n      action. And it would be just as false to say that poetry, as speech,\n      belongs to time alone: this is also true only indirectly of the\n      words; its matter is all existent, thus spatial.\n\n   27 This chapter is connected with § 54 of the first volume.\n\n   28 _In gladiatoriis pugnis timidos et supplices, et, ut vivere liceat,\n      obsecrantes etiam odisse solemus; fortes et animosos, et se acriter\n      ipsos morti offerentes servare cupimus_ (_Cic. pro Milone_, c. 34).\n\n   29 The suspension of the _animal_ functions is sleep, that of the\n      _organic_ functions is death.\n\n   30 There is only _one present_, and this is always: for it is the sole\n      form of actual existence. One must attain to the insight that the\n      _past_ is not _in itself_ different from the present, but only in\n      our apprehension, which has time as its form, on account of which\n      alone the present exhibits itself as different from the past. To\n      assist this insight, imagine all the events and scenes of human\n      life, bad and good, fortunate and unfortunate, pleasing and\n      terrible, as they successively present themselves in the course of\n      time and difference of places, in the most checkered\n      multifariousness and variety, as _at once and together_, and always\n      present in the _Nunc stans_, while it is only apparently that now\n      this and now that is; then what the objectification of the will to\n      live really means will be understood. Our pleasure also in _genre_\n      painting depends principally upon the fact that it fixes the\n      fleeting scenes of life. The dogma of metempsychosis has proceeded\n      from the feeling of the truth which has just been expressed.\n\n   31 This posthumous essay is to be found in the “Essays on Suicide and\n      the Immortality of the Soul” by the late David Hume, Basil, 1799,\n      sold by James Decker. By this reprint at Bâle these two works of one\n      of the greatest thinkers and writers of England were rescued from\n      destruction, when in their own land, in consequence of the stupid\n      and utterly contemptible bigotry which prevailed, they had been\n      suppressed through the influence of a powerful and insolent\n      priesthood, to the lasting shame of England. They are entirely\n      passionless, coldly rational investigations of the two subjects\n      named.\n\n   32 Death says: Thou art the product of an act which should not have\n      been; therefore to expiate it thou must die.\n\n   33 _Sancara, s. de theologumenis Vedanticorum_, ed. F. H. H.\n      Windischmann, p. 37; “_Oupnekhat_,” vol. i. p. 387 _et_ p. 78;\n      Colebrooke’s “Miscellaneous Essays,” vol. i. p. 363.\n\n   34 The etymology of the word Nirvana is variously given. According to\n      Colebrooke (“Transact. of the Royal Asiat. Soc.,” vol. i. p. 566) it\n      comes from _va_, “to blow,” like the wind, and the prefixed negative\n      _nir_, and thus signifies a calm, but as an adjective\n      “extinguished.” Obry, also, _Du Nirvana Indien_, p. 3, says:\n      “_Nirvanam en sanscrit signifie à la lettre extinction, telle que\n      celle d’un feu_.” According to the “Asiatic Journal,” vol. xxiv. p.\n      735, the word is really Neravana, from _nera_, “without,” and\n      _vana_, “life,” and the meaning would be _annihilatio_. In “Eastern\n      Monachism,” by Spence Hardy, p. 295, Nirvana is derived from _vana_,\n      “sinful desires,” with the negative _nir_. J. J. Schmidt, in his\n      translation of the history of the Eastern Mongolians, says that the\n      Sanscrit word Nirvana is translated into Mongolian by a phrase which\n      signifies “departed from misery,” “escaped from misery.” According\n      to the learned lectures of the same in the St. Petersburg Academy,\n      Nirvana is the opposite of Sanfara, which is the world of constant\n      re‐birth, of longings and desires, of illusion of the senses and\n      changing forms, of being born, growing old, becoming sick, and\n      dying. In the Burmese language the word Nirvana, according to the\n      analogy of other Sanscrit words, becomes transformed into Nieban,\n      and is translated by “complete vanishing.” See Sangermano’s\n      “Description of the Burmese Empire,” translated by Tandy, Rome,\n      1833,",

    "page_content": "36 Lichtenberg says in his miscellaneous writings (Göttingen, 1801,\n      vol. ii. p. 447): “In England it was proposed to castrate thieves.\n      The proposal is not bad: the punishment is very severe; it makes\n      persons contemptible, and yet leaves them still fit for trades; and\n      if stealing is hereditary, in this way it is not propagated.\n      Moreover, the courage ceases, and since the sexual passion so\n      frequently leads to thefts, this cause would also disappear. The\n      remark that women would so much the more eagerly restrain their\n      husbands from stealing is roguish, for as things are at present they\n      risk losing them altogether.”\n\n   37 I have not ventured to express myself distinctly here: the courteous\n      reader must therefore translate the phrase into Aristophanic\n      language.\n\n   38 The fuller discussion of this subject will be found in the\n      “Parerga,” vol. ii. § 92 of the first edition (second edition, pp.\n      167‐170).\n\n   39 [The appendix to this chapter was added only in the third edition of\n      the German, and is meant to explain, in consistency with\n      Schopenhauer’s general principles, the wide prevalence of the\n      practice of pederasty, among different nations and in different\n      ages. It is omitted.—_Trs._]\n\n   40 This chapter is connected with § 60 of the first volume.\n\n   41 This chapter is connected with §§ 56‐59 of the first volume. Also\n      chapters 11 and 12 of the second volume of the “Parerga and\n      Paralipomena” should be compared with it.\n\n   42 All that we lay hold of resists us because it has its own will,\n      which must be overcome.\n\n   43 This chapter is connected with §§ 55, 62, 67 of the first volume.\n\n   44 This chapter is connected with § 68 of the first volume. Chapter 14\n      of the second volume of the Parerga should also be compared with it.\n\n   45 If, on the contrary, asceticism is admitted, the list of the\n      ultimate motives of human action, given in my prize essay on the\n      foundation of morals, namely: (1) our own good, (2) the ill of\n      others, and (3) the good of others, must be supplemented by a\n      fourth, our own ill; which I merely mention here in passing in the\n      interests of systematic consistency. In the essay referred to this\n      fourth motive had to be passed over in silence, for the question\n      asked was stated in the spirit of the philosophical ethics\n      prevailing in Protestant Europe.\n\n   46 _Cf._ F. H. H. Windischmann’s _Sancara, sive de theologumenis\n      Vedanticorum_, pp. 116, 117, 121; and also _Oupnekhat_, vol. i. pp.\n      340, 356, 360.\n\n   47 Cf. _Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik_, p. 274 (second edition, p.\n      271).\n\n   48 If we keep in view the essential immanence of our knowledge and of\n      all knowledge, which arises from the fact that it is a secondary\n      thing which has only appeared for the ends of the will, it then\n      becomes explicable to us that all mystics of all religions\n      ultimately attain to a kind of ecstasy, in which all and every\n      knowledge, with its whole fundamental form, object and subject,\n      entirely ceases, and only in this sphere, which lies beyond all\n      knowledge, do they claim to have reached their highest goal, for\n      they have then attained to the sphere in which there is no longer\n      any subject and object, and consequently no more knowledge, just\n      because there is no more will, the service of which is the sole\n      destiny of knowledge.\n\n      Now, whoever has comprehended this will no longer regard it as\n      beyond all measure extravagant that Fakirs should sit down, and,\n      contemplating the tip of their nose, seek to banish all thought and\n      perception, and that in many passages of the Upanischads\n      instructions are given to sink oneself, silently and inwardly\n      pronouncing the mysterious Oum, in the depths of one’s own being,\n      where subject and object and all knowledge disappear.\n\n   49 _S.

On this\n      opportunity one may see how certain Protestant theologians, in their\n      efforts to misinterpret the text of the New Testament in conformity\n      with their rationalistic, optimistic, and unutterably shallow view\n      of life, go so far that they actually falsify this text in their\n      translations.

Schott, in his new version given with the\n      Griesbach text of 1805, has translated the word κοσμος, John xv. 18,\n      19, by _Judœi_, 1 John iv. 4, by _profani homines_; and Col. ii. 20,\n      στοιχεια του κοσμον by _elementa Judaica_; while Luther everywhere\n      renders the word honestly and correctly by “_Welt_” (world).\n\n   54 _Unusquisque tantum juris habet, quantum potentiâ valet_ (_Tract.\n      pol._, c. 2 § 8). _Fides alicui data tamdiu rata manet, quamdiu\n      ejus, qui fidem dedit, non mutatur voluntas_ (_Ibid._, § 12).\n      _Uniuscujusque jus potentiâ ejus definetur_ (_Eth._ iv., _pr._ 37,\n      _schol._ 1.) Especially chap. 16 of the _Tractatus theologico‐\n      politicus_ is the true compendium of the immorality of Spinoza’s\n      philosophy.\n\n   55 [In preparing this Index Frauenstädt’s _Schopenhauer‐Lexikon_ has\n      been freely used.—_Trs._]",
