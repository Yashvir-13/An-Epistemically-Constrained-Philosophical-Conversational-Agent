During this free and\neasy discussion of his life and conditions, directed by the law of\nassociation of ideas, reference was invariably made to the experiences\nor thoughts which were the most affective and disturbing elements.

Memory gaps were frequent,\nrelations twisted, etc. Evidently some force banished these memories so\nthat the person was quite honest in saying that he could remember\nnothing or that there was nothing to tell. This kind of forgetfulness\nwas called _repression_, and is the normal mechanism by which nature\nprotects the individual from such painful feelings as are caused by\nunpleasant and unacceptable experiences and thoughts, the recognition of\nhis egoistic nature, and the often quite unbearable conflict of his\nweaknesses with his feelings of idealism."

The influence and controlling power of the unconscious\ndesires over our thoughts and acts are in this relative proportion.\nFaint glimmers of other motives and interests than those we accept or\nwhich we believe, often flit into consciousness. These indications, if\nstudied or valued accurately, would lead to the realization that\nconsciousness is but a single stage and but one form of expression of\nmind. Therefore its dictum is but one, often untrustworthy, approach to\nthe great question as to what is man\u2019s actual psychic accomplishment,\nand as to what in particular is the actual soul development of the\nindividual."

Meanwhile, their outward\nmanifestations can change almost endlessly. One might therefore consider\nthe first poem as an unconscious longing to solve the conflict through\npositive religiousness, somewhat in the same manner as they of the\nearlier centuries decided their conscious conflicts by opposing to them\nthe religious standpoint. This wish does not succeed. Now with the\nsecond poem there follows a second attempt which turns out in a\ndecidedly more material way; its thought is unequivocal. Only once\n\u201chaving gained one raptured glance ...\u201d and then\u2014to die."

An example of this is given us by Shakspeare in \u201cHenry VI.,\u201d pt.\niii., act 3, sc. 2 and 3. All this depends upon the fact that the species,\nas that in which the root of our being lies, has a closer and earlier\nright to us than the individual; hence its affairs take precedence. From\nthe feeling of this the ancients personified the genius of the species in\nCupid, a malevolent, cruel, and therefore ill\u2010reputed god, in spite of his\nchildish appearance; a capricious, despotic demon, but yet lord of gods\nand men:"

Forsaken by this spirit, the individual falls back into its\noriginal limitation and narrowness, and sees with wonder that after such a\nhigh, heroic, and infinite effort nothing has resulted for its pleasure\nbut what every sexual gratification affords. Contrary to expectation, it\nfinds itself no happier than before. It observes that it has been the dupe\nof the will of the species. Therefore, as a rule, a Theseus who has been\nmade happy will forsake his Ariadne.
