## 💡 Qualitative Sample
- **Q**: How does aesthetic contemplation suspend the will?
  - **Winner**: Fathom
  - **Reason**: Answer A maintains Schopenhauer's distinction between Will and Representation, avoids psychologizing aesthetics, and adopts the appropriate pessimistic tone. Answer B conflates the suspension of the will with a psychological shift in its drive.
- **Q**: Does aesthetic contemplation deny the will metaphysically?
  - **Winner**: Fathom
  - **Reason**: Answer A correctly distinguishes between suspension of the will and metaphysical denial, remaining within the phenomenological realm of aesthetic experience. Answer B commits the error of psychologizing and over-metaphysicalizing the aesthetic state.
- **Q**: Is the state of beauty permanent for the genius?
  - **Winner**: Fathom
  - **Reason**: Both answers grasp the fleeting nature of beauty but Answer A avoids conflating aesthetic experience with psychological states. Answer A demonstrates a more Schopenhauerian understanding of beauty as an illusionary manifestation of the Will.
- **Q**: Is music merely a copy of the Ideas like other arts?
  - **Winner**: Fathom
  - **Reason**: Answer A correctly distinguishes Will from Representation and avoids conflating suspension with denial. While Answer B uses Schopenhauerian concepts, it falls into the trap of equating artistic expression with metaphysical embodiment, a common error.
- **Q**: Does the sublime require an element of threat or hostility?
  - **Winner**: Fathom
  - **Reason**: While both answers grapple with the question, Answer A remains more faithful to Schopenhauer's emphasis on aesthetic contemplation and the suspension of the will. Answer B commits a category error by psychologizing the sublime and venturing into ethical and metaphysical claims beyond Schopenhauer's scope.
